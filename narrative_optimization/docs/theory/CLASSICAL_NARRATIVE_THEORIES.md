## Joseph Campbell - The Hero's Journey

**Source**: *The Hero with a Thousand Faces* (1949)

### The Monomyth: 17 Stages

Campbell identified a universal narrative structure across world mythologies, divided into three acts:

#### Act I: Departure (Separation)

1. **Ordinary World**: Hero's normal life before the adventure
2. **Call to Adventure**: Problem/challenge presents itself
3. **Refusal of the Call**: Hero hesitates or refuses (fear, doubt, inadequacy)
4. **Meeting the Mentor**: Wise figure provides guidance/training/magical gift
5. **Crossing the First Threshold**: Hero commits to the adventure, enters special world

#### Act II: Initiation (Descent)

6. **Tests, Allies, and Enemies**: Hero faces trials, makes friends/enemies
7. **Approach to the Inmost Cave**: Hero approaches the central ordeal
8. **Ordeal (The Abyss)**: Greatest fear, death/rebirth moment, supreme challenge
9. **Reward (Seizing the Sword)**: Hero survives death, gains treasure/knowledge
10. **The Road Back**: Hero must return to ordinary world
11. **Resurrection**: Final test, hero transformed by journey
12. **Return with the Elixir**: Hero brings wisdom/power back to benefit others

#### Extended Stages (from *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*)

13. **Supernatural Aid**: Magical helper appears
14. **Belly of the Whale**: Final separation from known world
15. **Meeting with the Goddess**: Experience unconditional love
16. **Woman as Temptress**: Temptation to abandon quest
17. **Atonement with the Father**: Confrontation with ultimate power

### Key Concepts

- **Monomyth**: Universal story pattern across all cultures
- **Archetypal Journey**: Psychological/spiritual transformation
- **Death and Rebirth**: Central metaphor of transformation
- **Return**: Completing the circle by sharing wisdom

### Mathematical Properties

- **Completion Score**: Percentage of 17 stages present (0-1)
- **Stage Order**: Sequential vs. non-linear progression
- **Transformation Depth**: Magnitude of change from start to finish

## Christopher Vogler - The Writer's Journey

**Source**: *The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers* (1992, 2007)

### 12-Stage Adaptation of Campbell

Vogler simplified Campbell's model for practical screenwriting:

1. **Ordinary World**: Establish normal life
2. **Call to Adventure**: Inciting incident
3. **Refusal of the Call**: Hesitation/fear
4. **Meeting with the Mentor**: Preparation/training
5. **Crossing the First Threshold**: Point of no return (Act I → Act II)
6. **Tests, Allies, Enemies**: Rising action in special world
7. **Approach to the Inmost Cave**: Preparation for major challenge
8. **Ordeal**: Midpoint crisis, "death" experience
9. **Reward**: Consequence of surviving ordeal
10. **The Road Back**: Decision to return (Act II → Act III)
11. **Resurrection**: Final climactic test
12. **Return with Elixir**: Resolution, hero changed

### Character Archetypes (Vogler's 8)

1. **Hero**: Protagonist on journey
2. **Mentor**: Teacher/protector/conscience
3. **Threshold Guardian**: Tests hero's commitment
4. **Herald**: Announces need for change
5. **Shapeshifter**: Creates doubt/suspense (often love interest)
6. **Shadow**: Antagonist/villain/dark side
7. **Ally**: Companion/sidekick
8. **Trickster**: Comic relief/catalyst for change

### Differences from Campbell

- **Simplified**: 12 stages vs 17
- **Flexible**: Stages can repeat or vary in order
- **Character-focused**: Emphasis on archetypal roles
- **Practical**: Designed for screenwriters

   - Unity of action (single complete action)
   - Probability and necessity
   - Beginning, middle, end

   - Staging, costumes, effects

### Structure of Tragedy

**Three Unities** (later interpretation):

      ↓                ↓           ↓            ↓
   Plot Pt 1      Pinch 1    Midpoint    Plot Pt 2

## Robert McKee - Story

**Source**: *Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting* (1997)

### Core Principles

#### The Story Spine

**Quest**: What does the protagonist want?
- Conscious desire (surface goal)
- Unconscious need (deeper transformation)

**Forces of Antagonism**: What opposes the protagonist?
- Not just villains
- Internal conflicts
- Social institutions
- Environmental forces
- Fate/coincidence

#### Story Values

- Every scene must change a value from positive to negative or vice versa
- **Core Value**: What's at stake in the entire story?
  - Life/Death
  - Love/Hate
  - Freedom/Slavery
  - Truth/Lies
  - Success/Failure

#### The Gap

- **Gap**: Difference between expectation and result
- Creates surprise and meaning
- Wider gap = more powerful storytelling

### Story Design Principles

#### Five-Part Structure

1. **Inciting Incident**: Disrupts life balance
2. **Progressive Complications**: Hero encounters obstacles
3. **Crisis**: Most difficult choice
4. **Climax**: Action taken at crisis point
5. **Resolution**: New life balance

#### Beat, Scene, Sequence, Act, Story

- **Beat**: Smallest unit (action/reaction)
- **Scene**: Units of beats, changes value charge
- **Sequence**: Chain of scenes building to climax
- **Act**: Major reversal, changes story direction
- **Story**: Complete change in protagonist's life

### Character Dimensionality

#### Three Levels

1. **Characterization**: Observable traits (age, appearance, occupation)
2. **True Character**: Deep nature revealed under pressure
3. **Character Arc**: Transformation through story

#### Character Types

- **Simple/Flat**: One dimension (comedy, action)
- **Complex/Round**: Multiple, contradictory traits
- **Static**: No change (James Bond)
- **Dynamic**: Transforms through story

### Genre Conventions

McKee emphasizes knowing genre conventions:
- **Obligatory Scenes**: Audience expects
- **Conventional Sequences**: Standard for genre
- **Turning Point Strategies**: Genre-specific

### The Controlling Idea

**Format**: [Value] + [Cause]
- **Example**: "Love triumphs when we sacrifice self-interest" (Casablanca)
- Single sentence capturing story's meaning
- Guides all creative decisions

### Reality Types

1. **Actual Reality**: Real world
2. **Plausible Reality**: Believable fiction
3. **Implausible Reality**: Exaggerated but accepted
4. **Impossible Reality**: Fantasy, sci-fi

**Psychological Meaning**: Death and rebirth, transformation, redemption

### Meta-Plot: The Deep Structure

Booker argues all seven plots share underlying pattern:
1. Incomplete hero in limited state
2. Encounters challenge/opportunity
3. Journey toward completion
4. Either achieves wholeness (comedy, rebirth, quest) or fails (tragedy)

### Jungian Foundation

- **Self**: The complete, integrated personality
- **Shadow**: Repressed/denied aspects
- **Anima/Animus**: Opposite-gender aspects
- **Individuation**: Journey toward wholeness

All seven plots are metaphors for psychological integration.

## Cross-Theory Synthesis

### Universal Elements

All theories recognize:
1. **Beginning-Middle-End**: Three-part structure
2. **Transformation**: Protagonist changes
3. **Conflict**: Central to narrative
4. **Resolution**: Story must conclude
5. **Pattern**: Stories follow recognizable shapes

### Complementary Approaches

- **Macro Level**: Campbell, Booker (overall journey)
- **Meso Level**: Field, Snyder (act/sequence structure)
- **Micro Level**: McKee (scene/beat dynamics)
- **Character Level**: Jung, Vogler (psychological depth)
- **Thematic Level**: Frye, Aristotle (meaning/genre)

### Integration Possibility

These theories are not contradictory but complementary:
- Campbell provides mythic backbone
- Vogler makes it practical
- Field/Snyder provide precise timing
- Jung adds psychological depth
- McKee adds craft principles
- Frye provides thematic context
- Vonnegut provides emotional trajectory
