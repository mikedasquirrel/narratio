Hurricane Names Experiments

Tests the hypothesis that hurricane name characteristics (gender, syllables,
memorability) predict perceived threat, evacuation rates, and casualties.

Research Foundation: Jung et al. (2014)
- Feminine names → 8.2% lower evacuation
- R² = 0.11, p = 0.008
- Gender effect: d = 0.38, p = 0.004
