Linguistic Transformers

Based on formal linguistics theory, implemented via AI semantic analysis.
NO hardcoded word lists. ALL patterns discovered through embeddings.

Transformers:
1. ActantialStructureTransformer: Greimas' actantial model (6 roles)
2. ConceptualMetaphorTransformer: Lakoff's conceptual metaphors
3. LabovianNarrativeTransformer: Labov's narrative structure (6 components)
4. DiscourseAnalysisTransformer: van Dijk's macro/micro structure
5. NarrativeSemioticsTransformer: Greimas' semiotic square
6. LinguisticResonanceTransformer: Phonetic and etymological pattern analysis

Philosophy:
- Use linguistics THEORY for what to measure
- Use AI for HOW to measure
- Preserve sequential/multi-stream structure
- Let patterns emerge from semantic space
