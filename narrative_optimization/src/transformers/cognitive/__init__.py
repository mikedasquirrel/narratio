Cognitive Science Transformers

Based on cognitive psychology and neuroscience research.
Implemented via AI, preserving multi-stream sequential structure.

Transformers:
1. CognitiveLoadTransformer: Working memory constraints (Baddeley, Cowan)
2. EmbodiedMetaphorTransformer: Physical grounding (Lakoff, Johnson)
3. ScriptDeviationTransformer: Schema violations (Schank, Abelson)
4. AttentionalStructureTransformer: Peak-End rule (Kahneman)
5. MemorabilityTransformer: Memory/forgetting (Ebbinghaus)

Philosophy:
- Cognitive constraints are REAL (not social constructs)
- Measure cognitive compatibility WITHOUT interpretation
- Let AI discover cognitive patterns
- Keep mechanisms elusive
