validation_hypotheses:
  # EMPIRICAL DISCOVERY APPROACH
  - "Narrative clarity distribution will be bimodal (story vs abstract songs)"
  - "Some genres cluster high-narrative (discover which empirically)"
  - "Some genres cluster low-narrative (discover which empirically)"
  - "Narrative predicts success ONLY in high-narrative genres"
  - "Campbell journey detection will be near-zero for most songs"
  - "Journey detection will be high (>0.60) for concept albums/story songs"
  - "Emotional arc detected across ALL songs (even non-narrative)"
  - "Character archetypes rare in music (3-minute constraint)"
  - "First-person narrative will dominate when narrative present"
  - "π_song will range from 0.15 (abstract) to 0.85 (story songs)"
  - "Transformers will empirically segment songs by narrative level"
  - "Genre is NOT destiny - within-genre variation expected"
  
  # Key discoveries to validate:
  - "DISCOVERY 1: Which % of music has narrative structure?"
  - "DISCOVERY 2: Which genres are most/least narrative?"
  - "DISCOVERY 3: Does narrative predict success in some genres only?"
  - "DISCOVERY 4: Are there narrative songs in 'non-narrative' genres?"
