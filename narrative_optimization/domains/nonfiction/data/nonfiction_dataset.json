Westover recounts overcoming her survivalist Mormon family in order to go to college and emphasizes the importance of education in enlarging her world.

It won a 2019 Alex Award and was shortlisted for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, PEN America's Jean Stein Book Award, and two awards from the National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nWestover lived in isolation in Buck's Peak, Idaho with her parents, pseudonymously referred to as Gene and Faye Westover respectively, and the rest of her family. Gene was paranoid about hospitals, public education, and the government, partially due to the siege at Ruby Ridge. Faye consequently homeschools the Westover children. Gene denies Westover's attempts to seek normality in her life. Her brother Shawn initially helps her and the two grow closer, but he starts physically abusing her as she befriends Charles, a boy she meets while performing in theater. Another of Westover's brothers, Tyler, learns of the abuse and encourages her to leave home and take the ACT to be able to apply to Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. Westover is later admitted to BYU under a scholarship. Shawn reconciles with her after standing up to Gene on her behalf.\nAfter her acceptance, Tara Westover studies at Brigham Young University and receives scholarships allowing her to continue attending. The pressure of maintaining her grades in order to keep her scholarship results in Westover feeling stressed. Additionally, her alienation from the outside world and lack of formal schooling become issues. Later, she reconnects with Charles but is unable to act romantically towards him because of her conservative upbringing. Remembering Gene's and Shawn's abuse towards her results in Westover terminating her relationship with Charles.\nWestover now feels alienated in Idaho and worries that Gene may have bipolar disorder. She cuts ties with him but reconnects after he expresses interest in her life at school. After Shawn marries Emily, a young woman he was dating, Tara worries about Emily, who previously expressed fear of Shawn. Tara confides to one of her professors about her family's background. Her professor encourages her to apply for the studying abroad program at Cambridge. After arriving at King's College in Cambridge, Tara Westover is assigned to work with Professor Jonathan Steinberg. Both of her professors encourage her to attend graduate school. Tara Westover applies for and wins the Gates Scholarship and forms a temporary truce with Gene. The two previously fell out over how she chronicled her past to local news outlets and her decision to attend school in England.\nAfter returning to Cambridge, Westover takes steps to be part of the world, including getting immunized for vaccinations her family rejected. She occasionally returns to Idaho where she learns that Shawn is still abusing Emily. Her sister, Audrey, learned about Shawn's behavior, but Faye does not believe her. Westover and Faye take up email correspondence through which the latter suggests that Gene is mentally ill and writes about how they plan to get Shawn the help he needs. On another trip home, Shawn briefly shows signs of change but later accuses Audrey of lying about his abusive behavior and threatens to kill her. Gene and Faye do not take their daughter seriously when she tells them about Shawn's threat.\nTara encounters Shawn with a bloody knife on another visit home. Terrified, she lies that Gene lied about Shawn's treatment to Audrey. Later, she realizes that Faye had never been on her or Audrey's side. After returning to Cambridge, Shawn threatens her life. Audrey also cuts ties with Westover, claiming she is under Satan's control. Tara then begins graduate school at Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts and her parents briefly visit trying to convince her to come home.\nAfter returning home again, Tara Westover discovers that Erin, Shawn's ex-girlfriend, wrote to Faye that she was delusional and demonizing her brother. Tara returns to Harvard and eventually Cambridge. After suffering panic attacks, she ends contact with her parents for a year, attempting to recover. She struggles in her studies, however Tyler encourages her and she successfully completes her PhD degree. Years later, Westover returns to Idaho for her maternal grandmother's funeral. She reunites with Tyler, his wife, two maternal aunts, and her other siblings, most of whom still take Gene's and Shawn's side. At the end of the memoir, Tara Westover is in touch with only a few family members and accepts that she needs to be away from the mountain.\n\n\n== People featured in the book ==\n\n\n=== Westover family ===\nGene Westover (pseudonym for Val) is Westover's father, who did not believe in public education or doctors.He owns a metal scrapyard in Idaho.\nFaye Westover (pseudonym for LaRee) is Westover's mother, a midwife and herbal specialist.

He would say these things about public education and doctors and the government and we didn't know any better. We didn't go to school so as far as we knew the world was exactly the way our father described it.\" Westover received an undergraduate degree at Brigham Young University and her PhD degree at Cambridge.\nWestover decided to write the book after she confronted her parents about her brother's abuse, and the resulting conflict led to her becoming estranged from some members of her family. She began searching for stories to help her understand what had happened. In 2018, she told The New York Times, \"I wrote the book I wished I could have given to myself when I was losing my family. When I was going through that experience, I became aware of how important stories are in telling us how to live—how we should feel, when we should feel proud, when we should feel ashamed. I was losing my family, and it seemed to me that there were no stories for that—no stories about what to do when loyalty to your family was somehow in conflict with loyalty to yourself... forgiveness. I wanted a story about forgiveness that did not conflate forgiveness with reconciliation, or did not treat reconciliation as the highest form of forgiveness. In my life, I knew the two might always be separate. I didn't know if I would ever reconcile with my family, and I needed to believe that I could forgive, regardless.\"\nWestover said that she set out to explore the complexity of difficult family relationships. In an interview with The Irish Times in Dublin she said, \"You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them, and you can miss someone every day and still be glad they're not in your life.\" Her parents' attorney said that \"Her parents raised their family in what Tara described as an extremist mindset, but what they felt was self-sufficiency.\" They maintain that there is only a \"little germ of truth\" in her book. Their attorney said Westover's parents were hurt that Westover would write a book which slanders her upbringing and that she would accuse her brother [Shawn] of the abuse described. Tara Westover's mother later published a book entitled \"Educating\" that provides her perspective on some of the events described in \"Educated.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEducated was an instant #1 New York Times bestseller and was positively reviewed by The New York Times, The Atlantic, USA Today, Vogue,The Economist, and Literary Review which praised Westover's writing as \"crisp, persuasive and heartbreaking in its honesty.\" The book was also nominated for a number of national awards including the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, PEN America's Jean Stein Book Award, and two awards from the National Book Critics Circle Award.\nEducated in hardcover spent more than two years on the New York Times bestseller list and is being translated into 45 languages. The New York Times ranked Educated as one of the 10 Best Books of 2018,  and The American Booksellers Association named Educated the Nonfiction Book of the Year. As of December 2020, the book has sold more than 8 million copies.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nWestover's book earned many awards and accolades:\n\n2021: IndieBound's Indie Biography & Memoir Bestseller List\n2019: American Library Association's (ALA) Top Ten Amazing Audiobooks for Young Adults\n2019: Outstanding Books for the College Bound\n2019: Westover chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019\n2019: ALA's Alex Award\n2018: The National Book Critics Circle Award for Autobiography\n2018: One of The New York Times' 10 Best Books\n2018: Amazon Editors' pick for the Best Book of 2018\nNamed the Book of the Year by the American Booksellers Association\nFinalist for the John Leonard Prize from the National Book Critics Circle\nFinalist for the Autobiography Award from the National Book Critics Circle\nFinalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in Biography\nFinalist for PEN/America's Jean Stein Award\nFinalist for the  American Booksellers Association Audiobook of the Year Award\nFinalist for Barnes & Noble's Discover Great Writers Award\nLong-listed for the Carnegie Medal of Excellence\nWinner of the Goodreads Choice Award for Autobiography\nWinner of the Audie Award for Autobiography/Memoir\nApple's Best Memoir of the Year\nAudible's Best Memoir of the Year\nHudson Group Best Book of the Year\nPresident Barack Obama's pick for summer reading and his Favorite Books of the Year list \nBill Gates' Holiday Reading list \nEducated named one of the Best Books of the year by The Washington Post, O, The Oprah Magazine, Time, NPR, Good Morning America, The San Francisco Chronicle, The Guardian, The Economist, Financial Times, The New York Post, The Skimm, Bloomberg, Real Simple, Town & Country, Bustle, Publishers Weekly, The Library Journal, Book Riot, and the New York Public Library.\nFeatured speaker, Seattle Arts & Lectures, 2019\n\n\n== References ==",

One million copies were donated to First Book, an American nonprofit organization which provides books to children.\nIt was the highest-selling book published in the United States in 2018, setting the record 15 days after its publication, with over two million copies sold.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe 448-page memoir was published on November 13, 2018. Barack Obama said Michelle had a ghostwriter. The Observer notes that Becoming's acknowledgments section thanks a team of people involved in finishing the book.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book's 24 chapters (plus a preface and epilogue) are divided into three sections: Becoming Me, Becoming Us, and Becoming More.\nThe preface sets the stage for Michelle Obama's story to open by sketching a scene in her post-First Lady life. Becoming Me traces Obama's early life growing up on the South Side of Chicago with her parents, Fraser and Marian Robinson, in an upstairs apartment where she got her first piano lessons and learnt to be an independent girl under the nurturing care of her parents. There, Obama shared a bedroom with her brother Craig. The book continues through her education at Princeton University and Harvard Law School to her early career as a lawyer at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met Barack Obama. While this section talks considerably at length about Obama's Princeton experience and Sidley Austin, Harvard Law school's experiences are mentioned marginally by comparison.\nBecoming Us departs from the beginning of the Obamas' romantic relationship and follows their marriage and the beginning of his political career in the Illinois State Senate. This section also notes Obama's career \"swerve\" from corporate law to the non-profit realm as she continued to work while raising her daughters and speaking at political events, becoming gradually more involved in her husband's campaign. The book shares Obama's balance between her position as the first African American First Lady of the United States of America, her motherly duties, and her marital commitments. The section ends with election night in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States.\nBecoming More takes the readers through Barack Obama's presidency, Michelle Obama's focus on her Let's Move campaign, and her role of \"head mom in chief\" to her two daughters - Malia and Sasha Obama, along with the other aspects of the Obama's life as first family. The Epilogue talks about the last day of Obamas in the White House which was also Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony and Michelle Obama's reflection on Optimism. She also expresses her lack of desire to ever run for office.\n\n\n== Book sales ==\nTotal book sales, including hardcover, audio, and e-book editions, sold around 725,000 copies in the United States and Canada during its first day, making it the second best-selling debut for any book in 2018. Bob Woodward's Fear: Trump in the White House holds the record after selling around 900,000 copies during its first day. However, Barnes and Noble reported that Becoming surpassed Fear in first-week sales and had more first-week sales of any adult book since Go Set a Watchman in 2015. The book sold 1.4 million copies in its first week. After 15 days, the book became the best-selling book in the US for the year 2018.\nBy March 26, 2019, Becoming had sold 10 million copies. According to The New York Times, as of November 2020, the book has \"sold 14 million copies worldwide, including more than 8 million in the U.S. and Canada\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIt was an Oprah's Book Club 2.0 selection.\nThe book was given over 42,000 ratings and over 41,000 reviews on Goodreads and received 4.55 out of 5 stars. Hannah Giogris, a writer from The Atlantic, used the words \"refreshing\" and \"striking\" to describe the book.\nIn 2020, the audiobook edition won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album and was named one of the top ten Amazing Audiobooks for Young Adults by the American Library Association.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nAmerican musician Questlove curated a soundtrack for the book called The Michelle Obama Musiaqualogy.\n\n\n== Tour ==\nIn November 2018, Michelle Obama went on a national book tour conducted in arenas, often to sold-out crowds starting in Chicago at the United Center. Obama previewed the book and tour on Chicago's Windy City Live daytime television show at her alma mater, Whitney M. Young Magnet High School on Chicago's Near West Side.\nThe initial tour included 12 venues in 10 cities but expanded with its popularity; as of February 2019, another 21 cities had been added, including six in Europe and four in Canada.\n\n\n== Film ==\n\nIn May 2020, a documentary film based on the book was released on Netflix, following Obama through her book tour. The documentary features footage of Obama's travels behind-the-scenes of the tour and clips of her interviews onstage with moderators, including Oprah Winfrey and Stephen Colbert.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nArabic: وأصبحتُ, translated by M.

    "full_narrative": "Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood is an autobiographical comedy book written by South African comedian Trevor Noah, published in 2016. The book focuses on Noah's childhood growing up in his native South Africa after he was born of an illegal interracial relationship during the apartheid era. The book was a bestseller and has received overwhelmingly positive reviews.\n\n\n== Narrative ==\nThe book details Trevor Noah's experiences growing up in South Africa during the apartheid era. Noah's parents were a white Swiss-German father and a black Xhosa mother. At the time of Noah's birth in 1984, their interracial relationship was illegal under the Immorality Act, 1957. According to Noah, \"for [him] to be born as a mixed-race baby\" was to be \"born a crime.\" Interracial relations were decriminalised when the Immorality Act was amended in 1985. As a mixed-race person, Noah was classified as a \"Coloured\" in accordance to the apartheid system of racial classification. Noah was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandmother in Soweto. \nIn large part, the book is a paean to Noah's mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo, who grew up in a hut with fourteen occupants. Noah describes his mother as being stubborn, fearless, and an extraordinary teacher. She was a fiercely religious woman who took her son to three churches every Sunday, a prayer meeting on Tuesday, Bible study on Wednesday and youth church on Thursday, even when black South Africans were rioting in the streets and most people were cowering in their homes.\nThe book opens with young Noah being thrown out of a minibus by his mother because she thought the driver, a man from another South African tribe, was going to kill them. Noah develops social and mental agility, using his fluency in languages to break barriers to his acceptance as a mixed race child. Growing up in poverty, he finds independence by earning money from selling illegal bootleg CDs, first at school and later on the streets of the notorious neighborhood of Alexandra. Noah describes the struggle of living with his abusive stepfather Abel. Through it all, his mother administers tough love and \"old-school, Old Testament discipline\". When Noah is arrested while driving an unregistered car taken from Abel's workshop without permission, he describes his fear of doing time in prison, and his mother lays down the law about crime and punishment. The book ends with the story of Patricia being shot in the head by Abel while she was returning from church with her family, and her miraculous survival.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPublished in November 2016, Born a Crime was received favorably by major U.S. book reviewers. It became a No. 1 New York Times Bestseller and was named one of the best books of the year by The New York Times, Newsday, Esquire, NPR, and Booklist. In early 2017, its title was used as a clue in the New York Times Crossword Puzzle, and has been used two more times, in 2019 and 2020.\nU.S. senator Tammy Duckworth cited Born a Crime as the book that inspired her to write her 2021 memoir Every Day Is a Gift, in which she relates her experiences as the child of a white American father and a Thai mother. Former first Lady Jill Biden, an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, assigned Born a Crime as required reading for an introductory English course.\n\n\n=== Film adaptation ===\nIn 2018, it was announced that the memoir would be adapted into a film starring Lupita Nyong'o as Patricia, Noah's mother. Nyong'o was set to produce the film with Noah through his production company, Ark Angel Productions. In March 2018, Liesl Tommy was hired to direct the film, which would be produced by Paramount Players.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInterview with Noah on Born a Crime, November 13, 2016, C-SPAN",

Rapid weight loss and severe back and chest pains begin to raise concern for him and his wife, Lucy Kalanithi. He worries that cancer might have caused his symptoms and his decline in health – unlikely for people in their thirties. However, when the X-ray results in a routine medical check-up return normal, he and his primary care physician attribute the symptoms to aging and work overload.\nDetermined to finish the last months of his residency, he ignores whatever symptoms have not subsided.

He worries that cancer might have caused his symptoms and his decline in health – unlikely for people in their thirties. However, when the X-ray results in a routine medical check-up return normal, he and his primary care physician attribute the symptoms to aging and work overload.\nDetermined to finish the last months of his residency, he ignores whatever symptoms have not subsided. A few weeks later, the symptoms come back, stronger than before. Around this time, Kalanithi and his wife experience conflict in their relationship when Lucy feels that he is not communicating with her. Visiting friends in New York, Kalanithi is almost certain that he has cancer and says it out loud for the first time to his friend Mike. Returning home, upon landing in San Francisco, Kalanithi receives a call from his doctor telling him that his lungs \"look blurry.\" When he arrives home with Lucy, both of them know what is happening. The next day, Kalanithi checks in to the hospital, and the room where he examined his patients, delivering good and bad news, becomes his own.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nBefore writing When Breath Becomes Air, Kalanithi was in residency in neurological surgery and a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience. In May 2013, he was diagnosed with stage-4 non-small-cell EGFR-positive lung cancer.\nAs Kalanithi underwent cancer treatment, he shared his reflections on illness and medicine, authoring essays in The New York Times, The Paris Review, and Stanford Medicine, and participating in interviews for media outlets and public forums. He also began work on an autobiographical book of his experiences as a doctor and a patient facing a terminal illness.\nKalanithi died in March 2015 at the age of 37. His memoir was published posthumously 10 months later. The book includes a foreword by Abraham Verghese and an epilogue by Kalanithi's widow, Lucy Goddard Kalanithi.\n\n\n=== Paul Kalanithi ===\nThe author of the book, Paul Kalanithi, was born in Bronxville, New York, on April 1, 1977. At the age of 10, his family moved to Kingman, Arizona, where he spent most of his youth. At the early age of 10, his mother gave him books to read in order to educate his young mind. Kalanithi attended Stanford University where he earned a Bachelor and Master of Arts in English literature and a Bachelor of Science in human biology. He attended Cambridge for history and philosophy of science and medicine where he obtained his masters. After Cambridge, Kalanithi attended Yale for medical school where he met his future wife, Lucy Goddard. After graduating from Yale, they got married and began their residencies in California. Kalanithi started his residency back at Stanford while his wife attended the University of California, San Francisco. Paul and Lucy have a daughter together.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nFollowing the prospect of a better life, Kalanithi's father moves the family from Bronxville, New York, to Kingman, Arizona, when Kalanithi is ten. A doctor himself, Kalanithi's father dedicates most of his time to medicine and is notably absent from the house. Believing that to be a doctor, he would have to be away from the family like his father, Kalanithi becomes disenchanted with medicine. Although he and his two brothers enjoy the newfound liberty of their desert town, their mother constantly worries about their academic future in a town that the U.S. census has declared “the least educated district in America.” Unwilling to let anything halt their learning, she acquires college reading lists and instills in her sons a love for literature. The summer before heading to Stanford University for school, Kalanithi reads Satan, His Psychotherapy and Cure by the Unfortunate Dr. Kassler, J.S.P.S., by Jeremy Leven. The book's idea that the mind is the result of the brain doing its work awakes a curiosity in Kalanithi for neuroscience.\nAfter completing degrees in English literature and human biology, Kalanithi feels there is still much to learn. He is accepted to a master's program in English literature at Stanford, and one afternoon—pushed by his desire to understand the meaning of life— discovers the calling to practice medicine for the first time. Preparing to apply to medical school, Kalanithi uses the time off to study the history and philosophy of science and medicine at Cambridge. He later starts medical school at Yale. During his time at Yale, Kalanithi meets his wife, Lucy, and sees the patient-doctor relationship as an example of life, death, and morality coming together. After two years of classroom learning, Kalanithi experiences his first birth and death in his OB-GYN clinical rotation, when a set of twins could not be carried to term. It is then that Kalanithi understands that intelligence is not enough in the practice of medicine and that morality is also needed. After medical school, Lucy Kalanithi starts an internal medicine residency at UCSF, and Paul Kalanithi begins a neurosurgical residency at Stanford. Though he finds it hard at first, Kalanithi grows used to the rigor of neurosurgery and, in his fourth year, joins the neuroscience lab of a professor affectionately called “V.” In the sixth year of residency, Kalanithi returns to his hospital duties and having reached professional recognition, he feels he has finally found his place in the world.\nKalanithi's life takes an unexpected turn when, after weeks of health problems, it is confirmed that he has lung cancer. Images obtained from a CT scan show organ systems compromised by cancer, causing him and his wife great sadness. Searching for the best experts in the field of oncology, Kalanithi begins treatment with a doctor named Emma Hayward. Because of his status, rather than stepping back and letting Hayward offer her professional opinion, Kalanithi expects to be treated as a consultant, even if it is his own case. Hayward suggests finding the root of his cancer before determining treatment options. In the meantime, Kalanithi's family helps him through his transition from doctor to patient, and together with Lucy, he decides to explore reproductive options before he dies. They visit a sperm bank and make a decision to have a child. Test results arrive, and Kalanithi discovers that his cancer is derived from a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This fact gives him a bit of relief because it means that he can be treated with Tarceva, which typically results in less-severe side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy.\nSymptoms subside with the treatment, and in Dr. Hayward's office, Kalanithi feels like himself again. After weeks of using the medication, CT scans show a reduced number of tumors in Kalanithi's lungs, and he becomes determined to return to the operating room. Back in the OR, he cannot finish his first surgery because of his health. However, his strength and technique improve over time. With both graduation and a baby due in June, he takes another CT scan after months since the last. He discovers a big tumor in his right lung, and without getting scared, he and Lucy research what other options are available. Kalanithi retires from surgery indefinitely and begins chemotherapy. His response to chemotherapy is adverse, and his health worsens, forcing him to skip graduation. With the failure of chemotherapy, other treatment options do not provide him much hope. His condition becomes so severe that even Dr. Hayward gives an approximation of how much time he has left – something she had strongly refused to do before. On July 4, 2014, their daughter was born and Kalanithi is filled with joy. Eventually, Kalanithi dies in the intensive care unit of his hospital.\nThe epilogue is written by his wife, Lucy Kalanithi, after his death. It shows her point of view on the experience with her husband Paul Kalanithi's lung cancer. It is an in-depth personal explanation of her experience.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWhen Breath Becomes Air is a New York Times bestseller, spending 68 weeks on the non-fiction bestseller list. The book received starred reviews from Kirkus Reviews and Library Journal.\nKirkus called the book a \"moving meditation on mortality by a gifted writer whose dual perspectives of physician and patient provide a singular clarity.\"\nMatt McCarthy of USA Today gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said, \"It's a story so remarkable, so stunning, and so affecting that I had to take dozens of breaks just to compose myself enough to get through it.\" Nick Romeo of The Boston Globe wrote that it \"possesses the gravity and wisdom of an ancient Greek tragedy.\" Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly stated that the book was \"so original—and so devastating. . . . Its only fault is that the book, like his life, ends much too early.\"\n\n\n=== Awards and honors ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"When Breath Becomes Air | Lucy Kalanithi | Talks at Google\".

The book is told in five parts. The first part, \"A Woman On the Street\", documents her conversation with her mother, Rose Mary, who was squatting in an abandoned apartment in New York City, which pushed her to tell the truth and write this memoir.\nPart Two, titled \"The Desert\", covers young Jeannette Walls living with her parents, Rex and Rose Mary, and her siblings Lori and Brian. Walls opens with her first memory, which takes place when she is three years old and is living in a trailer park in southern Arizona. She is engulfed in flames when attempting to make hot dogs over the stove, resulting in her going to the hospital and receiving skin grafts on her stomach, ribs, and chest. Due to fear of the mounting medical bills as well as scepticism of modern medicine, Rex takes Jeannette out of the hospital without permission or paying. A few months later, the children are woken up in the middle of the night and are told they are \"doing the skedaddle\" (skipping town). Their parents' nomadic lifestyle imposed by their avoidance of financial responsibilities results in the family frequently moving about to locations in various states including Nevada, Arizona, and California. As Jeannette grows older, she is more aware of Rex's alcoholism and its consequences. For her 10th birthday, she asks him to stop drinking, which he successfully does for a few months. Following his relapse, Rose Mary decides that since they have no money it is time to move again, and she takes the family to their paternal grandparents in Welch, West Virginia.\nPart Three, titled \"Welch\", covers approximately a seven-year period and documents Jeannette and her siblings' shifting perspectives on life with their parents from being one of adventure and whimsy to abuse and brokenness. While in Welch, the Walls children face bullying, sexual abuse, and hunger. Ultimately, Lori and Jeannette hatch a plan for Lori to move to New York City, with Jeannette following shortly thereafter. Eventually, Lori moves, and Jeannette joins her shortly before finishing high school.\nIn Part Four, \"New York City\", after experiencing the freedom and safety gained from no longer living with her parents, sister Lori offers to help siblings Brian and Maureen move to New York City. Three years after all the children have left Welch, Rose Mary and Rex decide to move to New York City. With little money, the parents fall behind on rent and become homeless. They find themselves at home amongst squatters in an abandoned apartment, and the Walls children discover who they are. Years later, Rex calls Jeannette and tells her that he is dying. A few weeks after they had met and talked about their adventures and struggles, he dies of a heart attack.\nPart Five, titled \"Thanksgiving\", takes place five years after the death of Rex when the family gathers for Thanksgiving at Jeannette's country home where they toast to Rex.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Glass Castle was positively reviewed by The New York Times, Kirkus Reviews, Entertainment Weekly, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, among others. However, several school districts have found the book's inclusion in syllabi to be controversial.\nIn The New York Times Book Review, critic and novelist Francine Prose wrote, \"The autobiographer is faced with the daunting challenge of ... attempting to understand, forgive and even love the witch ... Readers will marvel at the intelligence and resilience of the Walls kids.\"\nA review in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution compared Jeannette Walls to renowned 19th-century writer Charles Dickens, saying that \"Dickens's scenes of poverty and hardship are no more audacious and no more provocative than those in the pages of this stunning memoir.\"\nThe Glass Castle spent more than seven years on the New York Times bestseller list and has been translated into 31 languages. In 2006, the memoir peaked on the list at No.10; however following the release of the film adaptation in 2017, the book became a No.1 New York Times paperback nonfiction best seller and held that position for 15 weeks. As of 2017, the book had sold more than 5 million copies.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe Glass Castle has received the following accolades:\n\nAmerican Library Association (ALA) Alex Award (2006)\nLincoln Award Nominee (2008)\nALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound and Lifelong Learners (2009)\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nThe Glass Castle has also been the subject of public criticism, most notably in high school English classes.\nAccording to the American Library Association, The Glass Castle was the seventeenth most banned and challenged book in the United States 2010 and 2019 and the ninth most challenged book in 2012. The book has been challenged due to offensive language and being sexually explicit.\nIn 2012, in Traverse City, Michigan, West Senior High School's 9th grade honors English class removed the book due to its \"explicit language and references to child molestation, adolescent sexual exploits, and violence.\" It has since been returned to the curricula after the school board reconsideration committee voted to maintain the book.\nIn 2017, the book was again challenged in Marshfield, Wisconsin, resulting in the National Coalition Against Censorship defending it, stating that discussing its themes including \"poverty, hunger, bullying, assault, and alcoholism\" will benefit the students. On March 1, 2017, the committee reviewing the case voted unanimously to recommend keeping the book in the sophomore English curriculum.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nParamount bought the film rights to The Glass Castle, and in October 2015 announced that actress Brie Larson would play Jeannette Walls in the movie adaptation. In August 2014, it was announced that Destin Daniel Cretton was set to direct. Naomi Watts and Woody Harrelson were cast as Rose Mary and Rex Walls, respectively, with Gil Netter producing. Filming began May 20, 2016, in Welch, West Virginia. The film was released August 11, 2017, to mixed reviews praising the performances while noting the film's overall uneven tone. It holds a 51% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCreative nonfiction\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe New York Times Book Review on The Glass Castle\nExcerpt form The Glass Castle in The New York Times Book Review\nThe Glass Castle on Open Library at the Internet Archive",

Strayed's journey begins in the Mojave Desert and she hikes through California and Oregon to the Bridge of the Gods into Washington. The book also contains flashbacks to prior life occurrences that led Strayed to begin her journey.\nAt the age of 22, Strayed had been devastated by the lung cancer death of her mother, who was only 45. Her stepfather disengaged from Strayed's family, and her brother and sister remained distant. Strayed and her husband divorced, and eventually she began to use heroin with a lover.\nSeeking self-discovery and resolution of her enduring grief and personal challenges, at the age of 26, Strayed set out on her journey, alone and with no prior hiking experience. Wild intertwines the stories of Strayed's life before and during the journey, describing her physical challenges, emotional, and spiritual realizations while on the trail.\n\n\n== Distinctions and recognition ==\nMay 30, 2012: Oprah Winfrey announced the launch of Oprah's Book Club 2.0 with Wild as its first selection.\nJuly 15, 2012: Wild reached No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.\nDecember 3, 2012: Wild was named No. 6 best non-fiction book of 2012 by The Christian Science Monitor.\nDecember 4, 2012: Wild was voted No. 1 book of 2012 in the \"Memoir and Autobiography\" category in the \"Goodreads Choice Awards 2012.\"\nJanuary 2013: Wild was selected as Book of the Week on BBC Radio 4, where a five-episode abridgement of the book was read.\n2013: Wild spent 52 weeks on the NPR Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller List.\nApril 2013: For Wild, Strayed received the Reader's Choice Award in the 2013 Oregon Book Awards.\nAs of August 2015: Wild has been translated into 30 languages.\n\n\n== Film ==\n\nBy the time the book was published, actress Reese Witherspoon's film company Hello Sunshine had optioned Wild for film rights. Witherspoon portrayed Strayed in the 2014 film Wild, which was written by the novelist Nick Hornby and directed by Jean-Marc Vallée.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn The New York Times, Dwight Garner wrote that \"the lack of ease in (Strayed's) life made her fierce and funny; she hammers home her hard-won sentences like a box of nails,\" adding that the memoir reflected a \"too infrequent sight: that of a writer finding her voice, and sustaining it, right in front of your eyes.\" \nIn The New York Times, Dani Shapiro called the book \"spectacular... at once a breathtaking adventure tale and a profound meditation on the nature of grief and survival, ... both a literary and human triumph.\" Shapiro wrote that unlike many parallel-arc stories, Strayed's two parallel narratives—the challenging hike itself and the difficult life events that preceded it—are delivered in perfect balance. According to Shapiro, the memoir did not overdramatize its events, but followed a \"powerful, yet understated, imperative to understand (their) meaning,\" allowing readers \"to feel how her actions and her internal struggles intertwine, and appreciate the lessons she finds embedded in the natural world.\"\nIn Slate, Melanie Rehak began by contrasting Wild with the 2006 memoir Eat, Pray, Love—whose story was \"pleasant, mild, romantic, and completely lacking urgency\" and in which everything would work out. In contrast, Wild was said to be \"crammed with... passages of vicious discomfort\" and was carried by a voice that was \"fierce, billowing with energy, precise.\" Crediting the years that passed between Strayed's 1995 hike and her 2012 memoir, Rehak wrote that Strayed had \"fine control\" over \"unfathomable, enormous experiences\" and never wrote \"from a place of desperation in the kind of semi-edited purge state that has marred so many true stories.\"\nBy the time of the film Wild's release, in December 2014 A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times that Strayed's memoir was \"already a classic of wilderness writing and modern feminism.\" In 2019, Anna Leahy wrote  in the Los Angeles Review of Books that Wild was likely the most popular memoir approaching the subject of cancer from the perspectives of loved ones and caregivers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Most Inspiring Quotes from Wild Archived 2014-12-04 at the Wayback Machine at Oprah.com\nWild's page on the author's website (includes pictures) (archive)",

So that was my agenda for writing that book. I wrote it to fulfill my vow to him, which was on his deathbed. In finishing, I did feel that I'd fulfilled my promise.\"\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Foreword ===\nThe memoir opens with the passing of Robert Mapplethorpe, Patti Smith’s close friend and former lover. She is asleep when he takes his last breath in the hospital, having bid him goodnight over the phone. As he struggles under heavy sedation, she senses it will be their final conversation.\nThe next morning, she awakens with a deep intuition of his death. Sitting in her study with a book of Odilon Redon’s artwork, an opera from Tosca plays softly on the TV. Soon after, Mapplethorpe’s younger brother calls to confirm her premonition.\n\n\n=== Monday’s Children ===\nPatti Smith’s childhood begins in South Jersey in the 1950s and early ’60s, growing up in a working-class family with strict Jehovah’s Witness roots. Even as a child, she’s enthralled by books, drawing, and the idea of being an artist. Her influences are Arthur Rimbaud, Bob Dylan, and beat poetry.\nIn 1966, at the age of 19, she gets pregnant after a brief relationship and gives her baby up for adoption. In July 1967, she boards a bus to New York City with only a suitcase, some art supplies, and a copy of Illuminations by Rimbaud.\nShe works at a factory, then at Scribner’s bookstore—barely scraping by. Soon after arriving in the city, she meets Robert Mapplethorpe by chance in Brooklyn. They cross paths again weeks later at Brentano’s bookstore, and their relationship begins. They become inseparable. At first, they pose as a couple to protect each other from unwanted advances; eventually, they fall in love for real.\nNew York is in the middle of social problems—drugs, political unrest, and radical experimentation are everywhere. Smith and Mapplethorpe are focused on becoming artists.\n\n\n=== Just Kids ===\nLiving on practically nothing, they move from apartment to apartment, squatting and sometimes stealing to survive. Patti recalls their magical “bohemian fairy tale” life, where they try to make art out of everything—even poverty. In 1968, they move into the smallest room of the Allerton Hotel, and later into a loft on Hall Street, near the Pratt Institute where Robert had studied.\nRobert begins to experiment with art more seriously—at first collages, talismans, and religious iconography—and later photography, especially after Patti gifts him a Polaroid SX-70 camera. Meanwhile, Patti explores writing poetry, sketches, and begins performing her work at open mics.\nRobert starts to privately explore his sexuality. Though the sexual aspect of their relationship fades, their emotional bond only intensifies. Robert’s inner turmoil is evident: his Catholic guilt, his attraction to men, and his obsession with beauty create tension in his psyche and art. Patti is his muse, but he also begins to explore the erotic male form through photography and relationships with other men.\nIn 1969, Patti starts working at Scribner’s and watches artists like Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick from afar, both fascinated and alienated by their circle. Robert, meanwhile, begins to drift toward Warhol’s Factory, especially after connecting with art collector and curator Sam Wagstaff, who becomes his lover and patron later on.\n\n\n=== Hotel Chelsea ===\nBy 1970, Patti and Robert move into Room 1017 of the Hotel Chelsea, along with artists, writers and musicians. They befriend or observe many artistic figures, such as Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Sam Shepard (with whom Patti has a brief romance and collaborates on the play Cowboy Mouth).\nRobert’s work begins to shift more toward photography, though he’s still hesitant to fully embrace it as his medium. Patti continues writing and drawing, but increasingly feels called to perform. She starts reading her poetry at St. Mark’s Church and the Poetry Project, immersing herself in the downtown literary and performance scenes.\nIn 1973, Patti meets guitarist Lenny Kaye, and together they start adding music to her poetry readings. This marks the beginning of what will become the Patti Smith Group. With the help of manager Jane Friedman, she transitions from poet to proto-punk frontwoman.\n\n\n=== Separate Ways Together ===\nBy 1974, Patti’s music career begins to take off. She records the iconic single “Hey Joe / Piss Factory”, and the Patti Smith Group gains a cult following performing at CBGB’s. In 1975, she releases her groundbreaking debut album Horses, with a cover photo taken by Robert.\nMeanwhile, Robert comes into his own as a photographer. With support from Sam Wagstaff, he begins producing powerful, often controversial images of the male nude, BDSM, and religious iconography. His photographs are both celebrated and criticized for their provocative beauty. He exhibits in major galleries and solidifies his reputation in the art world.\nThe two grow apart physically—Patti marries Fred \"Sonic\" Smith in 1980 and moves to Detroit to start a family, eventually having two children—but she and Robert never lose their connection. They call and write to each other constantly. Robert sends her letters, photos, and small gifts.\nPatti writes that she never stopped being his “guardian”, and he never stopped being her “twin flame”.\n\n\n=== Holding Hands with God ===\nIn 1986, Robert is diagnosed with AIDS. Patti, now living quietly in Detroit, re-enters his life more fully to support him. Robert continues to make art with astonishing discipline, photographing until he physically can’t. Patti visits him in New York and San Francisco, sometimes with her young children.\nThey collaborate once again: she writes poems and texts to accompany his work; he asks her to help curate and narrate his legacy. Patti describes Robert’s final exhibitions, particularly The Perfect Moment, which solidifies his place in art history.\nRobert dies on March 9, 1989, at the age of 42. Patti is with him in his final days, praying, reading poetry, and holding his hand. She mourns him deeply, but finds solace in the promise they made: that she would tell their story.\n\n\n== Title ==\nThe title comes from the chapter \"Just Kids\":\n\nWe were walking toward the fountain of Washington Square Park in New York City, the epicenter of activity, when an older couple stopped and openly observed us. Robert enjoyed being noticed, and he affectionately squeezed my hand.\n\"Oh, take their picture,\" said the woman to her bemused husband, \"I think they're artists.\"\n\n\"Oh, go on,\" he shrugged. \"They're just kids.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nJust Kids won the 2010 National Book Award for Nonfiction.\nIt was Publishers Weekly's Top 10 Best Books (2010), ALA Notable Book (2011), Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist (Current Interest, 2010), New York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 2010), and National Book Critics Circle Award finalist (Autobiography/Memoir, 2010).\nJust Kids was featured on the January 19, 2010, episode of Fresh Air, with Smith being interviewed by Terry Gross.  Just Kids was also featured on KQED's Forum with Michael Krasny on January 28, 2010, and KCRW's Bookworm with host Michael Silverblatt in March 2010. It was the Book of the Week on BBC Radio 4 from 1–5 March 2010, with Smith reading five 15-minute excerpts from her book.\n\n\n== Television series ==\nIn August 2015, it was announced that Showtime was developing a limited series based on the memoir. The network landed the rights partly because Smith wanted to collaborate with writer John Logan, being a fan of his series Penny Dreadful. However, the show has not yet been put in the works.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nReview in The Guardian by Edmund White\nReview on Frontier Psychiatrist by Gina Myers\nReview on Thought Catalog by The Thoughtful Reader\nSmith, Patti (2010-12-29). \"Patti Smith Reflects on Power of Words, Rock 'N' Roll\".

    "full_narrative": "The Year of Magical Thinking is a memoir by Joan Didion, accounting of the year following the death of her husband John Gregory Dunne in 2003. Published by Knopf in October 2005, The Year of Magical Thinking was immediately acclaimed as a classic book about mourning. It won the 2005 National Book Award for Nonfiction and was a finalist for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. In 2024, The New York Times Book Review ranked The Year of Magical Thinking as the 12th best book of the 21st century. It was adapted into a play in 2007.\n\n\n== Structure and themes ==\nThe book recounts Didion's experiences of grief after Dunne's 2003 death. Days before his death, their daughter Quintana Roo Dunne Michael was hospitalized in New York with pneumonia, which developed into septic shock; she was still unconscious when her father died. In 2004, Quintana was again hospitalized after she fell and hit her head disembarking from a plane at Los Angeles International Airport. After learning of her father's death, she returned to Malibu, her childhood home. \nThe book follows Didion's reliving and reanalysis of her husband's death throughout the following year, in addition to caring for Quintana. With each event replay, the focus on specific emotional and physical aspects of the experience shifts. Didion also incorporates medical and psychological research on grief and illness into the book.\nThe title of the book refers to magical thinking in the anthropological sense, thinking that if a person hopes for something enough or performs the correct actions, then an unavoidable event can be averted. Didion reports many instances of her magical thinking, particularly the story in which she cannot give away Dunne's shoes, as he would need them when he returned. The experience of insanity or derangement that is part of grief is a major theme about which Didion was unable to find a great deal of existing literature.\nDidion applies the reportorial detachment for which she is known to her own experience of grieving; there are few expressions of raw emotion. Through observation and analysis of changes in her behavior and abilities, she indirectly expresses the toll her grief is taking. She is haunted by questions about the medical details of her husband's death, the possibility that he sensed it in advance, and how she might have made his remaining time more meaningful. Fleeting memories of events and persistent snippets of past conversations with John take on a new significance. Her daughter's continuing health problems and hospitalizations further compound and interrupt the natural course of grief.\n\n\n== Writing process ==\nDidion wrote The Year of Magical Thinking between October 4 and December 31, 2004, completing it a year and a day after Dunne died. Notes she made during Quintana's hospitalizations became part of the book. Quintana Roo Dunne Michael died of pancreatitis on August 26, 2005, before the book's publication, but Didion did not revise the manuscript. Instead, she devoted a second book, Blue Nights, to her daughter's death.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe New York Times Book Review praised the memoir as \"not a downer. On the contrary. Though the material is literally terrible, the writing is exhilarating, and what unfolds resembles an adventure narrative.\" The New York Review of Books declared, \"I can't imagine dying without this book.\" The American Prospect's mixed review found that the book read \"like a Warren Report on the death of LBJ.\" In 2019, the book was ranked 40th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.\n\n\n== Theatre adaption ==\nOn March 29, 2007, Didion's adaptation of her book for Broadway, directed by David Hare, opened with Vanessa Redgrave as the sole cast member. The play expands upon the memoir by dealing with Quintana's death. It ran for 24 weeks at the Booth Theatre in New York City and the following year Redgrave reprised her role to largely positive reviews at London's National Theatre. This production was set to tour the world, including Salzburg, Athens, Dublin Theatre Festival, Bath and Cheltenham. The play was also performed in the Sydney Theatre Company's 2008 season, starring Robyn Nevin and directed by Cate Blanchett.\nAlso in 2008, it was performed in Barcelona at the Sala Beckett, directed by Òscar Molina and starring Marta Angelat. \nThe play was performed in Canada at the Belfry Theatre in 2009 and at the Tarragon Theatre by Seana McKenna. This production was also mounted in January 2011 as part of English Theatre's season at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.\nOn October 26, 2009, Redgrave reprised her performance again in a benefit production of the play at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in New York City.\nIn January 2010, the play was mounted at the Court Theatre (Chicago), starring Mary Beth Fisher. Fisher won the 2010 \"Jeff\" Solo Performance Award for her performance in the play.\nThe play was mounted in April 2011 by Nimbus Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, starring Barbra Berlovitz and directed by Liz Neerland.\nIn 2011, Fanny Ardant played a French translation of The Year of Magical Thinking in Théâtre de l'Atelier, Paris.\nThe play opened in May 2015 at Teatro Español y Naves del Español in Madrid, Spain, as El Año del Pensamiento Mágico produced by Teatro Guindalera. The production starred Jeannine Mestre and was directed by Juan Pastor Millet. \nThe Norwegian translation of the play premiered in September 2015 at Den Nationale Scene in Bergen, directed by Jon Ketil Johnsen and starring Rhine Skaanes. \nOn November 3, 2017, Stageworks Theatre in Tampa, Florida, opened a production of the play featuring Vickie Daignault. Writing in the Tampa Bay Times, Colette Bancroft noted Daignault's \"skill and subtlety\" and the exploration of grief in Didion's play that was \"raw and refined at once.\"\nBeginning in March 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic forced theatres to close worldwide. In the fall of 2021, productions began to resurface. Cesear's Forum, a minimalist theatre company at Playhouse Square, Cleveland, Ohio, presented the play with Julia Kolibab in a November/December production.\nThe play adaptation, narrated by Redgrave, was released in audio format on Audible in 2020. \n\n\n== Translations ==\nCzech: Víc než další den, lit. 'More Than the Next Day'.

The book details his early childhood in Brooklyn, New York, but focuses primarily on his life in Limerick, Ireland. It also includes his struggles with poverty and his father's alcoholism.\nThe book was published in 1996 and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. The sequel 'Tis was published in 1999, followed by Teacher Man in 2005.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe narrative is told from the point of view of Frank McCourt as a child. Born in Brooklyn, New York on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents immigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela's pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is from Limerick, Ireland, and she is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his having an \"odd manner\" and for telling stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is said to resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same \"odd manner.\" \nIn Brooklyn, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and an indoor lavatory, with other immigrant families. Frankie has four younger siblings in Brooklyn: Malachy, born in 1931; twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935.\nThe family struggles with poverty because Malachy Sr's efforts to find work are complicated by his alcoholism. The family's prospects, and Angela's spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his wages, but soon he spends all of his pay in pubs despite Angela's efforts to prevent him from doing so. Malachy Sr loses each job after a few weeks as a result of his heavy drinking.\nMargaret's birth instills new life into the family: The whole family falls in love with her, Malachy Sr most of all. He stops drinking and finds steady work to support the family. Due to her parents' ignorance of childhood disease, Margaret lives for only seven weeks. With her death, Malachy Sr goes on an alcoholic binge, and Angela suffers severe depression. Frank, age 4, feeds and cares for his younger siblings until the neighbours help. The neighbours contact Angela's cousins, who in turn recommend the family return to Ireland. Angela is pregnant as they return to Ireland from America, but she loses the child shortly after moving to Limerick.\nThe Great Depression strikes Ireland even harder than it does the United States. The family first goes to Malachy's family home in Toome in County Antrim, where his parents tell them there is no work. He tries Dublin, hoping for a pension from his fighting days, but that does not materialise. They settle in Angela's original hometown of Limerick. Conditions for poor families are miserable. Malachy Sr finds it difficult to find work because of his Northern Irish accent and mannerisms, and the boys are mocked for their American accents.\nThe family is forced to rely on the dole and charity from the local Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which requires a humiliating application process. Angela and Malachy Sr argue about their conditions, Malachy spends the welfare money meant to feed the family, and he views Angela's asking for charity as degrading. The young family subsists on little more than bread and tea.\nWithin a year of the family's arrival, Oliver and Eugene also die. Oliver dies first, and then Eugene, a few months later, from grieving the loss of his twin and pneumonia. After each death, Angela is depressed, and the family moves to another house. Each move is a slide into worse circumstances. They settle in a slum house. The entire ground floor floods for half the year, requiring the family to live in the upstairs rooms, called Italy, until the rains cease, when they again have access to the ground floor, Ireland. Their house is next to the only lavatory on the street. The traffic of families dumping chamber pots in the lavatory is offensive. Two more baby brothers, Michael (born 1936), and Alphie (Alphonsus Joseph, b. 1940), are born in Limerick.\nFrankie grows up in Limerick as an intelligent boy, but always hungry. He makes unique observations about those around him. His strict Catholic upbringing in the local public school preys on him: Will he be going to hell? This plagues his mind as soon as he has been taught to make confession at age 7. He sees his father as three people: the man who rises early in the morning and talks with Frank; the man who tells stories to his sons in the evening; and the man who drinks too much, sings old songs, and asks his young sons to promise to die for Ireland.\nFrank gets typhoid fever at age 10, and he is taken to the hospital for months, where for the first time he has adequate food, warmth, clean sheets, and access to books with the time to read them. Frankie contracts chronic conjunctivitis the next year, which does not heal, requiring treatments.\nWhen the U.S. joins World War 2, many Limerick men, including Malachy Sr, find work at defence plants in Coventry, England, and they send money home. The first payment from Malachy Sr allows the family to buy food and pay the rent. Soon after, the money stops coming, and at age 11, Frank is the man of the house.\nWhen their mother is ill, Frank and his brothers steal leftover food from restaurants and grocery deliveries from doorsteps of wealthier homes until they are sent to stay with their aunt while their mother recuperates in the hospital.\nAfter a humorous few weeks of burning the second floor wall for the cooking fire, the family is evicted and homeless. At her mother's suggestion, Angela and her children move in with her bachelor cousin, Laman Griffin, who is a petty tyrant. Frank endures this treatment until the day after his schooling ends in June, and he is promised the loan of Laman's bicycle to join his friends, but Laman reneges on his promise. Added to this disappointment, Laman's deal to provide housing includes a sexual relationship with Angela. Frankie fights with Laman, and he is thrown out of the house. Shortly after, Malachy Jr leaves Laman Griffin's to join the British military as a bugle boy.\nFrankie moves in with his maternal uncle, a simple man who was \"dropped on his head as a child\" and lives alone in the house. Frank gets a job as a telegram delivery boy on his 14th birthday and enjoys his first wages. He meets many unexpected situations while delivering telegrams, including his first girlfriend, who dies of tuberculosis. He meets Mrs Finucane who buys clothes for people at a discount, and then they pay her back over time for the full price; she asks Frank to write threatening letters to encourage them to repay these loans. He tells no one about this job, which he has until she dies.\nA few months after he moves, the rest of the family follows him to the house. Frank now turns over the majority of his wages to his mother. He works for the post office until he is 16, and he finds a job with Eason's, a company that supplies magazines and newspapers to Limerick stores.\nOn his 16th birthday, Frank's uncle takes him to the pub to buy him his first beer. Frank gets drunk and heads home. When his mother shames him for drinking like his father, Frank hits her, accusing her of being a whore for Laman Griffin, and he is immediately ashamed of himself.\nShortly before he turns 19, Frank returns to Mrs Finucane’s home to find she has died. Frank takes some of the money from her purse and throws her ledger of debtors into the river to free the neighborhood of their debts. This freedom from the debt gives him enough money to sail to New York. Frank arrives in Poughkeepsie, New York where the ship docks, and he agrees with a ship's crew man that it is a great country.\n\n\n== Character list ==\nMcCourt family\n\nFrancis McCourt: The writer of the book and main character. Frank is a religious, determined, and intelligent Irish American who struggles to find happiness and success in the harsh community.\nMalachy McCourt: Frank's father and an alcoholic. Though his addiction almost ruins the family, Mr. McCourt manages to obtain his children's affection by telling Irish stories.\nAngela McCourt, née Sheehan: Frank's hardworking mother who puts her family first and holds high expectations for her children. She is also humorous and witty.\nMalachy (Jr.): Frank's younger and supposedly more attractive and charming brother.\nOliver: Frank's brother, twin to Eugene, who dies at an early age in Ireland.\nEugene: Frank's brother, who dies of pneumonia six months after Oliver, his twin.\nMargaret: Frank's only little sister, who dies in her sleep in the United States.\nMichael: Frank's brother.\nAlphonsus: Frank's youngest brother.\nAunt Aggie: Frank's childless aunt. She does not approve of Angela's husband or how Angela is raising and caring for her children, but is helpful and loyal nonetheless.\nUncle Pa Keating: Aunt Aggie's husband, who is especially fond of Eugene.\nUncle Pat Sheehan: Angela's brother, who was dropped on the head when he was young.\nGrandma: Angela's mother and Frank's grandmother, who sends Angela money to come to Ireland.\nOthers\n\nPaddy Clohessy: a poor boy in the same class as Frank, who considers Frank a friend after Frank shares with him a much-coveted raisin.\nBrendan \"Question\" Quigley, occasionally (not to mention, inconsistently) referred to as Brendan Kieley: another classmate of Frank's, who often gets into trouble because of his tendency to ask too many questions.\nFintan Slattery: a classmate of Frank's who invites Frank and Paddy over for lunch, but proceeds to eat all of it in front of them without offering them any. It is implied that he has homosexual tendencies.\nMikey Molloy: son of Nora Molloy, who is older than Frank, has seizures, and is the \"expert on girls' bodies and dirty things\".\nPatricia Madigan: a patient at the Fever Hospital who befriends Frank and tells him bits of poetry, notably \"The Highwayman\" by Alfred Noyes, but dies before she can tell him the rest of the poem.\nSeamus: the hospital janitor who helps Frank and Patricia communicate, and later recites poetry to Frank in the eye hospital.\nMr. Timoney: an old man who pays Frank to read books to him.\nDotty O’Neill: Frank's somewhat eccentric 4th class teacher who loves Euclid.\nMr. O’Dea: Frank's 5th class teacher and headmaster\nTheresa Carmody: a 17-year-old consumptive girl with whom Frank has a sexual relationship. Frank desperately worries about the fate of Theresa's soul, which he fears he is jeopardizing by having premarital sex with her.\nMickey Spellacy: a friend of Frank who, anticipating his sister's death, promises Frank he can come to the wake and eat some of the food.\nMrs. Brigid Finucane: Frank delivers a telegram to her, and then works for her by writing threatening letters to people who owe her money. Mrs. Finucane bought clothes for people at a discount, and they repaid her the full price in time. Frank tells no one that he is writing these letters, even when he hears his mother and various neighbors complaining about them.\nLaman Griffin: Angela's cousin, whom she is compelled to sleep with during the family's time living at his house.\n\n\n== Literary significance and reception ==\nMichiko Kakutani concluded her review in The New York Times of Angela's Ashes by writing \"The reader of this stunning memoir can only hope that Mr. McCourt will set down the story of his subsequent adventures in America in another book. Angela's Ashes is so good it deserves a sequel.\" McCourt \"has used the storytelling gifts he inherited from his father to write a book that redeems the pain of his early years with wit and compassion and grace.\" The book is compared \"with The Liars Club by Mary Karr and Andre Aciman's Out of Egypt as a classic modern memoir.\" McCourt writes without bitterness about his epic tale of woe, though \"there is plenty a less generous writer might well be judgmental about.\" The review is peppered with quotations from the book showing the author's style. Kakutani remarks that \"Writing in prose that's pictorial and tactile, lyrical but streetwise, Mr. McCourt does for the town of Limerick what the young Joyce did for Dublin: he conjures the place for us with such intimacy that we feel we've walked its streets and crawled its pubs.\" This review is strong in its analysis of the book as well-written and modern, comparable with great writers. The scope of the \"memoir is not just the story of his family's struggles, but the story of his own sentimental education: his discovery of poetry and girls, and his efforts to come to terms with God and death and faith. By 11, he's the chief breadwinner for the family. By 15, he's lost his first girlfriend to tuberculosis. By 19, he's saved enough money to make his escape to the States.\"\nIn its review, Kirkus Reviews has strong praise: \"An extraordinary work in every way. McCourt magically retrieves love, dignity, and humor from a childhood of hunger, loss and pain.\" This is the first book by McCourt. It is \"a powerful, exquisitely written debut, a recollection of the author's miserable childhood in the slums of Limerick, Ireland, during the Depression and World War II.\"\nNina King wrote in The Washington Post that \"This memoir is an instant classic of the genre -- all the more remarkable for being the 66-year-old McCourt's first book.\" She summarized her review by saying that \"Angela's Ashes confirms the worst old stereotypes about the Irish, portraying them as drunken, sentimental, bigoted, bloody-minded dreamers, repressed sexually and oppressed politically, nursing ancient grievances while their children (their far-too-many children) go hungry. ... at the same time that it transcends them through the sharpness and precision of McCourt's observation and the wit and beauty of his prose.\" \nReviewing the book at its publication in 1996, John Blades wrote in the Chicago Tribune that \"Like McCourt himself, Angela's Ashes is a bundle of contradictions, as uproarious as they are grievous, whether the young Frankie is pushing his baby brother around Limerick, dumping loose coal and turf into his pram; his \"pious, defeated\" mother is begging a sheep's head for their Christmas dinner; or his soused father is rousing the boys in the middle of the night to sing \"Kevin Barry\" and other patriotic Irish songs.\" The book event was held in at the Mercury Theater and the adjoining Chicago bar; the book is a debut for McCourt but he had \"been a familiar figure on local stages during the '80s. Billing themselves as \"A Couple of Blaguards,\" he and his younger brother, Malachy, re-enacted their Limerick boyhood in story, song and verse for audiences at the Royal George and other theaters.\" McCourt's book places \"McCourt's mother, Angela, [as] the nominal heroine of his memoir, eternally on the dole, pathetically trying to clothe and feed her sons. But it's the blackguard father, also named Malachy, who obsesses McCourt, and who commandeers center stage in his memoir, long after he's abandoned his wife and family.\" At the book event, McCourt notes that most of the reviews of his memoir call it \"lyrical and charming,\" but he says that \"what gives Irish writing its distinctive flavor is not the charming stuff but the darkness.\"\nIn a review of the book and its audio book version released in 1997, Gayle Sims wrote that it is the \"only book that I unequivocally recommend listening to instead of reading.\" She explains why the narration makes a better experience than reading on paper, as the author \"reads the narrative in his everyday dialect, yet he is able to give it the voice of a child. This works particularly well because Angela's Ashes is written from a child's unjudging perspective.\" Although the tough, challenging and sad events of his childhood might present a negative story to the reader or listener, \"The book is full of tears and laughter. McCourt is forgiving of his family's tragic life. When he reads, there is no rancor in his voice.\"\nWriting a review in 2020, Ashley Nelson stated \"This story is challenging to the emotions; it deals with many elements and situations that make people uncomfortable. However, it has you holding back laughter, as Frank McCourt has this magical ability to make light of being starving in the pouring rain walking through the streets of Limerick. This book has you feel love, loss, fear, hunger, and the will to overcome uncertainty.\" This book is a \"quintessential coming of age story viewed through the grimy, unyielding, and sometimes downright heartbreaking lens of poverty. It follows Frank McCourt as he comically explains the dire circumstances of his conception, birth, and life.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter traveling to America (where the book ends), McCourt worked at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City, where he remained until 1951. He was drafted during the Korean War to be stationed in Bavaria, Germany. After being discharged, he returned to New York and dabbled with several different jobs until he was accepted into New York University. After graduating in 1957 with a bachelor's degree in English, McCourt turned to teaching in New York schools. He then obtained his master's degree and traveled to Dublin in pursuit of his PhD, which he never completed.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAngela's Ashes won several awards, including the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, the 1996 National Book Critics Circle Award (Biography), and the 1997 Boeke Prize.\nFrank McCourt was elected Irish American of the Year in 1998.\n\n\n== Disputed memories ==\nMcCourt was accused of exaggerating his family's impoverished upbringing by many Limerick natives, including Richard Harris. McCourt's mother denied the accuracy of his stories shortly before her death in 1981, walking out of a stage performance by her two elder sons; Malachy's recollection is that she said it was \"all a pack of lies.\"\nLocal writer and filmmaker Gerry Hannan has compiled a list of 204 inaccuracies in Angela's Ashes; Hannan confronted McCourt on The Late Late Show in 1999. Hannan claimed that as McCourt was a member of the Boy Scouts, a middle-class pursuit the poor could not afford, and family photographs show the children and Angela as well-fed.\nAmerican journalist John Meyer visited Limerick and took the tour of the city sparked by publication of the book. He realized how much the city had changed since McCourt's childhood years, including destruction of the slum area where his family lived when Frank was in school.\nMcCourt described the book as \"a memoir, not an exact history\", and admitted to fabricating the story about Willie Harrold's sisters. Similarly, Alan Parker, who directed the film version, said that Angela's Ashes \"was a work of art which met Gore Vidal's definition of autobiography, being an 'impression' of a life, rather than a memoir.\"\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1999 a film version was released. It was co-written and directed by Alan Parker starring Joe Breen, Ciarán Owens, and Michael Legge, as the Young, Middle and Older Frank McCourt respectively and Emily Watson as McCourt's mother Angela, Robert Carlyle as the father.\nThe film begins when the McCourt family move back to Ireland after experiencing hardship in America. Many of the Street scenes were filmed in Cork, Ireland. The film soundtrack was composed and conducted by John Williams, and features songs by Billie Holiday and Sinéad O'Connor.\n\n\n=== Musical ===\nA stage musical adaptation of Angela's Ashes by Adam Howell (Music & Lyrics) and Paul Hurt (Book) received its world premiere at the Lime Tree Theatre, Limerick on July 6, 2017 with following performances at the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre, Dublin and the Grand Opera House, Belfast.  McCourt's wife, Ellen Frey McCourt, remarked about making a musical from that memoir, before it opened in Limerick, that \"The movie does not have the humour of the book, or that this musical has.” Moreover, she adds, “if you think about it, was Sweeney Todd a good example of a musical subject? Or Oliver!, or Annie? There’s a silver lining in each of these shows, and Angela's Ashes is really a story about a family triumphing over adversity.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nMisery lit\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHagan, Edward A. “Really an Alley Cat?

    "full_narrative": "'Tis is a memoir written by Frank McCourt of his time learning how to live in New York City. Published in 1999, it begins where McCourt ended Angela's Ashes, his Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of his impoverished childhood in Ireland and his return to America.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book begins as McCourt lands upriver from New York City, and quickly makes his way to New York City with an Irish-American priest on the ship. Friendless and clueless about American customs, he struggles to integrate himself into American blue-collar society, working at laboring jobs while spending his free time reading books. The New York City public library is a wonder to him, with its welcoming ways. He spends time there and checks out books from the start.\nHe is drafted into the US Army because of the Korean War; he is sent to Europe, and rises to the rank of corporal. During his time in southern Germany, he meets men from all over the U.S. When serving as company clerk, he delivers laundry to U.S. Army facilities at Dachau, a haunting experience, both for a Jewish soldier with him and for Frank, who heard all the news of World War II growing up in Limerick. Soldiers are always looking for women, trading their cigarette and coffee allotments for sex, even with refugees from WWII who are still not settled, which the Army disapproves of. Frank has a troubling encounter with a poor and hungry girl in a refugee camp. The people in the Army teach him a lot about American ways, so different from his upbringing in the lanes of Limerick. While in the Army in Germany, he gets two weeks leave to visit his family in Ireland, seeing his mother and youngest brothers Michael and Alphie in Limerick, and for one day, his father and paternal grandmother in Toome. He has been sending part of his Army wages to his mother, and she has gained a home with all the modern advantages of plumbing, a refrigerator and space for a garden in the Janesboro neighborhood; she does not move out of the slum house shared with her brother, where she was raised, until Frank arrives. His emotions while in Limerick are strongly mixed, between pride in his U.S. Army status, pleasure at the better life of his youngest brother who attends secondary school, and the hard memories of his own life there, the \"dark clouds\" in his mind.\nBecause he has a girlfriend, Emma, in New York City, he leaves the army at his earliest opportunity, being commended for his exceptional service as a clerk-typist by his superior officers.\nHe returns to New York City, where he breaks up with Emma, preferring to be single in New York, going out drinking with his pals. He attends New York University – despite never having graduated from high school. The G.I. Bill pays for university tuition, but he needs to work to pay for food and lodging. He takes jobs at warehouses at the docks, and then office jobs from a temporary job service, using his typing skills gained in the Army, continuing to meet many friends and interesting characters. He has some friends who are recent immigrants from Ireland as well as many friends born in the U.S. He falls in love with beautiful, middle-class American-born Alberta Small (nicknamed Mike), whom he meets at university.\nWhile never forgetting the songs of Ireland, he picks up a taste for American jazz music of the 1950s.\nHis brother Malachy is in New York; he opts to serve in the U.S. Air Force. Malachy and then younger brother Michael send part of their Air Force wages to their mother, so Frank has only himself to support while he finishes his courses at NYU.\nAfter graduating from NYU, he teaches English and social studies at McKee Vocational and Technical High School on Staten Island. He continues to drink with fellow teachers. After eight years there and some time as a substitute at a few colleges and high schools, he moves on to teaching English and creative writing at the prestigious Stuyvesant High School. At Stuyvesant, he revises his teaching style to end his reliance on textbooks and other teaching resources, to become an effective teacher of these bright students.\nHis brothers Malachy and Michael became well known in New York while Frank is teaching at McKee; Malachy has a bar, and a knack for attracting the rich and famous to it with his stories and easy laughter. Michael has similar talents. Frank's students ask him why he is not on television being interviewed, like his entertaining  brothers. When someone at Malachy's bar asks him when he will join Malachy and Michael in the bar, he says, when my brothers become teachers; showing his sense  of humor to the world, even when the dark clouds are on his mind. He flies to Ireland in the summer to see his mother and his youngest brother.\nHis mother comes to New York for Christmas of 1959, 10 years after Frank arrived, wanting to see her first grandchild, Malachy's daughter. Her youngest son Alphie is in America for the first time, 19 years old. They both stay in New York, the five of them together in New York, their dream for so long. Frank and Alberta are living together in Brooklyn, and they marry in the summer of 1961.\nIn 1971, Frank and his wife have a daughter, Margaret Ann, called Maggie. Frank names her after his sister who died in infancy, and his two grandmothers, who are described in Angela's Ashes. He takes care of her as an infant, spending as much time as he can with her as she grows up, sharing early mornings with her, as he had shared early mornings with his father. The family lives in a house in Brooklyn, which Frank and Alberta have fixed up in modern style, with  both of them working as teachers.\nFrank's father comes to New York once, in 1963, promising he is a new man, sober, but he arrives drunk on the ship that brings him. His three-week visit is long enough, and he returns to Northern Ireland. Eventually, Frank's relationship with his wife turns sour. Frank leaves when their daughter is 8 years old, an action he compares to that of his father leaving his family. Frank, however, keeps seeing his daughter as she grows up, and he always has a job.\nFrank's mother, Angela McCourt, is in increasingly poor health due to emphysema and dies in New York in 1981. For his daughter Maggie, her first experience of death is losing her grandmother. Frank had lost three young siblings, many school friends, and his own grandmother by his daughter's age.\nFrank's father, Malachy McCourt, Sr., dies in Northern Ireland in early 1985. Frank goes to Belfast with Alphie to bury their father. In August that year, Frank and his family went to Dublin and Limerick to scatter his mother's ashes. The book ends after Frank and his brothers scatter Angela's ashes over the graves of her family.\n\n\n== Book titles ==\n\"'Tis\" was the final and only word of the last chapter of Angela's Ashes, while 'Tis ends with the spreading of Angela McCourt's ashes in Ireland. Frank McCourt has remarked in several interviews, perhaps jokingly, that he originally intended for each book to have the other's title.\nFrank McCourt followed this book with another memoir, Teacher Man.\n\n\n== Character list ==\nFrank McCourt: The narrator and author of the book and an immigrant from Ireland, he has a deep love for literature. He marries Alberta after attending NYU.  He taught as a school teacher for the latter part of his life, despite many offers to work for higher pay in the auto industry and loading docks.\nAlberta Small: Also known as \"Mike\" during her college years. She and Frank meet in college during one of their classes together. Frank is in love with her from first meeting. She studies to become a teacher. She has trouble dealing with Frank's frequent drinking, but they eventually marry.\nTom Clifford: Frank's roommate and workmate after his time in the Army. Tom eventually leaves for Detroit to work in an auto factory, and urges Frank to join him. Frank declines, citing his desire to go to college as reason to stay in New York.\nMargaret Ann: Frank and Alberta's daughter, she is named after Frank's deceased baby-sister, Margaret.\nAndy Peters: A man Frank meets at NYU, who tells him of a good late shift job at a bank, typing loan application paperwork. Andy changes approvals for loans when he sees the day shift clearly erred in turning a person down. Andy is an NYU student in philosophy, age 31, who got a dishonorable discharge from the Army in World War II for dubious reason at age 19, which bars him from a normal job. Frank meets him again in the summer of 1959, where Andy is working at a restaurant, having given up on NYU, and still unable to get any job requiring an application form asking about his military discharge. Andy moves on a week later.\nHorace: A black Jamaican who befriends Frank at the warehouse where they work. Horace has a son in college in Canada; he encourages Frank to finish college, giving Frank the support his own father is not supplying.\n\n\n== Content and structure ==\nThe title of the book comes from the last sentence of the previous memoir, \"Tis\",  McCourt's answer to the rhetorical question, \"Isn't this a great country altogether?\" asked of him following his first night in America.\nThe story is told mainly in chronological order, while adding some incidents from his childhood, as they are the topics of essays for his college classes or stories he tells his students.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nL.S. Keep of Entertainment Weekly, described the memoir as a good successor of Angela's Ashes, concluding that \"this book has the same clairvoyant eye for quirks of class, character, and fate, and also a distinct picaresque quality. It's a quest for an America of wholesome Hollywood happiness that doesn't exist, and it's about the real America — rendered with comic affection — that McCourt discovers along the way. \" Similarly, Margo Hammond of the St. Petersburg Times found the memoir a good read, though McCourt was unable to provide a satisfactory narrative arc to the work. Commenting for the public radio station WKMS, Jacque Day called the memoir \"an exercise in humanity by a man with a rare gift for a story, and a brogue that sings on.\" A review of 'Tis: A Memoir, first published in 1999, in the Tampa Bay Times noted the difference in McCourt's clear insight into his parents' choices compared to his understanding of his own motives, said that \"McCourt's memoir actually is all the more human for this peculiar lack of reflection from an author that has seemed so uncannily perceptive in so many other areas. It reminds us once again that poverty doesn't necessarily ennoble people. We can only hope that the scars are few for those fortunate enough to survive it as successfully as Frank McCourt.\"\nTerry Golway opens his review with the statement that \"You have to be Irish to hate Frank McCourt.\" That reflects the candor, brutal candor, of Frank McCourt's writing on his life in New York city, following his first memoir on his life in Ireland. Golway compares McCourt's effect on Irish-Americans to that of Philip Roth on Jewish-Americans: \"Mr. McCourt is to the Irish of the late 1990's what Philip Roth was to Jewish Americans in the late 1960's.\" His review in The New York Observer goes on to state that \"'Tis is a remarkable and brutally candid exploration of one man's life in New York, and Mr. McCourt is as tough on himself as he is on the racists and drunks and lost souls he meets along the way.\"\nThe memoir has been criticized for ignoring McCourt's marriage to psychotherapist Cheryl Floyd, which followed his divorce from Alberta.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1998, Time named The Autobiography of Malcolm X as one of ten \"required reading\" nonfiction books. James Baldwin and Arnold Perl adapted the book as a screenplay, which later provided the source material for Spike Lee's 1992 film Malcolm X.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nPublished posthumously, The Autobiography of Malcolm  X is an account of the life of Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book describes Malcolm's childhood first in Omaha, Nebraska and then in the area around Lansing and Mason, Michigan, the death of his father under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital. X's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. Malcolm X was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before the book was finished. His co-author, the journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of Malcolm X's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the Autobiography's epilogue.\n\n\n== Genre ==\nThe Autobiography is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines Malcolm X's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. Literary critic Arnold Rampersad and Malcolm X biographer Michael Eric Dyson agree that the narrative of the Autobiography resembles the Augustinian approach to confessional narrative. Augustine's Confessions and The Autobiography of Malcolm X both relate the early hedonistic lives of their subjects, document deep philosophical change for spiritual reasons, and describe later disillusionment with religious groups their subjects had once revered. Haley and autobiographical scholar Albert E. Stone compare the narrative to the Icarus myth. Author Paul John Eakin and writer Alex Gillespie suggest that part of the Autobiography's rhetorical power comes from \"the vision of a man whose swiftly unfolding career had outstripped the possibilities of the traditional autobiography he had meant to write\", thus destroying \"the illusion of the finished and unified personality\".\nIn addition to functioning as a spiritual conversion narrative, The Autobiography of Malcolm X also reflects generic elements from other distinctly American literary forms, from the Puritan conversion narrative of Jonathan Edwards and the secular self-analyses of Benjamin Franklin, to the African American slave narratives. This aesthetic decision on the part of Malcolm X and Haley also has profound implications for the thematic content of the work, as the progressive movement between forms that is evidenced in the text reflects the personal progression of its subject. Considering this, the editors of the Norton Anthology of African American Literature assert that, \"Malcolm's Autobiography takes pains to interrogate the very models through which his persona achieves gradual self-understanding...his story's inner logic defines his life as a quest for an authentic mode of being, a quest that demands a constant openness to new ideas requiring fresh kinds of expression.\"\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nHaley coauthored The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and also performed the basic functions of a ghostwriter and biographical amanuensis, writing, compiling, and editing the Autobiography based on more than 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm X between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination. The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote an article about the Nation of Islam for Reader's Digest, and again when Haley interviewed Malcolm X for Playboy in 1962.\nIn 1963 the Doubleday publishing company asked Haley to write a book about the life of Malcolm X. American writer and literary critic Harold Bloom writes, \"When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ...\" Haley recalls, \"It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain.\" After Malcolm X was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the Autobiography, a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village. Bloom writes, \"Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military.\"\nWhen work on the Autobiography began in early 1963, Haley grew frustrated with Malcolm X's tendency to speak only about Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Haley reminded him that the book was supposed to be about Malcolm X, not Muhammad or the Nation of Islam, a comment which angered Malcolm X. Haley eventually shifted the focus of the interviews toward the life of his subject when he asked Malcolm X about his mother:\n\nI said, \"Mr. Malcolm, could you tell me something about your mother?\" And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, \"I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.\" And then he walked some more. And he said, \"I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.\" And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.\nThough Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern scholars tend to treat him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure in the composition of the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. Manning Marable considers the view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between Malcolm X and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.\nHaley's contribution to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss how it should be characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.\nHaley exercised discretion over content, guided Malcolm X in critical stylistic and rhetorical choices, and compiled the work. In the epilogue to the Autobiography, Haley describes an agreement he made with Malcolm X, who demanded that: \"Nothing can be in this book's manuscript that I didn't say and nothing can be left out that I want in it.\" As such, Haley wrote an addendum to the contract specifically referring to the book as an \"as told to\" account. In the agreement, Haley gained an \"important concession\": \"I asked for—and he gave—his permission that at the end of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review.\" These comments became the epilogue to the Autobiography, which Haley wrote after the death of his subject.\n\n\n=== Narrative presentation ===\nIn \"Malcolm X: The Art of Autobiography\", writer and professor John Edgar Wideman examines in detail the narrative landscapes found in biography. Wideman suggests that as a writer, Haley was attempting to satisfy \"multiple allegiances\": to his subject, to his publisher, to his \"editor's agenda\", and to himself. Haley was an important contributor to the Autobiography's popular appeal, writes Wideman. Wideman expounds upon the \"inevitable compromise\" of biographers, and argues that in order to allow readers to insert themselves into the broader socio-psychological narrative, neither coauthor's voice is as strong as it could have been. Wideman details some of the specific pitfalls Haley encountered while coauthoring the Autobiography:\n\nYou are serving many masters, and inevitably you are compromised. The man speaks and you listen but you do not take notes, the first compromise and perhaps betrayal. You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute for the reader your experience of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes ....\nIn the body of the Autobiography, Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is seemingly absent: \"Haley does so much with so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium\". Wideman argues that Haley wrote the body of the Autobiography in a manner of Malcolm X's choosing and the epilogue as an extension of the biography itself, his subject having given him carte blanche for the chapter. Haley's voice in the body of the book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by Malcolm X but seemingly written by no author. The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader to feel as though the voice of Malcolm X is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: \"Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told.\"\nIn \"Two Create One: The Act of Collaboration in Recent Black Autobiography: Ossie Guffy, Nate Shaw, and Malcolm X\", Stone argues that Haley played an \"essential role\" in \"recovering the historical identity\" of Malcolm X. Stone also reminds the reader that collaboration is a cooperative endeavor, requiring more than Haley's prose alone can provide, \"convincing and coherent\" as it may be:\n\nThough a writer's skill and imagination have combined words and voice into a more or less convincing and coherent narrative, the actual writer [Haley] has no large fund of memories to draw upon: the subject's [Malcolm X] memory and imagination are the original sources of the arranged story and have also come into play critically as the text takes final shape. Thus where material comes from, and what has been done to it are separable and of equal significance in collaborations.\nIn Stone's estimation, supported by Wideman, the source of autobiographical material and the efforts made to shape them into a workable narrative are distinct, and of equal value in a critical assessment of the collaboration that produced the Autobiography. While Haley's skills as writer have significant influence on the narrative's shape, Stone writes, they require a \"subject possessed of a powerful memory and imagination\" to produce a workable narrative.\n\n\n=== Collaboration between Malcolm X and Haley ===\nThe collaboration between Malcolm X and Haley took on many dimensions; editing, revising and composing the Autobiography was a power struggle between two men with sometimes competing ideas of the final shape for the book. Haley \"took pains to show how Malcolm dominated their relationship and tried to control the composition of the book\", writes Rampersad. Rampersad also writes that Haley was aware that memory is selective and that autobiographies are \"almost by definition projects in fiction\", and that it was his responsibility as biographer to select material based on his authorial discretion. The narrative shape crafted by Haley and Malcolm X is the result of a life account \"distorted and diminished\" by the \"process of selection\",  Rampersad suggests, yet the narrative's shape may in actuality be more revealing than the narrative itself. In the epilogue Haley describes the process used to edit the manuscript, giving specific examples of how Malcolm X controlled the language.\n\nWhile Haley ultimately deferred to Malcolm X's specific choice of words when composing the manuscript, Wideman writes, \"the nature of writing biography or autobiography ... means that Haley's promise to Malcolm, his intent to be a 'dispassionate chronicler', is a matter of disguising, not removing, his authorial presence.\" Haley played an important role in persuading Malcolm X not to re-edit the book as a polemic against Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam at a time when Haley already had most of the material needed to complete the book, and asserted his authorial agency when the Autobiography's \"fractured construction\", caused by Malcolm X's rift with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, \"overturned the design\" of the manuscript and created a narrative crisis. In the Autobiography's epilogue, Haley describes the incident:\n\nI sent Malcolm X some rough chapters to read. I was appalled when they were soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning Malcolm X, I reminded him of his previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. Malcolm X said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night Malcolm X telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.\n\nHaley's warning to avoid \"telegraphing to readers\" and his advice about \"building suspense and drama\" demonstrate his efforts to influence the narrative's content and assert his authorial agency while ultimately deferring final discretion to Malcolm X. In the above passage Haley asserts his authorial presence, reminding his subject that as a writer he has concerns about narrative direction and focus, but presenting himself in such a way as to give no doubt that he deferred final approval to his subject. In the words of Eakin, \"Because this complex vision of his existence is clearly not that of the early sections of the Autobiography, Alex Haley and Malcolm X were forced to confront the consequences of this discontinuity in perspective for the narrative, already a year old.\" Malcolm X, after giving the matter some thought, later accepted Haley's suggestion.\nWhile Marable argues that Malcolm X was his own best revisionist, he also points out that Haley's collaborative role in shaping the Autobiography was notable. Haley influenced the narrative's direction and tone while remaining faithful to his subject's syntax and diction. Marable writes that Haley worked \"hundreds of sentences into paragraphs\", and organized them into \"subject areas\". Author William L. Andrews writes:\n\n[T]he narrative evolved out of Haley's interviews with Malcolm, but Malcolm had read Haley's typescript, and had made interlineated notes and often stipulated substantive changes, at least in the earlier parts of the text. As the work progressed, however, according to Haley, Malcolm yielded more and more to the authority of his ghostwriter, partly because Haley never let Malcolm read the manuscript unless he was present to defend it, partly because in his last months Malcolm had less and less opportunity to reflect on the text of his life because he was so busy living it, and partly because Malcolm had eventually resigned himself to letting Haley's ideas about effective storytelling take precedence over his own desire to denounce straightaway those whom he had once revered.\n\nAndrews suggests that Haley's role expanded because the book's subject became less available to micro-manage the manuscript, and \"Malcolm had eventually resigned himself\" to allowing \"Haley's ideas about effective storytelling\" to shape the narrative.\nMarable studied the Autobiography manuscript \"raw materials\" archived by Haley's biographer, Anne Romaine, and described a critical element of the collaboration, Haley's writing tactic to capture the voice of his subject accurately, a disjoint system of data mining that included notes on scrap paper, in-depth interviews, and long \"free style\" discussions. Marable writes, \"Malcolm also had a habit of scribbling notes to himself as he spoke.\" Haley would secretly \"pocket these sketchy notes\" and reassemble them in a sub rosa attempt to integrate Malcolm X's \"subconscious reflections\" into the \"workable narrative\". This is an example of Haley asserting authorial agency during the writing of the Autobiography, indicating that their relationship was fraught with minor power struggles. Wideman and Rampersad agree with Marable's description of Haley's book-writing process.\nThe timing of the collaboration meant that Haley occupied an advantageous position to document the multiple conversion experiences of Malcolm X and his challenge was to form them, however incongruent, into a cohesive workable narrative. Dyson suggests that \"profound personal, intellectual, and ideological changes ... led him to order events of his life to support a mythology of metamorphosis and transformation\". Marable addresses the confounding factors of the publisher and Haley's authorial influence, passages that support the argument that while Malcolm X may have considered Haley a ghostwriter, he acted in actuality as a coauthor, at times without Malcolm X's direct knowledge or expressed consent:\n\nAlthough Malcolm X retained final approval of their hybrid text, he was not privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm X's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past Malcolm X,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of Malcolm X had begun well prior to his assassination.\nMarable says the resulting text was stylistically and ideologically distinct from what Marable believes Malcolm X would have written without Haley's influence, and it also differs from what may have actually been said in the interviews between Haley and Malcolm X.\n\n\n=== Myth-making ===\nIn Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X, Dyson criticizes historians and biographers of the time for re-purposing the Autobiography as a transcendent narrative by a \"mythological\" Malcolm X without being critical enough of the underlying ideas. Further, because much of the available biographical studies of Malcolm X have been written by white authors, Dyson suggests their ability to \"interpret black experience\" is suspect. The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Dyson says, reflects both Malcolm X's goal of narrating his life story for public consumption and Haley's political ideologies. Dyson writes, \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X ... has been criticized for avoiding or distorting certain facts. Indeed, the autobiography is as much a testament to Haley's ingenuity in shaping the manuscript as it is a record of Malcolm's attempt to tell his story.\"\n\nRampersad suggests that Haley understood autobiographies as \"almost fiction\". In \"The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's Malcolm and Malcolm's Malcolm\", Rampersad criticizes Perry's biography, Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America, and makes the general point that the writing of the Autobiography is part of the narrative of blackness in the 20th century and consequently should \"not be held utterly beyond inquiry\". To Rampersad, the Autobiography is about psychology, ideology, a conversion narrative, and the myth-making process. \"Malcolm inscribed in it the terms of his understanding of the form even as the unstable, even treacherous form concealed and distorted particular aspects of his quest. But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' about him is impossible to know.\" Rampersad suggests that since his 1965 assassination, Malcolm X has \"become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them.\" Further, Rampersad says, many admirers of Malcolm X perceive \"accomplished and admirable\" figures like Martin Luther King Jr., and W. E. B. Du Bois inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, \"while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero—his wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic\". Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of Malcolm X.\nAuthor Joe Wood writes:\n\n[T]he autobiography iconizes Malcolm twice, not once. Its second Malcolm—the El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz finale—is a mask with no distinct ideology, it is not particularly Islamic, not particularly nationalist, not particularly humanist. Like any well crafted icon or story, the mask is evidence of its subject's humanity, of Malcolm's strong human spirit. But both masks hide as much character as they show. The first mask served a nationalism Malcolm had rejected before the book was finished; the second is mostly empty and available.\nTo Eakin, a significant portion of the Autobiography involves Haley and Malcolm X shaping the fiction of the completed self. Stone writes that Haley's description of the Autobiography's composition makes clear that this fiction is \"especially misleading in the case of Malcolm X\"; both Haley and the Autobiography itself are \"out of phase\" with its subject's \"life and identity\". Dyson writes, \"[Louis] Lomax says that Malcolm became a 'lukewarm integrationist'. [Peter] Goldman suggests that Malcolm was 'improvising', that he embraced and discarded ideological options as he went along. [Albert] Cleage and [Oba] T'Shaka hold that he remained a revolutionary black nationalist. And [James Hal] Cone asserts that he became an internationalist with a humanist bent.\" Marable writes that Malcolm X was a \"committed internationalist\" and \"black nationalist\" at the end of his life, not an \"integrationist\", noting, \"what I find in my own research is greater continuity than discontinuity\".\n\nMarable, in \"Rediscovering Malcolm's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History\", critically analyzes the collaboration that produced the Autobiography. Marable argues autobiographical \"memoirs\" are \"inherently biased\", representing the subject as he would appear with certain facts privileged, others deliberately omitted. Autobiographical narratives self-censor, reorder event chronology, and alter names. According to Marable, \"nearly everyone writing about Malcolm X\" has failed to critically and objectively analyze and research the subject properly. Marable suggests that most historians have assumed that the Autobiography is veritable truth, devoid of any ideological influence or stylistic embellishment by Malcolm X or Haley. Further, Marable believes the \"most talented revisionist of Malcolm X, was Malcolm X\", who actively fashioned and reinvented his public image and verbiage so as to increase favor with diverse groups of people in various situations.\nHaley writes that during the last months of Malcolm X's life \"uncertainty and confusion\" about his views were widespread in Harlem, his base of operations. In an interview four days before his death Malcolm X said, \"I'm man enough to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible.\" Malcolm X had not yet formulated a cohesive Black ideology at the time of his assassination and, Dyson writes, was \"experiencing a radical shift\" in his core \"personal and political understandings\".\n\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\nEliot Fremont-Smith, reviewing The Autobiography of Malcolm X for The New York Times in 1965, described it as \"extraordinary\" and said it is a \"brilliant, painful, important book\". Two years later, historian John William Ward wrote that the book \"will surely become one of the classics in American autobiography\". Bayard Rustin argued the book suffered from a lack of critical analysis, which he attributed to Malcolm X's expectation that Haley be a \"chronicler, not an interpreter.\"  Newsweek also highlighted the limited insight and criticism in The Autobiography but praised it for power and poignance.  However, Truman Nelson in The Nation lauded the epilogue as revelatory and described Haley as a \"skillful amanuensis\". Variety called it a \"mesmerizing page-turner\" in 1992, and in 1998, Time named The Autobiography of Malcolm X one of ten \"required reading\" nonfiction books.\nThe Autobiography of Malcolm X has influenced generations of readers. In 1990, Charles Solomon writes in the Los Angeles Times, \"Unlike many '60s icons, The Autobiography of Malcolm X, with its double message of anger and love, remains an inspiring document.\" Cultural historian Howard Bruce Franklin describes it as \"one of the most influential books in late-twentieth-century American culture\", and the Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature credits Haley with shaping \"what has undoubtedly become the most influential twentieth-century African American autobiography\".\nConsidering the literary impact of Malcolm X's Autobiography, we may note the tremendous influence of the book, as well as its subject generally, on the development of the Black Arts Movement. Indeed, it was the day after Malcolm's assassination that the poet and playwright, Amiri Baraka, established the Black Arts Repertory Theater, which would serve to catalyze the aesthetic progression of the movement. Writers and thinkers associated with the Black Arts movement found in the Autobiography an aesthetic embodiment of his profoundly influential qualities, namely, \"the vibrancy of his public voice, the clarity of his analyses of oppression's hidden history and inner logic, the fearlessness of his opposition to white supremacy, and the unconstrained ardor of his advocacy for revolution 'by any means necessary.'\"\nbell hooks writes \"When I was a young college student in the early seventies, the book I read which revolutionized my thinking about race and politics was The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\" David Bradley adds:\n\nShe [hooks] is not alone. Ask any middle-aged socially conscious intellectual to list the books that influenced his or her youthful thinking, and he or she will most likely mention The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Some will do more than mention it. Some will say that ... they picked it up—by accident, or maybe by assignment, or because a friend pressed it on them—and that they approached the reading of it without great expectations, but somehow that book ... took hold of them. Got inside them. Altered their vision, their outlook, their insight. Changed their lives.\nMax Elbaum concurs, writing that \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X was without question the single most widely read and influential book among young people of all racial backgrounds who went to their first demonstration sometime between 1965 and 1968.\"\nAt the end of his tenure as the first African-American U.S. Attorney General, Eric Holder selected The Autobiography of Malcolm X when asked what book he would recommend to a young person coming to Washington, D.C.\n\n\n=== Publication and sales ===\n\nDoubleday had contracted to publish The Autobiography of Malcolm X and paid a $30,000 advance to Malcolm X and Haley in 1963. In March 1965, three weeks after Malcolm X's assassination, Nelson Doubleday Jr., canceled its contract out of fear for the safety of his employees. Grove Press then published the book later that year. Since then The Autobiography of Malcolm X has sold millions of copies, Marable described Doubleday's choice as the \"most disastrous decision in corporate publishing history\".\nThe Autobiography of Malcolm X has sold well since its 1965 publication. According to The New York Times, the paperback edition sold 400,000 copies in 1967 and 800,000 copies the following year. The Autobiography entered its 18th printing by 1970. The New York Times reported that six million copies of the book had been sold by 1977. The book experienced increased readership and returned to the best-seller list in the 1990s, helped in part by the publicity surrounding Spike Lee's 1992 film Malcolm X. Between 1989 and 1992, sales of the book increased by 300%.\nIn 2020, Laurence Fishburne narrated it in what was Audible's first-ever unabridged audiobook recording.\n\n\n=== Screenplay adaptations ===\nIn 1968 film producer Marvin Worth hired novelist James Baldwin to write a screenplay based on The Autobiography of Malcolm X; Baldwin was joined by screenwriter Arnold Perl, who died in 1971 before the screenplay could be finished. Baldwin developed his work on the screenplay into the book One Day, When I Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\", published in 1972. Other authors who attempted to draft screenplays include playwright David Mamet, novelist David Bradley, author Charles Fuller, and screenwriter Calder Willingham. Director Spike Lee revised the Baldwin-Perl script for his 1992 film Malcolm X.\n\n\n=== Missing chapters ===\nIn 1992, attorney Gregory Reed bought the original manuscripts of The Autobiography of Malcolm X for $100,000 at the sale of the Haley Estate. The manuscripts included three \"missing chapters\", titled \"The Negro\", \"The End of Christianity\", and \"Twenty Million Black Muslims\", that were omitted from the original text. In a 1964 letter to his publisher, Haley had described these chapters as, \"the most impact [sic] material of the book, some of it rather lava-like\". Marable writes that the missing chapters were \"dictated and written\" during Malcolm X's final months in the Nation of Islam. In them, Marable says, Malcolm X proposed the establishment of a union of African American civic and political organizations. Marable wonders whether this project might have led some within the Nation of Islam and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to try to silence Malcolm X.\nIn July 2018, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture acquired one of the \"missing chapters\", \"The Negro\", at auction for $7,000.\n\n\n=== Editions ===\nThe book has been published in more than 45 editions and in many languages, including Arabic, German, French, and Indonesian.

However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBefore writing I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings at the age of forty, Maya Angelou had a long and varied career, holding jobs such as a composer, singer, actor, civil rights worker, journalist, and educator. In the late 1950s, she joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met a number of important African-American authors, including her friend and mentor James Baldwin. After hearing civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. speak for the first time in 1960, she was inspired to join the Civil Rights Movement. She organized several benefits for him, and he named her Northern Coordinator of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She worked for several years in Ghana, West Africa, as a journalist, actress, and educator. She was invited back to the US by Malcolm X to work for him shortly before his assassination in 1965. In 1968, King asked her to organize a march, but he too was assassinated on April 4, which was also her birthday. For many years, Angelou responded to King's murder by not celebrating her birthday, instead choosing to meet with, call, or send flowers to his widow, Coretta Scott King.Angelou was deeply depressed in the months following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist Jules Feiffer and his wife Judy in late 1968. The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou's stories impressed Judy Feiffer. The next day Judy Feiffer called Robert Loomis at Random House, who became Angelou's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011, and \"told him that he ought to get this woman to write a book\". At first, Angelou refused, since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright, and was in the middle of writing a series for PBS television station WNET. According to Angelou, Baldwin had a \"covert hand\" in getting her to write the book, who advised Loomis to use \"a little reverse psychology\"; Angelou later reported that Loomis told her: \"It's just as well, because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible\". Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing Caged Bird. After \"closeting herself\" in London, it took her two years to write it. She shared the manuscript with her friend, writer Jessica Mitford, before submitting it for publication.\nAngelou subsequently wrote six additional autobiographies, covering a variety of her young adult experiences. They are distinct in style and narration, but unified in their themes, and stretch from Arkansas to Africa, and back to the U.S., from the beginnings of World War II to King's assassination. Like Caged Bird, the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology. Later books in the series include Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas (1976), The Heart of a Woman (1981), All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986), A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), and Mom & Me & Mom (2013, at the age of 85). Critics have often judged Angelou's later autobiographies \"in light of the first\", and Caged Bird generally receives the highest praise.\nBeginning with Caged Bird, Angelou used the same \"writing ritual\" for many years. She would get up at 5 am and check into a hotel room, where the staff were instructed to remove pictures from the walls. She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. She averaged 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. Critic Mary Jane Lupton states that this ritual indicated \"a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time\". Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to \"enchant\" herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to \"relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang\". She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to \"tell the human truth\" about her life. Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, \"It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!\" She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in \"telling the truth\". Angelou told scholar Joanne M. Braxton that she tried to \"suspend herself from the present\" while writing her autobiographies and put herself into the time wrote about, despite understanding that \"I might be trapped in that time\", a process she called \"frightening\". According to Myra K. McMurray, when Angelou was often asked how she escaped from her painful past, she would respond, \"How the hell do you know I did escape?\" McMurray states that Caged Bird is not \"an exorcism of or escape from the past\", but that it was \"a transmutation of that past\", adding, \"The almost novelistic clarity of Caged Bird results from the artistic tension between Angelou's recollected self and her authorial consciousness\".\n\n\n=== Title ===\nWhen selecting a title, Angelou turned to Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African American poet whose works she had admired for years. Jazz vocalist and civil rights activist Abbey Lincoln suggested the title. According to Lyman B. Hagen, the title pulls Angelou's readers into the book while reminding them that it is possible to both lose control of one's life and to have one's freedom taken from them. Angelou has credited Dunbar, along with Shakespeare, with forming her \"writing ambition\". According to Mary Jane Lupton, the caged bird in the title symbolizes a chained slave and appears frequently in Angelou's writings. Lupton also discusses Angelou's use of the word \"sings\", which she says critics have tended to downplay. The word creates an upward mood and \"suggests the survival of African Americans through the spiritual\". Although singing is more developed in Angelou's later books, she hints at the \"possibilities of joyful song\" in Caged Bird. Finally, also according to Lupton, the cage is a symbol of the restraint of not only the Black body, but of the female Black body. The cage is also a metaphor for the roles that force the bird to deny its identity and reject interrelationships with others, not just for the child Maya, but for almost everyone in her community.\n\nThe title of the book comes from the third stanza of Dunbar's poem \"Sympathy\":\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\nI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings follows Marguerite's (called \"My\" or \"Maya\" by her brother) life from the age of three to seventeen and the struggles she faces—particularly with racism and self-affirmation—in the Southern United States. Abandoned by their parents, Maya and her older brother Bailey are sent to live with their paternal grandmother (Momma) and disabled uncle (Uncle Willie) in Stamps, Arkansas. Maya and Bailey are haunted by their parents' abandonment throughout the book—they travel alone and are labeled like baggage.\n\nMany of the problems Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors and the subliminal awareness of race relations weaved in society. Although Momma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store at the heart of Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town, in an \"almost ritual insult\", hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these \"powhitetrash\" girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident which leaves Maya, watching from a distance, indignant and furious. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from Ku Klux Klan raiders, where he moans and groans under the potatoes throughout the night. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth-grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the Depression. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of Joe Louis's championship fight, but generally, they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.\nA turning point in the book occurs when Maya and Bailey's father unexpectedly appears in Stamps. He takes the two children with him when he departs, but leaves them with their mother in St. Louis. Eight-year-old Maya is sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, 'Mr. Freeman'. He is found guilty during the trial, but escapes jail time and gets murdered, presumably by Maya's uncles. Maya feels guilty and withdraws from everyone but her brother. Even after returning to Stamps, Maya remains reclusive and nearly mute until she meets Mrs. Bertha Flowers, \"the aristocrat of Black Stamps,\" who encourages her through books to regain her voice. This coaxes Maya out of her shell.\nLater, Momma decides to send her grandchildren to their mother in San Francisco, California, to protect them from the dangers of racism in Stamps. Maya attends George Washington High School and studies dance and drama on a scholarship at the California Labor School. Before graduating, she becomes the first Black female cable car conductor in San Francisco. While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer and has some experiences pivotal to her development. She drives a car for the first time when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico. She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father's girlfriend.\nDuring Maya's final year of high school, she worries that she might be a lesbian (which she confuses due to her sexual inexperience with the belief that lesbians are also hermaphrodites).  She ultimately initiates sexual intercourse with a teenage boy. She becomes pregnant, which, on the advice of her brother, she hides from her family until her eighth month of pregnancy in order to graduate from high school. Maya gives birth to her son at the end of the book.\n\n\n== Style and genre ==\nAngelou's prose works, while presenting a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form, can be placed in the long tradition of African-American autobiography. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development, however, often lead reviewers to categorize her books, including I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, as autobiographical fiction. Other critics, like Mary Jane Lupton, insist that Angelou's books should be categorized as autobiographies because they conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. In a 1983 interview with African-American literature critic Claudia Tate, Angelou calls her books autobiographies. Dolly McPherson states that Angelou's work demonstrates how a writer can use the autobiography to define her quest for human individuality, identify her struggle with \"the general condition of Black Americans\", and claim a representative role not only for Black Americans, but for \"the idea of America\". McPherson goes on to say that \"through a study of her work, one gains a closer access to American cultural history\".\nAs Lupton states, what makes Angelou's autobiographies different than more conventional autobiographies is her \"denial of closure\". Lupton says that no other serial autobiography places the mother/child theme in the center of the conflict, which made it important to the book's narrative. Lupton calls the narrative style in Caged Bird \"rich, humorous, intense, engaging\". The language Angelou uses can be frightening and her dialogue in the book, which is sharp and direct, conveys her characters' distinctive language and both reflects the language of her literary models and draws on the Southern speech patterns of her characters. Her use of metaphor places Angelou \"within the stylistic tradition of black protest literature\". She also uses precision to describe objects or places and her observations are sensual. As Lupton puts it, \"Her writing resembles a series of photographs or fragments of music: snapshots taken from many angles, notes played from a variety of instruments\". McPherson agrees, stating that in her autobiographies, Angelou \"uses the narrative gifts of an accomplished writer\". Braxton compares Angelou's style to that of Zora Neale Hurston and Era Bell Thompson, stating that Angelou also uses \"rhythmic language, lyrically suspended moments of consciousness, and detailed portraiture\". Braxton, due to Angelou's use of humor and folklore, also calls her a \"tale-teller par excellence.\" Harold Bloom, who does not think as highly of Angelou's poetry and does not find her subsequent autobiographies as compelling as her first, compares the tone in Caged Bird with the tone Rudyard Kipling uses in Kim, stating that Angelou \"provides us with a voice that we encounter very infrequently, whether in life or in literature\". According to Susan Gilbert, however, while Angelou records African American cadences and speech patterns, she does not limit herself \"to the tongues of black Arkansas or ghetto streets\". For example, Angelou describes the codeswitching that many in her community engage in; as Gilbert also says, the language Angelou uses \"moves between a strong, colloquial simplicity and a sometimes over-blown literary mannerism\".\n\nAt first, Angelou intended to return to poetry and play-writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies, but as she stated in an interview in 1989, she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and so that she could \"change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century\", adding that \"I think I am the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression\". McPherson agrees, stating in 1990 that no other American writer had chosen to make their \"major literary and cultural contribution so predominately in autobiographical form\". As Angelou told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, \"Autobiography is awfully seductive; it's wonderful\". She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of \"speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'\". As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. Angelou, throughout her series of autobiographies, also seeks to describe the personal, cultural, social, and historical influences that shaped her life and identity. Her experiences, as described in her books, \"represent stages of her spiritual growth and awareness\". As McPherson puts it, Angelou's autobiographies \"creates a unique place within Black autobiographical tradition\" and reveal \"important insights into Black traditions and culture\". Unlike other Black autobiographers like Anne Moody in Coming of Age in Mississippi, however, Angelou is less concerned with her book's place or setting, and instead focuses on her growing awareness of her environment.\nJoanne Braxton sees Caged Bird as \"the fully developed black female autobiographical form that began to emerge in the 1940s and 1950s\". Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe states that Caged Bird was written during an important period for African American literature, when there was an influx of prose writings by African American women. The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women: a celebration of Black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition. Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female from the South, at some points a child, and other points a mother. As Gilbert puts it, \"the reader of the book must deal throughout the dual perspective of the child, growing to consciousness of herself and the limits of her world, and the author, experienced, confident, and didactic\". Braxton states that Caged Bird has two points of view, the child and the mature narrator/artist; while the child's point of view governs Angelou's \"principle of selection\", the tone of the adult narrator is personal and compelled to explore aspects of her coming of age. Keneth Kinnamon states that like other Black female writers and unlike many male writers, Angelou was concerned with themes such as community, sexism, sexual exploitation, and relationships with family friends.\n\nGeorge E. Kent states that due to \"its special stance toward the self, the community, and the universe\", Caged Bird has a unique place within Black autobiography. McPherson says about Angelou: \"I know of no other autobiographer in American letters who celebrates and sings her life with as much verve and display of vulnerability\", adding that Angelou has demonstrated how the genre of the autobiography \"can be transformed into a strong evocation of the human spirit\". Writer Hilton Als calls Angelou one of the \"pioneers of self-exposure\", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, Angelou was worried about her readers' reactions to her disclosure in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, that she was a prostitute. She went through with it, anyway, after her husband Paul Du Feu advised her to be honest about it.\nAngelou has recognized that there are fictional aspects to her books, and that she tends to \"diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth\". Angelou discussed her writing process with Plimpton, and when asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she admitted that she had. She stated, \"Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about\". Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen states, \"One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work\", adding that Angelou \"fictionalizes, to enhance interest\". For example, Angelou uses the first-person narrative voice customary with autobiographies, told from the perspective, as Lupton puts it, of a child that is \"artfully recreated by an adult narrator\", although at times the book sounds more like fiction than autobiography. Harold Bloom says that, \"like all autobiographies, [Caged Bird] has fictive elements, but whatever they may be, they evidently work to the book's engaging artfulness\". Angelou identifies with slavery, verifying its power in her life and works, but Black womanhood and truth, themes found throughout the history of Black autobiography, is transformed by the period she describes. As Lupton puts it, \"In Caged Bird, for example, she records a life story begun in fear of crosses burning in the night, a life that is directly affected by the brutal remnants of slavery\". Lupton states that Angelou presents material not found in other autobiographies, written by both Black and white writers, because she addresses topics from the perspective of an African American woman. Lupton also compares Caged Bird and the next four volumes to prison narratives, although through her use of the caged bird symbol, her prison is symbolic rather than literal.\nCaged Bird has been called a bildungsroman; for example, Lupton compares it to other bildungsromans like George Eliot's novel The Mill on the Floss. According to Lupton, Caged Bird and The Mill on the Floss share the following similarities: a focus on young strong-willed heroines who have solid relationships with their brothers; an examination of the role of literature in life; and an emphasis on the importance of family and community life. Angelou uses two distinct voices, the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book, whom Angelou calls \"the Maya character\". Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and the Maya character is \"damned difficult\", but \"very necessary\". Scholar Liliane Arensberg, in her discussion about the theme of death in Caged Bird, suggests that Angelou \"retaliates for the tongue-tied child's helpless pain\" by using her adult self's irony and wit. As Lupton says, Maya \"fills readers' imaginations as have very few similar characters in American autobiography\" as she evolves from child to woman.\n\n\n== Form ==\nWhen Angelou wrote I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings at the end of the 1960s,  one of the necessary and accepted features of literature, according to critic Pierre A. Walker, was thematic unity. One of Angelou's goals was to create a book that satisfied this criterion, in order to achieve her political purposes, which were to demonstrate how to resist racism in America. The structure of the text, which resembles a series of short stories, is not chronological but is arranged according to themes. Walker, in his 1993 article about Caged Bird, \"Racial Protest, Identity, Words, and Form\", focuses on the book's structure, and describes how it supports her presentation of racism. Walker states that critics had neglected analyzing its structure, choosing to focus instead on its themes, which he feels neglects the political nature of the book. He states, \"One serves Angelou and Caged Bird better by emphasizing how form and political content work together\". Angelou structures her book so that it presents a series of lessons about how to resist racism and oppression. Maya's growth in resisting racism unifies the book thematically, something that \"stands in contrast to the otherwise episodic quality of the narrative\". The way in which Angelou constructs, arranges, and organizes her vignettes often undermine the chronology of her childhood by \"juxtaposing the events of one chapter with the events of preceding and following ones so that they too comment on each other\". As Dolly McPherson points out, Angelou does not record every experience, but instead selects, through a series of episodic chapters, \"valuable, life-determining truths about the world, about her community, and about herself\". Lupton points out that Caged Bird's form develops from the characters' interaction with each other, not through the development of dramatic actions. According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, unlike Angelou's poetry and despite the nonchronological structure of the book, which O'Neale calls \"skillfully controlled\", Angelou's prose \"follows classic technique in nonpoetic Western forms\". \n\nThe incident with the \"powhitetrash\" girls in Caged Bird takes place in chapter 5, when Maya was ten years old, well before Angelou's recounting of her rape in chapter 12, which occurred when Maya was 8. Walker explains that Angelou's purpose in placing the vignettes in this way is that it followed her thematic structure. Angelou's editor, Robert Loomis, agrees, stating that Angelou could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader. Hagen sees Angelou's structure somewhat differently, focusing on Maya's journey \"to establish a worthwhile self-concept\", and states that she structures the book into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, which occur both geographically and psychologically. Hagen notes that she does not begin Caged Bird chronologically, with Maya and Bailey's arrival in Stamps. Rather, she begins it later much later, with an embarrassing experience during an Easter service at church, an incident that demonstrates Maya's diminished sense of self, insecurity, and lack of status. George E. Kent divides Caged Bird into two \"areas of black life\": the religious-folk tradition, as represented through Maya's grandmother, and the blues-street tradition, as represented through her mother. Kent states that the first impact of the blues-street tradition on Maya and her brother is instability, when their mother ships the children to Stamps. Kent goes on to say that Angelou balances the qualities of both traditions, adding that \"a good deal of the book's universality derives from black life's traditions seeming to mirror, with extraordinary intensity, the root uncertainty in the universe\". \nSidonie Ann Smith states that Angelou starts the book with the Easter service incident because it \"defines the strategy of the narrative\". Smith also states that Angelou follows the convention in Black American autobiography, especially slave narratives, which recreates the environment of enslavement and oppression at the beginning, before describing how the protagonist escapes from it. Hagen explains that Angelou's purpose is to demonstrate Maya's journey from insecurity to her feelings of worth gained by becoming a mother at the end of the book. Even though the book begins with the Easter service, Angelou begins her \"autobiographical journey\" in Caged Bird with Maya and Bailey's train ride from California to Arkansas and continues in a triangular movement between Stamps, St. Louis, and California; according to Lupton, the reader, by following Maya's journeys, \"can get a solid sense of how structure operates within an autobiographical text\". McPherson states that Angelou opens Caged Bird with the Easter poem, which she evaluates in light of the book's plot and themes, because it emphasizes its significance in her life, describes her rootlessness, and \"is also a blues metaphor that foreshadows a cyclical pattern of renewal, rebirth, change in consciousness, and the circuitous journey of recovered innocence\". \n\n\n== Themes ==\n\n\n=== Identity ===\n\nIn the course of Caged Bird, Maya, who has been described as \"a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America\", goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity. Feminist scholar Maria Lauret states that the \"formation of female cultural identity\" is woven into the book's narrative, setting Maya up as \"a role model for Black women\". Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's \"identity theme\" and a major motif in Angelou's narrative. McPherson states that the heart of Caged Bird, which she calls Angelou's \"singular traditional focus\" is \"the growth of the individual from innocence to knowledge\". Sidonie Ann Smith, using the opening incident at church, connects Maya's appearance with the imprisonment and displacement imposed on her by the white society around her. Smith goes on to say that the pain of Maya's displacement is intensified by her awareness of the displacement, a personal displacement that is amplified by \"the ambience of displacement within the larger black community\". Maya's displacement and \"diminished self of self\" is reflected in her community's diminished self image. Smith also connects Maya's rape with her displacement, stating that Mr. Freeman took advantage of Maya's feelings of abandonment, self-loathing, and rejection. Maya is freed from her further displacement by Mrs. Flowers, who accepted Maya for who she was and \"allows her to experience the incipient power of her own self-worth\". Braxton states that Angelou's \"celebration of self\" is nurtured and developed by Black women—Momma, Mrs. Flowers, and even Maya's mother, Vivian. Both Momma and Vivian are different representations of \"the Jungian archetype of the Great Mother, protecting, nurturing, sheltering\". \n\nAfter Momma sends the children to their mother in California to protect them from the racism in Stamps, Maya learns from Vivian increased self-reliance; Braxton adds that Maya  \"grows out of the passive stage, asserting herself through action, and forging an identity\". Maya's earlier rebellion against Mrs. Cullinan, her racist white employer, is another way she preserves her individual and affirms her self-worth. Smith connects this incident with Maya's grandmother's decision to send Maya and Bailey to their mother in San Francisco, where Maya finally feels at home; as Smith puts it, \"She could feel in place in an environment where everyone and everything seemed out-of-place\". This was solidified in her experiences in Mexico and San Diego with her father, her short period of homelessness, and her pregnancy and birth of her son. The book ends in this way: \"The black American girl child has succeeded in freeing herself from the natural and social bars imprisoning her in the cage of her own diminished self-image by assuming control of her life and fully accepting her black womanhood\". Angelou told a interviewer that she did not set out, while writing Caged Bird, thinking out her own life or identity, but that she was \"thinking about a particular time in which I lived and the influence of that time on a number of people...I used the central figure—myself—as a focus to show how one person can make it through those times\". Maya's unsettled life in Caged Bird suggests her sense of self \"as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications\". Angelou begins to describe her changing identity in the book's early pages describing the Easter church service, when Maya painfully realizes that her fantasy of becoming white will never happen. As Dolly McPherson states, the scene graphically re-creates \"the dynamics of many young black girls' disillusionment and imprisonment in American society\", which gives the message to Maya and girls like her that physical beauty is defined in terms of whiteness. Arensberg states that Maya's displacement, or rootlessness, as well as her geographic movements and temporary residences throughout the book, are formative aspects of Maya's identity. It also helps her develop \"a stoic flexibility\" that becomes a way for her to both protect herself against and deal with the world around her. According to Arensberg, the flexibility is \"both a blessing and a curse: it enables her to adapt to various and changing environments, but it also keeps her forever threatened with loss or breakdown of her identity\".\nMaya fantasizes that she is white because she feels unloved, especially by her parents; both she and her brother deal with their abandonment and rejection by pretending that their mother was dead. McPherson also states that Angelou's statement in Caged Bird, \"If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat. It is an unnecessary insult\" characterize important parts of Angelou's life and \"provide wide-ranging, significant themes\" of the book. Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, stating that the statement contains the \"pervading themes\" in Caged Bird. McPherson states that unlike Christ, whose death and resurrection was being celebrated, it was impossible for Maya to be \"born into another life where she will be white and perfect and wonderful\", although Angelou creatively uses Christian mythology and theology to present the Biblical themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth in the book and \"skillfully re-creates the psychic, intellectual, and emotional patterns that identify her individual consciousness and experience\". Maya's childhood is shaped by her religiously devout grandmother, who although was not emotionally demonstrative, Maya knew that she was loved by her, which strengthened Maya as she grew and developed into childhood and early adolescence. As Angelou wrote in Caged Bird, \"a deep-brooding love hung over everything [Momma] touched\". Liliane Arensberg finds it significant that the first vignette Angelou presents in Caged Bird is her embarrassing incident at the Easter Sunday church service; even though the incident is out of order chronologically, Angelou considers it \"an epiphanic moment of her youth\" because it presents Maya's identity as a young child, her blackness and her outcast status. Angelou compares the repurposed dress Maya wore to the crepe paper at the back of a hearse, which represented Maya's body and the death of her fantasy about whiteness. As Arensberg states, Maya is forced to acknowledge her blackness and the \"malevolent force beyond her control that dictates her personal and racial identity\".\nAs Lauret indicates, Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Up until this time, Black women were not depicted realistically in African American fiction and autobiography, meaning that Angelou was one of the first Black autobiographers to present, as Cudjoe put it, \"a powerful and authentic signification of womanhood in her quest for understanding and love rather than for bitterness and despair\". Lauret sees a connection between Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret calls \"fictions of subjectivity\" and \"feminist first-person narratives\", and fictional first-person narratives (such as The Women's Room by Marilyn French and The Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing) written during the same period. As French and Lessing do in their novels, Angelou employs the narrator as protagonist and depends upon \"the illusion of presence in their mode of signification\". Maya is \"the forgotten child\", and must come to terms with \"the unimaginable reality\" of being unloved and unwanted; she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced; for example, her belief in her own ugliness was \"absolute\". \nAngelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities throughout her books to illustrate how oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in Caged Bird, Angelou demonstrates the \"racist habit\" of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her \"Mary\". Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the \"hellish horror of being 'called out of [one's] name'\". Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image. Cudjoe, who calls the incident \"poignant\", states the renaming denies Maya of her individuality, although Maya's response shocks Mrs. Cullinan into \"(re)cognition of her personhood\". King, in her discussion of the discourse production of poetic names in African American literature and its gendered difference, states that Angelou uses what King calls \"name fragmentation\" in this vignette. It also demonstrates \"the subversive complexities and resistive nature of black names' deep talk when confronted with racist oppression\", which is the point of the vignette. Angelou uses the conflicts of renaming to demonstrate that resistance to the practice and to communicate a confrontation of linguistic control, or as King puts it, \"a battle for dominion and control over the naming process\". The renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. As King puts it, the renaming \"stresses the violent effects of being renamed through the contaminating sieve of racism\".\nAnother incident in the book that solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time. Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally \"in control of her fate\".This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend. These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth. Her experience of homelessness also teaches her that \"outside the barriers of race, all men and women are the same\" and confirms her commitment to her personal growth. McPherson connects Maya's experiences while visiting her father with her determination and accomplishment of becoming the first streetcar conductor in San Francisco several months later.\nScholar Mary Burgher believes that female Black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African American mothers as \"breeder[s] and matriarch[s]\", and have presented them as having \"a creative and personally fulfilling role\". Lupton believes that Angelou's plot construction and character development were influenced by the same mother/child motif as is found in the work of Harlem Renaissance poet Jessie Fauset. For the first five years of her life, Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother is dead. Maya's feelings for and relationship with her mother, whom she blames for her abandonment, express themselves in ambivalence and \"repressed violent aggression\". For example, Maya and her brother destroy the first Christmas gifts sent to them by their mother. Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey. McPherson believes that family, or as she calls it, \"kinship concerns\", is an important theme in Caged Bird, which due to the siblings' early displacement, begins with a preoccupation with the nuclear family, but evolves into a dependence upon the extended family. Maya's conflict about her mother is not resolved until the end of the book, when Maya becomes a mother herself, and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed. The two main maternal influences on Maya's life change as well; Vivian becomes a more active participant, while Momma becomes less effective as Maya. As she becomes a mother herself, Maya moves from childhood to adulthood. Braxton adds that Maya does more than move from semi-orphanhood to motherhood; she also grows through various stages of self-awareness. McPherson states that as the book ends, Maya is no longer a displaced child; as a new mother, she takes control of her life and fully accepts her womanhood. As Susan Gilbert puts it, unlike at the beginning of the book, \"the writer neither wishes to be white nor fears for her black son\". Braxton adds that Maya's entry into motherhood is an assertion of her identity as both a mother and a daughter, \"as well as her relation to the maternal archetype\". The birth of Maya's son opened up new avenues of identity, not only for herself, but for her grandmother and mother as well.\n\n\n=== Racism ===\nJoanne M. Braxton calls Caged Bird \"perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying autobiography written in the years immediately following the Civil Rights era\". Pierre A. Walker expresses a similar sentiment, and places it in the African American literature tradition of political protest. Stamps, Arkansas, as depicted in Caged Bird, has very little \"social ambiguity\"; it is a racist world divided between Black and white, male and female. Angelou demonstrates, through her involvement with the Black community of Stamps, her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters, \"the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans\", and her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society. Hilton Als characterizes the division as \"good and evil\", and notes how Angelou's witness of the evil in her society, which was directed at Black women, shaped Angelou's young life and informed her views into adulthood. Angelou uses the metaphor of a bird struggling to escape its cage, described in Paul Laurence Dunbar's poem, as a prominent symbol throughout her series of autobiographies. Like elements within a prison narrative, the caged bird represents Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and oppression, forces that were outside Maya's control or comprehension. The caged bird metaphor also invokes the \"supposed contradiction of the bird singing in the midst of its struggle\". Scholar Ernece B. Kelley calls Caged Bird a \"gentle indictment of white American womanhood\"; Hagen expands it further, stating that the book is \"a dismaying story of white dominance\". In the Stamps of Caged Bird, although \"segregation was so complete that most Black children didn't really, absolutely know what Whites looked like\" and Blacks rarely interacted with them, the white world was a constant threat and Blacks were expected to behave in a certain way in order to survive. As Keneth Kinnamon states, Angelou does not de-emphasize the effects of racism on her community, but \"shows with respect if not always agreement the defensive and compensatory patterns needed to survive in such an environment\". Lupton, who sees the themes of racism and slavery as separate from imprisonment in Caged Bird, states that Maya constantly feels caged, \"unable to escape the reality of her blackness\". Imprisonment is also expressed in the book's title.\n\nAngelou's autobiographies, beginning with Caged Bird, contain a sequence of lessons about resisting oppression. The sequence she describes leads Angelou, as the protagonist, from \"helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest\".  Walker insists that Angelou's treatment of racism is what gives her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores one of their central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. In Angelou's depiction of the \"powhitetrash\" incident, Maya reacts with rage, indignation, humiliation, and helplessness. Angelou portrays Momma as a realist whose patience, courage, and silence ensured the survival and success of those who came after her. As Braxton put it, the white and female children \"deliberately exploit their protected status to intimidate and humiliate\" Maya's family. Braxton also considers the incident an implied threat towards the men in the family. Momma teaches Maya how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing with racism, and that it is an effective basis for actively protesting and combating racism. Walker calls Momma's way a \"strategy of subtle resistance\"; Dolly McPherson calls it \"the dignified course of silent endurance\" and \"a pivotal experience in her initiation\" of Maya's awareness about her place in the racist world. McPherson, who considers the incident \"a dramatic re-enactment of the kind of spiritual death and regeneration Angelou experienced during the shaping of her development\", also states that the incident taught Maya how her grandmother was able to survive and triumph psychologically in a hostile environment. Not only was it a depiction of the tensions between Blacks and whites during the period, it also depicted how Momma was able to protest, transcend the children's behavior towards her, and preserve her own dignity. Braxton states that the incident demonstrates Momma's courage, a virtue Angelou learns to use and develop from her; Angelou praises Momma's courage in the book and praises it in later writings. Courage in the face of racism is also shown in Angelou's treatment of lynching. Early in the book, Momma helps a man trying to escape lynching by hiding him and giving him supplies for his journey, thus endangering her own security. Later, the family has to conceal Uncle Willy from a potential lynch mob in their store's potato and onion bin. Braxton states that it demonstrates the absurdity of lynching and that in this incident, Momma \"fulfills the archetypical role of the outraged mother by concealing her innocent child\".\n\nAngelou later said that her years living in Africa and her relationship to South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make in the early 1960s taught her \"to see the survival of distinctly African ways\" among African Americans, which affect her portrayal of character, both collectively and individually. For example, as Susan Gilbert puts it, Angelou \"relates the habits of address...to a heritage of tribal belonging\". Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps also demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions. Angelou demonstrates how religion, which \"was designed to keep the Afro-American in an oppressed condition\", has been subverted and used by her community to help them withstand the cruelty of racism. McPherson states that Angelou's depiction of the economic displacement of Black cotton field workers, who gather at Momma's store before and after work and could never get ahead despite their hard work, demonstrates how the Black community nurtures its members and helps them survive in an antagonistic environment. Angelou's depiction of the Joe Lewis fight demonstrates how her community has subverted the American institution of sports. As Selwyn R. Cudjoe puts it, the fight was supposed to \"act as a pacifier, as entertainment for Blacks, and to help demonstrate how far they had progressed in the society\". Instead, it became a recreation of the struggle between white and Black America. Later in the book, Maya responds assertively when subjected to demeaning treatment by Mrs. Cullinan and breaks the race barrier when she becomes the first Black streetcar operator in San Francisco. McPherson states that Maya's experience with Mrs. Cullinan places her \"into a clearer awareness of social reality and into a growing consciousness of self-worth\". Mrs. Cullinan's attempt to change Maya's name to fit her own convenience also \"echoes the larger tradition of American racism that attempts to prescribe the nature and limitations of a Black person's identity\". Maya stands up for her individuality and value by deliberately breaking Mrs. Cullinan's heirloom china.\nAngelou describes other incidences that demonstrate the strength and unity in Stamps. As McPherson puts it, \"Unlike the white American, in order for the individual black American to be self-reliant, he or she must rely on the community\". Lupton states that Angelou's emphasis on collectivity, \"a major aspect of black survival\", is relevant in Caged Bird. McPherson agrees, although how Maya uses and defines community changes when she leaves Stamps, and continues to adapt later in her life, as she describes in the later volumes of her autobiographical story. Kinnamon, in his comparison of Caged Bird and Richard Wright's Black Boy, states that unlike Wright, whose response to the poverty and racism of his childhood is \"individualistic alienation from all sense of community\", Angelou's response is to embrace community. Kinnamon calls Caged Bird \"a celebration of black culture\". Also unlike Wright, Angelou recalls the larger rituals of black community, such as religious practices, the radio broadcast of the Joe Lewis fight, a summer fish fry, the telling of ghost stories, and graduation activities, favorably. McPherson states that Angelou uses community to demonstrate how Blacks survived racism; as McPherson puts it, \"personal values become synonymous with Stamps' communal values\". Liliane Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a Black child, evolves out of her \"racial hatred\", common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers. McPherson states that Caged Bird describes centuries-long traditions, developed in Africa and during slavery, that taught Black children to never resist \"the idea that whites were better, cleaner, or more intelligent than blacks\". At first, Maya wishes that she could become white, since growing up Black in white America is dangerous; later she sheds her self-loathing and embraces a strong racial identity. Both Angelou's depiction of her community's reaction to the victorious Joe Louis fight and her elementary school graduation, in which they respond to a racist school official demeaning their future opportunities by singing \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\", demonstrate the strength and resiliency of her community.\n\n\n=== Rape ===\nAngelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the autobiography, although it is presented briefly in the text. Opal Moore calls Angelou's graphic and complicated depiction of rape and incest \"the center and bottom\" of the autobiography and states the rape must be understood within the context of the entire book; everything that happens to Maya in it \"should be understood against the ravaging of rape\". For Moore, the rape \"raises issues of trust, truth, and lie, love, and the naturalness of a child's craving for human contact, language and understanding, and the confusion engendered by the power disparities that necessarily exist between children and adults\". Angelou describes two sexual encounters with Mr. Freeman; she uses metaphors, which allow her to describe her pain without having to explain what and how she feels.\nScholar Mary Vermillion compares Angelou's treatment of rape in Caged Bird to Harriet Jacobs' in her 1861 autobiography, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. According to Vermillion, one major difference between Angelou and Jacobs is the way somatophobia, which Vermillion defines as the \"fear and disdain for the body\", especially the female body, is depicted in their books. Angelou, for example, is freer to portray her rape, her body, and her sexuality than Jacobs because she does not have to deal with the 19th century patriarchal view of \"true womanhood\". Jacobs describes herself as beautiful and sexually desirable, but Angelou, as a child and young adult, thinks she is ugly. Jacobs and Angelou both use rape as a metaphor for the suffering of African Americans; Jacobs uses the metaphor to critique slaveholding culture, while Angelou uses it to first internalize, then challenge, 20th-century racist conceptions of the Black female body. Angelou connects her rape with the suffering of the poor and the subjection of her race and \"represents the black girl's difficulties in controlling, understanding, and respecting both her body and her words\". Vermillion also connects the violation of Maya's body to her self-imposed muteness because she believes that her lie during the trial is responsible for her rapist's death. McPherson evaluates the rape in Caged Bird in light of how it affected Maya's identity, and how her displacement from the dangerous but comfortable setting of Stamps to her mother's chaotic and unfamiliar world of St. Louis contributes to Maya's trauma and withdrawal into herself. Sondra O'Neale states, however, that the birth of Maya's son at the end of the book provides the reader with hope for her future and implies that the rape would not control her life.\n\nArensberg, who blames Maya's vulnerability on her previous experiences of neglect, abandonment, and lack of parental love, notes that Maya's rape is connected to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape was the first time he touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, \"I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk\". Christine Froula connects Maya's self-imposed muteness with Ovid's retelling of the Philomela rape myth, in which the victim's power of speech becomes a threat to the rapist and another victim of the rapist.\nSelwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou's depiction of the rape \"a burden\" of Caged Bird: a demonstration of \"the manner in which the Black female is violated in her tender years and ... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence\". Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender. When Joanne Braxton asked Angelou decades later how she was able to survive the trauma she experienced, Angelou explained it by stating, \"I can't remember a time when I wasn't loved by somebody\". She also told Braxton that she thought about the rape daily and that she wrote about the experience because it was the truth and because she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape for both the victim and the rapist. She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else and so that the rape victim might gain understanding, forgive herself, and not blame herself.\n\n\n=== Literacy ===\n\nAs Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, especially Caged Bird and its immediate sequel Gather Together in My Name, are \"very much concerned with what [Angelou] knew and how she learned it\". Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the \"direct instruction of African American cultural forms\". Angelou's quest for learning and literacy parallels \"the central myth of black culture in America\": that freedom and literacy are connected. As Fred Lee Hord puts it, \"the book world was a world of integration, where you were the confidant of all the denizens—in whose skins, regardless of color, you could move inside and breathe free\". Hord adds that Maya also rejected the part of her culture \"that she associated with powerlessness in the world of book learning\". For example, one of the most traumatic experiences Angelou relates in Caged Bird is her eighth-grade graduation, when the white commencement speaker denigrates Blacks, reduces their potential to athletics, and conveys to his audience a sense of impotence and nothingness. The anger and depression Maya feels changes when Henry Reed leads the audience and graduates in the Negro National Anthem, when Maya senses the pride and strength of her community. As Hord puts it, Maya realizes, for the first time, \"how black writers not only made possible an alternative world, but pushed the boundaries outward in her actual world\". Hord also states that the white speaker helped Maya demystify her ideas about the power of education for African Americans; the composer of the Anthem also provided her with the strength to resist the white speaker's dehumanization of her community.\nAngelou states, early in Caged Bird, \"During these years in Stamps, I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare. He was my first white love. Although I enjoyed and respected Kipling, Poe, Butler, Thackeray and Henley, I saved my young and loyal passion for Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson and W. E. B. DuBois' 'Litany at Atlanta.' But it was Shakespeare who said, 'When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes.' It was a state with which I felt most familiar\". As Hord states, Shakespeare identified with the state Maya, \"a young castaway without parents in a freedom-stifling, small southern town\", found herself in. Christine Froula, though, in her discussion about incest in Caged Bird and Alice Walker's The Color Purple, points out that Maya and Bailey gave up memorizing a scene from Shakespeare to avoid their grandmother's opposition to reading a white author, choosing Johnson's \"The Creation\" instead. Froula goes on to state that the vignette \"raises the question of what it means for a female reader and fledging writer to carry on a love affair with Shakespeare or with male authors in general\" and connects Maya's attraction to Shakespeare and his writings with Maya's rape described later on. Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's The Rape of Lucrece, which Vermillion calls \"Angelou's most complex and subtle examination of Maya's attachment to white literary discourse\" and which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech. Vermillion maintains that Maya's attachment to Lucrece indicates her attachment to the verbal and the literary, which leads her to ignore her corporeality and helps her find comfort in the poem's identification with suffering. As Vermillion states, Maya must use the words she memorizes and recites to reconstruct her own body. Froula says that although Maya's memorization of Lucrece helps her overcome her literal muteness, it ushers her into a literary recovery because it connects her voice to Shakespeare's words. Froula goes on to say, \"But if Shakespeare's poem redeems Maya of her hysterical silence, it is also a lover she embraces at her peril\" because it \"signals a double seduction\" of white and male culture. Braxton, however, explains Maya's connection with Shakespeare and with Dunbar, who influenced Angelou more than the other writers she names in Caged Bird, by stating that they \"speak directly to her dilemma—the problem of developing a positive self-image in a culture whose standards of beauty are uniformly white, and the problem of finding a place for herself in that culture\". Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape, writing in Caged Bird, \"...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the Green Hornet would bust in the door and save me\".\nAccording to Walker, the power of words is another theme that appears repeatedly in Caged Bird. For example, Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words. Mrs. Flowers, by introducing her to classic literature and poetry, teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again. Myra K. McMurray agrees, saying that Angelou uses art, even the artistic aspects of the Joe Lewis fight and of other instances, to demonstrate her community's survival instincts. The importance of both the spoken and written word appears repeatedly in Caged Bird and in all of Angelou's autobiographies. Referring to the importance of literacy and methods of effective writing, Angelou once advised Oprah Winfrey in a 1993 interview to \"do as West Africans do ... listen to the deep talk\", or the \"utterances existing beneath the obvious\". As Liliane Arensberg puts it, \"If there is one stable element in Angelou's youth it is [a] dependence upon books\" and fiction, including The Lone Ranger, The Shadow, and Marvel Comics, and works by Shakespeare, Poe, Dunbar, Jane Austen, William Makepeace Thackeray, Samuel Johnson, Langston Hughes, and W. E. B. Du Bois. The public library is a \"quiet refuge\" to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis. Novels and the characters in them became Maya's references for viewing and dealing with the world around her. Hagen describes Angelou as a \"natural story-teller\", which \"reflect[s] a good listener with a rich oral heritage\". Hagen also insists that Angelou's years of muteness provided her with this skill. Books and poetry, with Mrs. Flowers' help, become Maya's \"first life line\" and a way to cope with the trauma of her rape. First, Mrs. Flowers treats her as an individual, unconnected to another person, and then by encouraging Maya to memorize and recite poetry, gives her a \"sense of power within herself, a transcendence over her immediate environment\". Mrs. Flowers' friendship awakens Maya's conscience, increases her perspective of what is around her and of the relationship between Black culture and the larger society, and teaches her about \"the beauty and power of language\". Their friendship also inspires Maya to begin writing poetry and record her observations of the world around her.\nAngelou was also influenced by slave narratives, spirituals, and other autobiographies. Angelou read through the Bible twice as a young child, and memorized many passages from it. African American spirituality, as represented by Angelou's grandmother, has influenced all of Angelou's writings, in the activities of the church community she first experiences in Stamps, in the sermons and public addresses, and in scripture. Angelou told an interviewer in 1981 that the Bible and the language spoken at church was crucial to her development as a writer, likening it to going to the opera. Hagen says that in addition to being influenced by rich literary form, Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions. In Caged Bird, Mrs. Flowers encourages her to listen carefully to \"Mother Wit\", which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African American community as expressed in folklore and humor. Arensberg states that Angelou uses the literary technique of wit, humor, and irony to defeat her enemies by mocking them and using her adult narrative voice. In tis way, Angelou \"retaliates for the tongue-tied child's helpful pain\". Arensberg goes on to state that Angelou even ridicules the child version of herself, although unlike other autobiographers, she avoids linking the child she was to the adult she became. As Vermillion states, Angelou reembodies Maya following the trauma of her rape by critiquing her early dependency on white literary discourse, even though Angelou \"is not content to let the mute, sexually abused, wishing-to-be-white Maya represent the black female body in her text\".\nAngelou's humor in Caged Bird and in all her autobiographies is drawn from Black folklore and is used to demonstrate that in spite of severe racism and oppression, Black people thrive and are, as Hagen states, \"a community of song and laughter and courage\". According to Selwyn R. Cudjoe, although life is difficult for the individuals in Caged Bird, moments of happiness are not absent in the book. He compares Caged Bird to Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge, but states that \"such moments came...as 'the occasional episodes(s) in a general drama of pain'\". Hagen states that Angelou is able to make an indictment of institutionalized racism as she laughs at her flaws and the flaws of her community and \"balances stories of black endurance of oppression against white myths and misperceptions\". Hagen also characterizes Caged Bird as a \"blues genre autobiography\" because it uses elements of blues music. These elements include the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Hagen also sees elements of African American sermonizing in Caged Bird. Angelou's use of African-American oral traditions create a sense of community in her readers, and identifies those who belong to it. The vignettes in Caged Bird feature literary aspects such as oral story traditions and traditional religious beliefs and practices that depict African American cultural life. For example, the story about Maya's racist employer Mrs. Cullinan parallels traditional African American folklore, the significance, horror, and danger accompanied by the importance of naming in traditional society, and the practice of depriving slaves of their true names and cultural past.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception and sales ===\n\nI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is the most highly acclaimed of Angelou's autobiographies. The other volumes in her series of seven autobiographies are judged and compared to Caged Bird. It became a bestseller immediately after it was published. Angelou's friend and mentor, James Baldwin, maintained that her book \"liberates the reader into life\" and called it \"a Biblical study of life in the midst of death\". According to Angelou's biographers, \"Readers, especially women, and in particular Black women, took the book to heart\". By the mid-1980s, Caged Bird had gone through 20 hardback printings and 32 paperback printings. The week after Angelou recited her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration, sales of the paperback version of Caged Bird, which had sold steadily since its publication, and her other works rose by 300–600 percent. The 16-page publication of \"On the Pulse of Morning\" became a bestseller, and the recording of the poem was awarded a Grammy Award. The Bantam Books edition of Caged Bird was a bestseller for 36 weeks; 400,000 copies of her books were reprinted to meet demand. Random House, which published Angelou's hardcover books and the poem later that year, reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, marking a 1,200 percent increase.\nBy the end of 1969, critics had placed Angelou in the tradition of other Black autobiographers. Poet James Bertolino asserts that Caged Bird \"is one of the essential books produced by our culture\". He insists that \"[w]e should all read it, especially our children\". It was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970, has never been out of print, and has been published in many languages. It has been a Book of the Month Club selection and an Ebony Book Club selection. In 2011, Time Magazine placed the book in its list of 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923. Caged Bird catapulted Angelou to international fame and critical acclaim and was a significant development in Black women's literature because it \"heralded the success of other now prominent writers\".\nThe book's reception has not been universally positive; author Francine Prose, who calls Caged Bird a \"survival memoir,\" or \"a first-person narrative of victimization and recovery\", considers its inclusion, along with books like Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, in the high school curriculum as partly responsible for the \"dumbing down\" of American society. Prose calls the book \"manipulative melodrama\", and considers Angelou's writing style an inferior example of poetic prose in memoir. She faults Angelou with poor writing, including combing a dozen metaphors in one paragraph and \"obscuring ideas that could be expressed so much more simply and felicitously\".\n\nSusan Gilbert calls Caged Bird \"a story of hurt, and loneliness, and anger, and love\" and Robert A. Gross calls the book \"a tour de force of language\". Other reviewers have praised Angelou's use of language in the book, including E. M. Guiney, who reports that Caged Bird was \"one of the best autobiographies of its kind that I have read\". Edmund Fuller insists that Angelou's intellectual range and artistry were apparent in how she told her story and Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls it \"a triumph of truth in simple, forthright terms\". R. A. Gross praises Angelou for her use of rich and dazzling images and Dolly McPherson praises Angelou for describing \"a life lived with intensity, honesty, and a remarkable combination of innocence and knowledge\". McPherson, who calls Angelou \"an accomplished writer\", calls the book \"a carefully conceived record of a young girl's slow and clumsy growth\" and \"a record of her initiation into her world and her discovery of her interior identity\". She goes on to praise Angelou for confronting her own painful past while recognizing that the painful events in her life \"form a necessary part of her development\". McPherson also states that Angelou uses her narrative gifts and use of language to confidently and effectively describe her painful memories, while understanding that \"events are not only significant in themselves, but because they mark points of transcendence\". Harold Bloom calls Caged Bird \"more a carol than it is a prayer or plea\" and Sidonie Ann Smith states that Angelou's \"genius as a writer is her ability to recapture the texture of the way of life in the texture of its idioms, its idiosyncratic vocabulary and especially in its process of image-making\". \nOpal Moore, in her criticism of the push to ban Caged Bird from schools, states that the book's message of overcoming racism transcends its author and that the book \"is an affirmation; it promises that life, if we have the courage to live it, will be worth the struggle\". Liliane Arensberg states that like all autobiographies, Caged Bird \"seems a conscious defense against the pain felt at evoking unpleasant memories\". Mary Jane Lupton compares Angelou's works with Richard Wright's two-volume serial autobiographies, stating that Angelou's transitions between her volumes are smoother than Wright's and that her presentation of herself as a character is more consistent. Lupton also compares Angelou's autobiographies with Dust Tracks on a Road (1942) by Zora Neale Hurston, Coming of Age in Mississippi (1968) by Anne Moody, Report From Part One (1972) by Gwendolyn Brooks, Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood (1996) by bell hooks, and Lilian Hellman's series of four autobiographies. McPherson says that Angelou's serial autobiographies, along with other contemporary autobiographies written by Baldwin, Moody, and Malcolm X, \"is the urge to articulate, as if for the first time, a sensibility at once determined and precluded by history\".\n\n\n=== Influence ===\nWhen Caged Bird was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African-American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. Up to that point, Black women writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters. Julian Mayfield, who calls Caged Bird \"a work of art that eludes description\", has insisted that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for African American autobiography as a whole. Hilton Als insists that Caged Bird marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as he put it, \"write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense\". After writing Caged Bird, Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for Blacks and women. Caged Bird made her \"without a doubt ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer\". Although Als considers Caged Bird an important contribution to the increase of Black feminist writings in the 1970s, he attributes its success less to its originality than to \"its resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist\" of its time, at the end of the American Civil Rights Movement. Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, freed many other women writers to \"open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world\".\nOpal Moore has called for better preparation for teachers who use Caged Bird in their classrooms, stating that the book is a difficult text for both teachers and students. Angelou's autobiographies, especially Caged Bird, have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches to teacher education. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at George Washington University, has used Caged Bird and Gather Together in My Name when training teachers to appropriately explore racism in their classrooms. Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony causes readers to wonder what she \"left out\" and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes. These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society. Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African American autobiography and her literary techniques, readers react to her storytelling with \"surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography\".\nEducator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, analyzed the events in Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called Caged Bird a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.\n\n\n=== Censorship ===\n\nCaged Bird has been criticized by many parents, causing it to be removed from school curricula and library shelves. The book was approved to be taught in public schools and was placed in public school libraries through the U.S. in the early-1980s, and was included in Advanced Placement and gifted student curriculum. Attempts by parents to censor it began in 1983. Some have been critical of its sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent religious depictions. Many parents throughout the U.S. have sought to ban the book from schools and libraries for being inappropriate for younger high school students, for promoting premarital sex, homosexuality, cohabitation, and pornography, and for not supporting traditional values. Parents have also objected to the book's use of profanity and to its graphic and violent depiction of rape and racism. Educators have responded to these challenges by removing it from reading lists and libraries, by providing students with alternatives, and by requiring parental permission from students. In 2009, Angelou expressed her sorrow and outrage about the banning of all her books, stating that those who insisted upon banning them had not read them. She also said, “I feel sorry for the young person who never gets to read [Caged Bird]\".\nIn 2021, the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center, which stated that banning books like Caged Bird and The Color Purple by Alice Walker \"points to a larger pattern of banning books significant to African American history and culture\". They found that Caged Bird was banned in prisons throughout the U.S.; for example, the book was banned in North Carolina prisons because officials determined that its depiction of sexual assault was a security threat.\nIn 2023, the book was banned, in Clay County District Schools, Florida.\nCaged Bird appeared third on the American Library Association (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000, sixth on the ALA's 2000–2009 list, and fell to 88th place on the ALA's 2010–2019 list. As of 1998, it was one of the ten books most frequently banned from high school and junior high school libraries and classrooms.\nIn April of 2025, the United States Naval Academy's library removed Caged Bird and 380 more books \"after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office ordered the school to get rid of ones that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\"\n\n\n=== Film version ===\nA made-for-TV movie version of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was filmed in Mississippi and aired on April 28, 1979, on CBS.  Angelou and Leonora Thuna wrote the teleplay; the movie was directed by Fielder Cook. Constance Good played young Maya. Also appearing were actors Esther Rolle, Roger E. Mosley, Diahann Carroll, Ruby Dee, and Madge Sinclair. Two scenes in the movie differed from events described in the book. Angelou added a scene between Maya and Uncle Willie after the Joe Louis fight; in it, he expresses his feelings of redemption and hope after Louis defeats a white opponent. Angelou and Thuna also present Maya's eighth grade graduation differently in the film. In the book, Henry Reed delivers the valedictory speech and leads the Black audience in the Negro national anthem. In the movie, Maya conducts these activities.\n\n\n== Explanatory footnotes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== Sources cited ==\nAngelou, Maya (1969). I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.

The introduction of artificial lighting extended daytime activities. Major European cities hung lanterns housing candles and oil lamps in the 1600s. Nineteenth-century gas and electric lights created unprecedented illumination. The range of socially acceptable leisure activities expanded, and various industries introduced a night shift. Nightlife, encompassing bars, nightclubs, and cultural venues, has become a significant part of urban culture, contributing to social and political movements.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word night is derived from the Old English niht. Both words are Germanic and cognates of the German nacht. The terms belong to a family of night words present in nearly all European languages, derived from an Indo-European word, reconstructed as *nekwt. The original root is thought most likely to be *nek-, a term relating to death. According to the nineteenth-century British philologist Walter William Skeat, this root meant 'to perish', 'to disappear', or 'to fail', with night being the point where light ceased and perished. More recently, Roland Pooth has argued for the root term to be understood to mean 'empty' or 'naked', with night being the point where the sky is naked and empty of light. As a result of this early origin, night shares its root with the Latin nox, the root of many English terms connected to the night, such as equinox and nocturnal.\nCognates of day are less widespread. Philologist Ernest Weekley attributed the many related night words to the early practice of measuring time in nights rather than days. The term fortnight, an Old English contraction of \"fourteen nights\", is a remnant of this ancient custom of measuring time in nights.\nThe letters \"gh\" were added to the word to represent the yogh character (Ȝ), unavailable on printing presses imported from continental Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. As English speakers ceased to pronounce the yogh, the \"gh\" became silent. A similar process occurred in many English words, such as light.\n\n\n== Astronomy ==\nA planet's rotation causes nighttime and daytime. When a place on Earth is pointed away from the Sun, that location experiences night. The Sun appears to set in the West and rise in the East due to Earth's rotation. Many celestial bodies, including the other planets in the solar system, have a form of night.\n\n\n=== Earth ===\n\nThe length of night on Earth varies depending on the time of year. Longer nights occur in winter, with the winter solstice being the longest. Nights are shorter in the summer, with the summer solstice being the shortest. Earth orbits the Sun on an axis tilted 23.44 degrees. Nights are longer when a hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun and shorter when a hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun. As a result, the longest night of the year for the Northern Hemisphere will be the shortest night of the year for the Southern Hemisphere.\nNight's duration varies least near the equator. The difference between the shortest and longest night increases approaching the poles. At the equator, night lasts roughly 12 hours throughout the year. The tropics have little difference in the length of day and night. At the 45th parallel, the longest winter night is roughly twice as long as the shortest summer night. Within the polar circles, night will last the full 24 hours of the winter solstice. The length of this polar night increases closer to the poles. Utqiagvik, Alaska, the northernmost point in the United States, experiences 65 days of polar night. At the pole itself, polar night lasts 179 days from September to March.\n\nOver a year, there is more daytime than nighttime because of the Sun's size and atmospheric refraction. The Sun is not a single point. Viewed from Earth, the Sun ranges in angular diameter from 31 to 33 arcminutes. When the center of the Sun falls to the western horizon, half of the Sun will still be visible during sunset. Likewise, by the time the center of the Sun rises to the eastern horizon, half of the Sun will already be visible during sunrise. This shortens night by about three minutes in temperate zones. Atmospheric refraction is a larger factor. Refraction bends sunlight over the horizon. On Earth, the Sun remains briefly visible after it has geometrically fallen below the horizon. This shortens night by about six minutes. Scattered, diffuse sunlight remains in the sky after sunset and into twilight.\n\nTwilight, the gradual transition to and from darkness when the Sun is below the horizon, has multiple stages. \"Civil\" twilight occurs when the Sun is between 0° and 6° below the horizon. Nearby planets like Venus and bright stars like Sirius are visible during this period. \"Nautical\" twilight continues until the Sun is 12° below the horizon. During nautical twilight, the horizon is visible enough for navigation. \"Astronomical\" twilight continues until the Sun has sunk 18° below the horizon. Beyond 18°, refracted sunlight is no longer visible. The period when the sun is 18° or more below either horizon is called astronomical night.\nSimilar to the duration of night itself, the duration of twilight varies according to latitude. At the equator, day quickly transitions to night, while the transition can take weeks near the poles. The duration of twilight is longest at the summer solstice and shortest near the equinoxes. Moonlight, starlight, airglow, and light pollution can dimly illuminate the nighttime, with their diffuse aspects being termed skyglow. The amount of skyglow increases each year due to artificial lighting.\n\n\n=== Other celestial bodies ===\n\nNight exists on the other planets and moons in the Solar System. The length of night is affected by the rotation period and orbital period of the celestial object. The lunar phases visible from Earth result from nightfall on the Moon. The Moon has longer nights than Earth, lasting about two weeks. This is half of the synodic lunar month, the time it takes the Moon to cycle through its phases. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth; it rotates so that one side of the Moon always faces the Earth. The side of the Moon facing away from Earth is called the far side of the Moon, and the side facing Earth is called the near side of the Moon. During lunar night on the near side, Earth appears 50 times brighter than a full moon appears from Earth. Because the Moon has no atmosphere, there is an abrupt transition from day to night without twilight.\n\nNight varies from planet to planet within the Solar System. Mars's dusty atmosphere causes a lengthy twilight period. The refracted light ranges from purple to blue, often resulting in glowing noctilucent clouds. Venus and Mercury have long nights because of their slow rotational periods. The planet Venus rotates once every 243 Earth days. Because of its unusual retrograde rotation, nights last just over 58 Earth days. The dense greenhouse atmosphere on Venus keeps its surface hot enough to melt lead throughout the night. Its planetary wind system, driven by solar heat, reverses direction from day to night. Venus's winds flow from the equator to the poles on the day side and from the poles to the equator on the night side. On Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, the temperature drops by over 1,000 °F (538 °C) after nightfall.\nThe day–night cycle is one consideration for planetary habitability or the possibility of extraterrestrial life on distant exoplanets. In general, shorter nights result in a higher equilibrium temperature for the planet. On an Earth-like planet, longer day–night cycles may increase habitability up to a point. Computer models show that longer nights would affect Hadley circulation, resulting in a cooler, less cloudy planet. Once the rotation speed of a planet slows beyond 1/16 that of Earth, the difference in day-to-night temperature shifts increases dramatically. Some exoplanets, like those of TRAPPIST-1, are tidally locked. Tidally locked planets have equal rotation and orbital periods, so one side experiences constant day, and the other side constant night. In these situations, astrophysicists believe that life would most likely develop in the twilight zone between the day and night hemispheres.\n\n\n== Biology ==\n\nLiving organisms react directly to the darkness of night. Light and darkness also affect circadian rhythms, the physical and mental changes that occur in a 24-hour cycle. This daily cycle is regulated by an internal \"biological clock\" that is adjusted by exposure to light. The length and timing of nighttime depend on location and time of year. Organisms that are more active at night possess adaptations to the night's dimmer light, increased humidity, and lower temperatures.\n\n\n=== Animals ===\nAnimals that are active primarily at night are called nocturnal and usually possess adaptations for night vision. In vertebrates' eyes, two types of photoreceptor cells sense light. Cone cells sense color but are ineffective in low light; rod cells sense only brightness but remain effective in very dim light. The eyes of nocturnal animals have a greater percentage of rod cells. In most mammals, rod cells contain densely packed DNA near the edge of the nucleus. For nocturnal mammals, this is reversed with the densely packed DNA in the center of the nucleus, which reduces the scattering of light. Some nocturnal animals have a mirror, the tapetum lucidum, behind the retina. This doubles the amount of light their eyes can process.\n\nThe compound eyes of insects can see at even lower levels of light. For example, the elephant hawk moth can see in color, including ultraviolet, with only starlight. Nocturnal insects navigate using moonlight, lunar phases, infrared vision, the position of the stars, and the Earth's magnetic field. Artificial lighting disrupts the biorhythms of many animals. Night-flying insects that use the moon for navigation are especially vulnerable to disorientation from increasing levels of artificial lighting. Artificial lights attract many night-flying insects that die from exhaustion and nocturnal predators. Decreases in insect populations disrupt the overall ecosystem because their larvae are a key food source for smaller fish. Dark-sky advocate Paul Bogard described the unnatural migration of night-flying insects from the unlit Nevada desert into Las Vegas as \"like sparkling confetti floating in the beam's white column\".\n\nSome nocturnal animals have developed other senses to compensate for limited light. Many snakes have a pit organ that senses infrared light and enables them to detect heat. Nocturnal mice possess a vomeronasal organ that enhances their sense of smell. Bats heavily depend on echolocation. Echolocation allows an animal to navigate with their sense of hearing by emitting sounds and listening for the time it takes them to bounce back. Bats emit a steady stream of clicks while hunting insects and home in on prey as thin as human hair.\n\nPeople and other diurnal animals sleep primarily at night. Humans, other mammals, and birds experience multiple stages of sleep visible via electroencephalography. The stages of sleep are wakefulness, three stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), including deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During REM sleep, dreams are more frequent and complex. Studies show that some reptiles may also experience REM sleep. During deep sleep, memories are consolidated into long-term memory. Invertebrates most likely experience a form of sleep as well. Studies on bees, which have complex brain structures unrelated to vertebrate brains, have shown improvements in memory after sleep, similar to mammals.\nCompared to waking life, dreams are sparse with limited sensory detail. Dreams are hallucinatory or bizarre, and they often have a narrative structure. Many hypotheses exist to explain the function of dreams without a definitive answer. Nightmares are dreams that cause distress. The word \"night-mare\" originally referred to nocturnal demons that were believed to assail sleeping dreamers, like the incubus (male) or succubus (female). It was believed that the demons could sit upon a dreamer's chest to suffocate a victim, as depicted in John Henry Fuseli's The Nightmare.\n\n\n=== Fungi ===\n\nFungi can sense the presence and absence of light, and the nightly changes of most fungi growth and biological processes are direct responses to either darkness or falling temperatures. By night, fungi are more engaged in synthesizing cellular components and increasing their biomass. For example, fungi that prey on insects will infect the central nervous system of their prey, allowing the fungi to control the actions of the dying insect. During the late afternoon, the fungi will pilot their prey to higher elevations where wind currents can carry its spores further, and at night, will kill and digest the insect, extending fruiting bodies from the host's exoskeleton. Most fungi do not have true circadian rhythms. The bread mold Neurospora crassa is used to study biorhythms because it is one of the few species of fungi to rely on an internal clock rather than directly on environmental changes.\n\n\n=== Plants ===\n\nDuring the day, plants engage in photosynthesis and release oxygen. By night, plants engage in respiration, consuming oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Plants can draw up more water after sunset, which facilitates new leaf growth. As plants cannot create energy through photosynthesis after sunset, they use energy stored in the plant, typically as starch granules. Plants use this stored energy at a steady rate, depleting their reserves almost right at dawn. Plants will adjust their rate of consumption to match the expected time until sunrise. This avoids prematurely running out of starch reserves, and it allows the plant to adjust for longer nights in the winter. If a plant is subjected to artificially early darkness, it will ration its energy consumption to last until dawn.\nSucculent plants, including cacti, have adapted to the limited water availability in arid environments like deserts. The stomata of cacti do not open until night. When the temperature drops, the pores open to allow the cacti to store carbon dioxide for photosynthesis the next day, a process known as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). Cacti and night-blooming plants use CAM to store up to 99% of the carbon dioxide they use in daily photosynthesis. Ceroid cacti often have flowers that bloom at night and fade before sunrise. As few bees are nocturnal, night-flowering plants rely on other pollinators, including moths, beetles, and bats. These flowers rely more on the pollinators' sense of smell, with strong perfumes to attract moths and foul-smelling odors to attract bats.\nEukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms that engage in photosynthesis are also affected by nightfall. Like plants, algae will switch to taking in oxygen and processing energy stored as starch. Cyanobacteria switch from photosynthesis to nitrogen fixation after sunset. They also absorb genetic material from their environment at a higher rate during the night.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== History and technology ===\n\nBefore the industrial era, night was a time of heightened insecurity. Fear of the night was common but varied in intensity across cultures. Some psychologists have concluded that prehistoric people feared real and tangible harms present during the night and that these concrete fears developed into a broader fear of night itself.\nDangers increased due to lower visibility. Injuries and deaths were caused by drowning and falling into pits, ditches, and shafts. People were less able to evaluate others after dark. Due to nocturnal alcohol consumption and the anonymity of darkness, quarrels were more likely to escalate to violence. For example, in medieval Stockholm, the majority of murders were committed while intoxicated.\nCrime and fear of crime increased at night. In pre-industrial Europe, criminals disguised themselves with hats, face paint, or cloaks. Thieves would trip pedestrians with ropes laid across streets and dismount horse riders using long poles extended from the roadside shadows. They used \"dark lanterns\" where light could be shined through a single side. Most nocturnal thieves worked alone; organized criminal gangs were uncommon except for burglary. With members numbering into the dozens and hundreds, burglary rings hacked, cut, smashed, and burrowed into homes when residents were sleeping. They used a range of brutality to subdue and intimidate the residents, with the French chauffeurs infamously torturing victims with fire. With nothing comparable to a modern police force, these burglary gangs then escaped into the night, often disguised as demons, ghosts, or monsters. Burglary rings also employed arson both to create distraction and to flush people from their locked homes.\nEarly sources of heat and illumination (such as chimneys, candles, and oil lamps) created inherent fire risks while families slept. Additionally, bakers and brewers kept fires constantly burning near stacks of wood and charcoal. Cities and towns regularly burned to the ground. One English town, Stratford-upon-Avon, was consumed by fire four times in five years. The increased humidity of night was deemed the result of vapors and fumes. The annual movements of stars and constellations across the night sky were used to track the passage of time, but other changes in the night sky were interpreted as significant omens.\nMany daytime religious, governmental, and local social controls dissipated after nightfall. Fortified Christian communities announced the coming darkness with horns, church bells, or drums. This alerted residents—like peasants working in the fields—to return home before the city gates shut. The English engaged in a daily process of \"shutting in\", where valuables were brought into homes before they were bolted, barred, locked, and shuttered. Many English and European towns attempted to impose curfews during the medieval period and gradually loosened the restrictions via exceptions. Prayer and folk magic were more common by night. Amulets were hung to ward off nightmares, spells were cast against thievery, and pig hearts were hung in chimneys to block demons from traveling down them. The common phrase \"good night\" has been shortened from \"God give you a good night.\" In Ottoman Istanbul, the royal palaces shifted to projecting nocturnal power through large parties lit by lanterns, candles, and fireworks. Though alcohol was forbidden for Muslims, after dark, Turkish Muslims went to bars and taverns beyond the Muslim areas.\nThe night has long been a time of increased sexual activity, especially in taboo forms such as premarital, extramarital, gay, and lesbian sex. In colonial New England courtship, young unmarried couples practiced bundling before marriage. The couples would lie down in the woman's bed, her family would wrap them tightly with blankets, and they would spend the night together this way. Some families took precautions to prevent unintended pregnancies, like sleeping in the same room, laying a large wooden board between the couple, or pulling a single stocking over both of their daughter's legs. Historian Roger Ekirch described pre-industrial night as a \"sanctuary from ordinary existence.\"\n\nArtificial lighting expanded the scope of acceptable work and leisure after dark. In the 1600s, the major European cities introduced streetlights. These were lit by lamplighters each evening outside of the summer months. Early streetlights were metal and glass enclosures housing candles or oil lamps. They were suspended above streets or mounted on posts. The use of artificial lighting led to an increase in acceptable nightlife. In more rural areas, night remained a period of rest and nocturnal labor. Young adults, the urban poor, prostitutes, and thieves benefited from the anonymity of darkness and frequently smashed the new lanterns. Gas lighting was invented in the 1800s. A gas mantle was over ten times brighter than an oil lamp. Gas lighting was associated with the creation of regular police forces. In England, police departments were tasked with maintaining the gas lights, which became known as \"police lamps\". Daytime routines were further pushed back into the night by the electric light bulb—invented in the late 19th century—and the widespread usage of newer timekeeping devices like watches. Electric lights created night shifts for traditionally daytime fields, like India's cotton industry, and created opportunities for working adults to attend night school.\n\n\n=== Fear of the dark ===\nThe widespread usage of artificial lighting and other technologies has allowed many aspects of daily life and daytime social controls to continue after sunset. Fear of the dark and belief in creatures of the night has decreased but remains a significant part of modern life. One side effect of measures to police and promote urban nightlife is reduced personal privacy. Another side effect is the emergence of 8-hour sleep cycles replacing segmented sleep. Before the widespread usage of artificial lighting, sleep was typically split into two major segments separated by about an hour of wakefulness. During this midnight period, people engaged in prayer, crimes, urination, sex, and, most commonly, reflection. Without exposure to artificial light, studies show that people revert to sleeping in two separate intervals.\nFear of the dark and the night remains widespread and only amounts to a phobia in rare cases. Nighttime fears are especially common among children. These fears are typically mild, and most children grow out of them. About 1 in 5 children have persistent and intense fears that correlate with decreased sleep quality and anxiety for both the child and their family. Lucretius and Aristotle observed a similar fear of the dark more present among children in the classical era, and there are long traditions among various cultures of telling children bedtime stories of bogeymen and villains who prey upon disobedient children.\nAmong adults, walking alone after dark is a common nighttime fear. It is so common, that criminologists have used some variation of the question, \"How safe do you feel or would you feel being alone in your neighbourhood after dark?\" to gauge a population's fear of crime and victimization. The fear is most strongly reported by women and sexual minorities. A 1975 study found that the most common nighttime fears expressed by women were murder and sexual assault. Despite most urban crimes correlating to daytime hours of peak activity, violent crime remains most common after dark.\n\n\n=== Folklore and religion ===\n\nDiverse cultures have made connections between the night sky and the afterlife. Many Native American peoples have described the Milky Way as a path where the deceased travel as stars. The Lakota term for the Milky Way is Wanáǧi Thacháŋku, or \"Spirit's Road\". In Mayan mythology, the Milky Way's dark band is the Road of Xibalba, the path to the underworld. Unrelated cultures share a myth of a star-covered sky goddess who arches over the planet after sunset, like Citlālicue, the Aztec personification of the Milky Way. The elongated Egyptian goddess Nut and N!adima from Botswana are said to consume the Sun at dusk. In the Ancient Egyptian religion, the Sun then travels through the netherworld inside Nut's body, where it is reborn at dawn.\n\nMany cultures have personified the night. Ratri is the star-covered Hindu goddess of the night. In the Icelandic Prose Edda, night is embodied by Nótt. Ratri and Nött are goddesses of sleep and rest, but it is common for personifications to be associated with misfortune. In Aztec mythology, Black Tezcatlipoca, the \"Night Wind\", was associated with obsidian and the nocturnal jaguar. In his \"Precious Owl\" manifestation, the Aztecs regarded Tezcatlipoca as the bringer of death and destruction. The Aztecs anticipated an unending night when the Tzitzimīmeh, skeletal female star deities, would descend to consume all humans. In classical mythology, the night goddess Nyx is the mother of Sleep, Death, Disease, Strife, and Doom. In Jewish culture and mysticism, the demon Lilith embodies the emotional reactions to darkness, including terror, lust, and liberation.\nNighttime in the pre-industrial period, often called the \"night season\", was associated with darkness and uncertainty. Various cultures have regarded the night as a time when ghosts and other spirits are active on Earth. When Protestant theologians abandoned the concept of purgatory, many came to view reported ghost sightings as the result of demonic activity. In the sixteenth century, Swiss theologian Ludwig Lavater began attempting to explain reported spirits as mistakes, deceit, or the work of demons. The idea of night as a dangerous, dark, or haunted time persists in modern urban legends like the vanishing hitchhiker.\n\nMany times in the night season, there have been certain spirits heard softly going or spitting or groaning, who being asked what they were have made answer that they were the souls of this or that man and that they now endure extreme torments.\nIn folklore, nocturnal preternatural beings like goblins, fairies, werewolves, pucks, brownies, banshees, and boggarts have overlapping but non-synonymous definitions. The werewolf—and its francophone variations, the loup-garou and rougarou—were believed to be people who transformed into beasts at night. In West Africa and among the African diaspora, there is a widespread tradition of a type of vampire who removes their human skin at night and travels as a blood-sucking ball of light. Variation includes the feu-follet, the Surinamese asema, the Caribbean sukuyan, the Ashanti obayifo, and the Ghanaian asanbosam. The medieval fear of night-flying European witches was influenced by the Roman strix. The Romans described the strix as capable of changing between a beautiful woman and an owl-shaped monster. Common themes among these mythical nocturnal entities include hypersexuality, predation, shapeshifting, deception, mischief, and malice.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nNightlife, sometimes referred to as \"the night-time economy\", is a range of entertainment available and generally more popular from the late evening into the early morning. It has traditionally included venues such as pubs, bars, nightclubs, live music, concerts, cabarets, theaters, hookah lounges, cinemas, and shows. Nightlife entertainment is often more adult-oriented than daytime entertainment. It also includes informal gatherings like parties, botellón, gymkhanas, bingo, and amateur sports. In many cities, there has been an increasing focus on nightlife catering to tourists. Nightlife has become a major part of the economy and urban planning in modern cities. People who prefer to be active at night are called night owls.\nSocial movements in the 20th century, including feminism, black activism, the gay rights movement, and community action, blurred the lines between political action and broader cultural activities, making political movements a part of the nightlife. Sociologists have argued that vibrant city nightlife scenes contribute to the development of culture and political movements. David Grazian cites as examples the development of beat poetry, musical styles including bebop, urban blues, and early rock, and the importance of nightlife for the development of the gay rights movement in the United States kicked off by the riots at the Stonewall Inn nightclub in Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan, New York City. Modern cities treat nightlife as necessary to the city's marketability but also something to be managed in order to reduce activities viewed as disorderly, risky, or otherwise problematic. Urban renewal policies have increased the available possibilities for nighttime consumers and decreased non-commercial nocturnal activities outside of sanctioned festivals and concerts.\n\n\n== Art ==\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nIn literature, night is often associated with mysterious, hidden, dangerous, and clandestine activities. Rhesus is the only extant Greek tragedy where night is explicitly invoked and made an element of the story. In the play, night is a time of disorder and confusion that allows Odysseus to sneak into the Trojan camp and kill King Rhesus of Thrace. The handful of surviving Classical Greek texts that describe the nocturnal activities of women portray female freedom, especially to speak openly, male anxieties about that freedom, and magic that functions as a metaphor for nocturnal danger. Roman poets like Marcus Manilius and Aratus worked late into the night and incorporated darkness and the night sky into their writing.\nSince the Age of Enlightenment, nocturnal settings have been a frequent place for passionate chaos as a counterbalance to the rationality present during the day. In Gothic fiction, this absence of rationality offered a space for lust and terror. Ottoman literature portrayed night as a time for forbidden or unrequited love. Night and day were long depicted as opposite conditions. The electric light, the industrial revolution, and shift work brought many aspects of daily life into the night. The author Charles Dickens lived in London during the time of gas lighting and compared the unstable separation between the waking and sleeping city to the unstable separation he perceived between dream and delusion. Night in contemporary literature offers liminal settings, such as hospitals and gas stations, that contain some aspects of daily life.\n\nNight fell, while Helga Crane in the rushing swiftness of a roaring elevated train sat numb. It was as if all the bogies and goblins that had beset her unloved, unloving, and unhappy childhood had come to life with tenfold power to hurt and frighten.\n\n\n=== Film and photography ===\n\nDirectly filming at night is rarely done. Film stocks and video cameras are much less sensitive in low-light environments than the human eye. During the silent film era, many night scenes were filmed during the day in black and white. Sections of the monochrome film reel with exterior night scenes were soaked in an acidic dye that tinted the whole scene blue. \"Day for night\" is a set of cinematic techniques that simulate a night scene while filming in daylight. They include underexposing to soften the scene, using a graduated neutral-density filter to mute lighting, and setting up the artificial lighting to amplify shadows in the background.  Lower-budget films are more likely to use day for night shooting; larger-budget films are more likely to film at night with artificial lighting. Cinematographers have used tinting, filters, color balance settings, and physical lights to color night scenes blue. In low light, people experience the Purkinje effect, which causes reds to dim so that more blue is perceived. As light decreases towards total darkness, the human eye has more scotopic vision, relying more on rod cells and being less able to perceive color.\n\nNight photography can capture the natural colors of night by increasing the exposure time, or length of time captured in the photography. Longer exposures open the possibility for photographers to use light painting to selectively illuminate a scene. Digital photography can also make use of high-ISO settings, which increase the sensitivity to light, to take shorter exposure shots. This makes it possible to capture moving subjects without turning their movements into a blur.\n\n\n=== Painting ===\n\nDating back to prehistoric cave paintings, artists have used a range of symbols to denote and depict the night sky. The first widely accepted portrayal of the night sky is the Nebra sky disc created c. 1600 BC. In medieval art, astrological signs gave meaning to paintings of night scenes. Adam Elsheimer's paintings on copper plates were some of the earliest realistic depictions of the night sky.\n\nBaroque paintings typically used a darker color scheme than previous painting styles in Europe. From the 17th century, darkness took up larger areas of paintings on average. Changes in the chemical composition of the paint itself and the development of new techniques for representing light led to the tenebrism style of painting. Tenebrism used stark, realistic depictions of light contrasted with darkness to create realistic depictions of night and darkness illuminated by moonlight, candles, and lamps. The work of Baroque painters, like Caravaggio, who painted an entire studio black, was influenced by the alchemical concept of \"nigredo\", or blackness as connected to death and decomposition. Dutch Golden Age painter Rembrandt recreated the dim light cast by early street lighting by layering translucent brown glazes.\n\nImpressionists represented darkness with shades of brown and blue based on the ideas that true black was not present in nature and that black had a deadening effect on the art. Claude Monet notably avoided black paints. Vincent van Gogh used heavy outlines between panes of color in his paintings, inspired by woodblock printing in Japan. This style, called cloisonné after the metalworking technique that embedded glass between dark lines of wire, was adopted by other painters like Paul Gauguin. As night in Europe became more artificially lit, former railway worker John Atkinson Grimshaw became known for his vibrantly lit urban paintings. In the modern era, painters have variously returned to archetypal symbols to capture the awe of night or painted scenes that emphasize how the modern city separates the viewer from the night sky.\n\nNear Eastern artists initially rejected these techniques to depict shadow as hiding aspects of creation in shadows. Mughal painters quickly incorporated techniques to depict night, twilight, and mists. Under Emperor Akbar I, European materials and techniques were imported. Rajasthani paintings combined these with traditional styles and symbolism. Nayikas, depictions of women seeking romantic love, were a common subject and often included night as the setting for romance and peril. Jesuit painter Giuseppe Castiglione brought Renaissance techniques for painting light and shadow to 17th-century China. In pieces like One Hundred Famous Views of Edo, Hiroshige developed techniques to represent shadow and nocturnal light that became widespread in Japanese Meiji-era art. Known for his crowd scenes lit by fireworks, Hiroshige had a strong influence on European painters.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEarth's shadow\nNight aviation regulations in the United States\nNocturne\nOlbers's paradox\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to Night at Wikimedia Commons\n Quotations related to Night at Wikiquote\n The dictionary definition of night at Wiktionary\nInternational Night Studies Network",

Following this, the original Dutch version was made available online.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Anne Frank received a blank diary as one of her presents on 12 June 1942, her 13th birthday. According to the Anne Frank House, the red, checkered autograph book which Anne used as her diary was actually not a surprise, since she had chosen it the day before with her father when browsing a bookstore near her home. She entered a one-sentence note on her birthday, writing \"I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support\". The main diary was written from 14 June.\nOn 5 July 1942, Anne's then-16-year-old sister, Margot, received an official summons to report to a Nazi work camp in Germany, and on 6 July, Margot and Anne went into hiding with their parents Otto and Edith. They were later joined by Hermann van Pels, Otto's business partner, his wife Auguste and their teenage son Peter. Their hiding place was in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex at the back of Otto's company building in Amsterdam. Otto Frank started his business, named Opekta, in 1933. He was licensed to manufacture and sell pectin, a substance used to make jam. He stopped running his business while in hiding. But once he returned in the summer of 1945, he found his employees running it. The rooms that everyone hid in were concealed behind a movable bookcase in the same building as Opekta. Fritz Pfeffer, the dentist of their helper Miep Gies, joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: The van Pelses are known as the Van Daans, and Fritz Pfeffer as Albert Düssel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month.\nOn 6 June 1944, the Allied forces commenced the Normandy landings, in France; the group was aware of this development, and hopeful for eventual liberation. On 4 August 1944, six weeks before the Allies breached the Belgian-Dutch border, the group was discovered and deported to Nazi concentration camps. They were long thought to have been betrayed, although there are indications that their discovery may have been accidental, that the police raid had actually targeted \"ration fraud\". Of the eight people, only Otto Frank survived the war. Anne was 15 years old when she died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, in Nazi Germany. The exact date of her death is unknown, and has long been believed to be in late February or early March, a few weeks before the concentration camp was liberated by British troops on 15 April 1945.\nIn the manuscript, her original diaries are written over three extant volumes. The first volume (the red-and-white checkered autograph book) covers the period between 14 June and 5 December 1942. Since the second surviving volume (a school exercise book) begins on 22 December 1943, and ends on 17 April 1944, it is assumed that the original volume or volumes between December 1942 and December 1943 were  lost, presumably after the arrest, when the hiding place was emptied on Nazi instructions. However, this missing period is covered in the version Anne rewrote for preservation. The third existing volume (which was also a school exercise book) contains entries from 17 April to 1 August 1944, when Anne wrote for the last time three days before her arrest.\nThe manuscript, written on loose sheets of paper, was found strewn on the floor of the hiding place by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl after the family's arrest, but before their rooms were ransacked by a special department of the Amsterdam office of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Nazi intelligence agency) for which many Dutch collaborators worked. The papers were given to Otto Frank after the war, when Anne's death was confirmed in July 1945 by sisters Marianne and Rebekka Brilleslijper, who were with Margot and Anne in Bergen-Belsen.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe diary is not written in the classic forms of \"Dear Diary\" or as letters to oneself; Anne calls her diary \"Kitty\", so almost all of the letters are written to Kitty. Anne used the above-mentioned names for her annex-mates in the first volume, from 25 September 1942 until 13 November 1942, when the first notebook ends. It is believed that these names were taken from characters found in a series of popular Dutch books written by Cissy van Marxveldt.\nAnne's already budding literary ambitions were galvanized on 29 March 1944 when she heard a London radio broadcast made by the exiled Dutch Minister for Education, Art, and Science, Gerrit Bolkestein, calling for the preservation of \"ordinary documents – a diary, letters ... simple everyday material\" to create an archive for posterity as testimony to the suffering of civilians during the Nazi occupation. On 20 May 1944, she notes that she started re-drafting her diary with future readers in mind. She expanded entries and standardized them by addressing all of them to Kitty, clarified situations, prepared a list of pseudonyms, and cut scenes she thought would be of little interest or too intimate for general consumption. By the time she started the second existing volume, she was writing only to Kitty.\n\n\n== Dear Kitty ==\nFor many years there was much conjecture about the identity of or inspiration for Kitty. In 1996, the critic Sietse van der Hoek wrote that the name referred to Kitty Egyedi, a prewar friend of Anne's. Van der Hoek may have been informed by the publication A Tribute to Anne Frank (1970), prepared by the Anne Frank Foundation, which assumed a factual basis for the character in its preface by the then-chairman of the Foundation, Henri van Praag, and accentuated this with the inclusion of a group photograph that singles out Anne, Sanne Ledermann, Hanneli Goslar, and Kitty Egyedi. However, Anne does not mention Egyedi in any of her writings (in fact, the only other girl mentioned in her diary from the often reproduced photo, other than Goslar and Ledermann, is Mary Bos, whose drawings Anne dreamed about in 1944) and the only comparable example of Anne's writing un-posted letters to a real friend are two farewell letters to Jacqueline van Maarsen, from September 1942.\nTheodor Holman wrote in reply to Sietse van der Hoek that the diary entry for 28 September 1942 proved conclusively the character's fictional origin. Jacqueline van Maarsen agreed, but Otto Frank assumed his daughter had her real acquaintance in mind when she wrote to someone of the same name. Kitty Egyedi said in an interview that she was flattered by the possibility it was her, but stated:\n\nKitty became so idealized and started to lead her own life in the diary that it ceases to matter who is meant by 'Kitty'. The name ... is not meant to be me.\nOnly when Anne Frank's diaries were transcribed in the 1980s did it emerge that 'Kitty' was not unique; she was one of a group of eight recipients to whom Anne addressed the first few months of her diary entries. In some of the notes, Anne references the other names, suggesting she imagined they all knew each other. With the exception of Kitty, none of the names were of people from Anne's real-life social circle. Three of the names may be imaginary, but five of them correspond to the names of a group of friends from the novels of Cissy van Marxveldt, which Anne was reading at the time. Significantly, the novels are epistolary and include a teenage girl called 'Kitty Francken'. By the end of 1942, Anne was writing solely to her. In 1943, when she started revising and expanding her diary entries, she standardised the form and consolidated all of the recipients to just Kitty.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nAnne expressed the desire in the rewritten introduction of her diary for one person that she can call her truest friend – that is, a person to whom she could confide her deepest thoughts and feelings. She observes that she has had many \"friends\" and admirers, but (by her own definition) no true, dear friend with whom she could share her innermost thoughts. She originally thought her girl friend Jacque van Maarsen would be this person, but that was only partially successful. In an early diary passage, she remarks that she is not in love with Helmut \"Hello\" Silberberg, her suitor at that time, but considers that he might become a true friend. In hiding, she invests much time and effort into her budding romance with Peter van Pels, thinking he might evolve into that one, true friend, but that is eventually a disappointment to her in some ways, although she continues to care for him. Ultimately, it was only to Kitty that she entrusted her innermost thoughts.\nBeyond her personal relationships and aspirations, Anne refers extensively to the persecution, arrests, deportations, and disappearances of Jews, and the constant fear of discovery that permeated their lives in hiding. She often mentions the arrests of Jews and the compulsory wearing of the yellow star. There are hints of darker rumours — references to Jews \"being gassed\" — but these remain vague and uncertain within the diary. Anne's writing captures the partial, rumour-based understanding of the Holocaust typical for Jews living under Nazi occupation at the time. Even while concealed in the Annex, they knew they faced mortal danger, but the full-scale, mechanization, and ideological fury driving the genocide would not have been clear from their limited vantage point.\nIn her diary, Anne wrote of her very close relationship with her father, lack of daughterly love for her mother (with whom she felt she had nothing in common), and admiration for her sister's intelligence and sweet nature. She did not like the others much initially, particularly Auguste van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer (the latter shared her room). She was at first unimpressed by the quiet Peter; she herself was something of a self-admitted chatterbox (a source of irritation to some of the others). As time went on, however, she and Peter became very close and spent a lot of time together. After a while Anne became disappointed in Peter and on 15 July 1944, she wrote in her diary that Peter could never be a 'kindred spirit'.\n\n\n== Editorial history ==\nThere are two versions of the diary written by Anne Frank. She wrote the first version in a designated diary and two notebooks (version A), but rewrote it (version B) in 1944 after hearing on the radio that war-time diaries were to be collected to document the war period. Version B was written on loose paper, and is not identical to Version A, as parts were added and others omitted.\n\n\n=== Publication in Dutch ===\n\"...[Th]ough Anne had made it plain that she wanted to become a famous writer, she had also made it clear that she wanted to keep her diary to herself. But finally [her father] decided that publication was what Anne would have wanted.\"\nThe first transcription of Anne's diary was in German, made by Otto Frank for his friends and relatives in Switzerland, who convinced him to send it for publication. The second, a composite of Anne Frank's versions A and B as well as excerpts from her essays, became the first draft submitted for publication, with an epilogue written by a family friend explaining the fate of its author. In the spring of 1946, it came to the attention of Dr. Jan Romein and his wife Annie Romein-Verschoor, two Dutch historians. They were so moved by it that Anne Romein made unsuccessful attempts to find a publisher, which led Romein to write an article for the newspaper Het Parool:\n\nThis apparently inconsequential diary by a child, this \"de profundis\" stammered out in a child's voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence of Nuremberg put together.\nThis caught the interest of Contact Publishing in Amsterdam, who approached Otto Frank to submit a Dutch draft of the manuscript for their consideration. They offered to publish, but advised Otto Frank that Anne's candor about her emerging sexuality might offend certain conservative quarters, and suggested cuts. Further entries were also deleted. The diary – which was a combination of version A and version B – was published under the name Het Achterhuis. Dagbrieven van 14 juni 1942 tot 1 augustus 1944 (The Secret Annex. Diary Letters from 14 June 1942 to 1 August 1944) on 25 June 1947. Otto Frank later discussed this moment, \"If she had been here, Anne would have been so proud\". The book sold well; the 3,000 copies of the first edition were soon sold out, and in 1950 a sixth edition was published.\nIn 1986, a critical edition appeared, incorporating versions A and B, and based on the findings of the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation into challenges to the diary's authenticity. This was published in three volumes with a total of 714 pages.\n\n\n=== Publication in English ===\nIn 1950, the Dutch translator Rosey E. Pool made a first English translation of the diary, which was never published. At the end of 1950, another translator was found to produce an English-language version. Barbara Mooyaart-Doubleday was contracted by Vallentine Mitchell in England, and by the end of the following year, her translation was submitted, now including the deleted passages at Otto Frank's request. As well, Judith Jones, while working for the publisher Doubleday, read and recommended the Diary, pulling it out of the rejection pile. Jones recalled that she came across Frank's work in a slush pile of material that had been rejected by other publishers; she was struck by a photograph of the girl on the cover of an advance copy of the French edition. \"I read it all day\", she noted. \"When my boss returned, I told him, 'We have to publish this book.' He said, 'What? That book by that kid?'\" She brought the diary to the attention of Doubleday's New York office. \"I made the book quite important because I was so taken with it, and I felt it would have a real market in America. It's one of those seminal books that will never be forgotten\", Jones said.\nThe book appeared in the United States and in the United Kingdom in 1952, becoming a best-seller. The introduction to the English publication was written by Eleanor Roosevelt.\nIn 1989, an English edition of this appeared under the title of The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition, including Mooyaart-Doubleday's translation and Anne Frank's versions A and B, based on the Dutch critical version of 1986. A new translation by Susan Massotty, based on the original texts, was published in 1995.\nIn 2018, Ari Folman, a son of Holocaust survivors, adapted The Diary of a Young Girl into a graphic novel illustrated by David Polonsky.\n\n\n=== Other languages ===\nThe work was translated in 1950 into German and French, before it appeared in 1952 in the US in English. The critical version was also translated into Chinese. By 2014, over 35 million copies had been published, in 65 languages; as of 2019, the website of the Anne Frank House records translations in over 70 languages.\n\n\n=== Theatrical and film adaptations ===\n\"The first dramatization, written by the American author Meyer Levin, did not find a producer. Otto Frank, too, had his reservations about Levin's work...\"\n\"Otto was not much happier at first with the second dramatization, written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett. Only after the couple's reworking of the script had dragged on for two years did Otto give it his approval.\" A play by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich based on the diary won the Pulitzer Prize for 1955. A subsequent film version earned Shelley Winters an Academy Award for her performance. Winters donated her Oscar to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.\n\nThe first major adaptation to quote literal passages from the diary was 2014's Anne, authorised and initiated by the Anne Frank Foundation in Basel. After a two-year continuous run at the purpose-built Theater Amsterdam in the Netherlands, the play had productions in Germany and Israel.\nOther adaptations of the diary include a version by Wendy Kesselman from 1997. Alix Sobler's 2014 The Secret Annex imagined the fate of the diary in a world in which Anne Frank survives the Holocaust.\nThe first German film version of the diary, written by Fred Breinersdorfer, was released by NBCUniversal in 2016. The film is derived from the 2014 Dutch stage production.\nIn 2021, Ari Folman directed Where Is Anne Frank, an animated magical realism film based on Frank's life, with the animation styled after Polonsky's illustrations for Folman's 2018 graphic novel adaptation of The Diary of a Young Girl. The film centers on Kitty—Frank's imaginary friend to whom she addressed her diary—coming to life in 21st century Netherlands; as Kitty learns of the Frank family's fates in the Holocaust, she helps a number of refugees seek asylum, aware of how similar their plight is to that of the persecuted Jews of WWII.\nIn 2025, Andrew Fox and Joel Sinensky produced Slam Frank, a satirical hip-hop musical that imagines Frank and other characters as belonging to other marginalized groups.\n\n\n=== Censored material ===\nIn 1986, the Dutch Institute for War Documentation published the \"Critical Edition\" of the diary, containing comparisons from all known versions, both edited and unedited, discussion asserting the diary's authentication, and additional historical information relating to the family and the diary itself. It also included sections of Anne's diaries which had previously been edited out, containing passages on pondering her sexuality, references to touching her friend's breasts, and her thoughts on menstruation. An edition was published in 1995 which included Anne's description of exploring of her own genitalia and her confusion regarding sex and childbirth, having previously been edited out by the original publisher.\nCornelis Suijk – a former director of the Anne Frank Foundation and president of the U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation – announced in 1999 that he was in possession of five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother. Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.\nIn May 2018, Frank van Vree, the director of the Niod Institute along with others, discovered some unseen excerpts from the diary that Anne had previously covered up with a piece of brown paper. The excerpts discuss sexuality, prostitution, and also include jokes Anne herself described as \"dirty\" that she heard from the other residents of the Secret Annex and elsewhere. Van Vree said \"anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile\", before adding, \"the 'dirty' jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all an ordinary girl\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn the 1960s, Otto Frank recalled his feelings when reading the diary for the first time, \"For me, it was a revelation. There, was revealed a completely different Anne to the child that I had lost. I had no idea of the depths of her thoughts and feelings.\" Michael Berenbaum, former director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, wrote, \"Precocious in style and insight, it traces her emotional growth amid adversity. In it, she wrote, 'In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.'\"\nIn 2009, the notebooks of the diary were submitted by the Netherlands and included in UNESCO's Memory of the World international register.\n\n\n=== Criticism of popularity ===\nDara Horn, herself a descendant of Holocaust survivors, laments that Anne Frank's account ends with the thought that people are good at heart and the note that Frank died \"peacefully\" of typhus, shortly before Frank encounters very evil people who took her off at gunpoint to be murdered. Horn feels this allows readers to be absolved of responsibility, and that the popularity of the book derives from its lack of any depiction of the horrors of Nazi death camps. She points to accounts of victims who had more typical experiences, such as Zalmen Gradowski (reportedly one of the inspirations for the film Son of Saul), who was forced to strip his fellow Jews on the way into the gas chambers, with vivid accounts of their last words and actions, and watching the bodies burn during the forced cleanup process. Horn also points out the relative lack of international attention paid to the accounts of survivors of the Holocaust, speculating Frank's diary would not have been popular had she survived, and to ironic dismissal of living Jews, such as an employee of the Anne Frank museum who was told he could not wear a yarmulke.\n\n\n=== Vandalism ===\nIn February 2014, authorities discovered that 265 copies of the Frank diary and other material related to the Holocaust were vandalized across 31 public libraries in Tokyo. The Simon Wiesenthal Center expressed \"its shock and deep concern\" and, in response, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga called the vandalism \"shameful.\" Israel donated 300 copies of Anne Frank's diary to replace the vandalized copies. An anonymous donor using the pseudonym \"Chiune Sugihara\" donated two boxes of books pertaining to the Holocaust to the Tokyo Metropolitan Library. Police arrested an unemployed man in March 2014. In June, prosecutors decided not to indict the suspect after he was found to be mentally incompetent. According to librarians in Tokyo, books relating to the Holocaust such as the diary and Man's Search for Meaning attract people with mental disorders and are subject to occasional vandalism.\n\n\n=== Bans ===\nIn 2009, the group Hezbollah called to ban the book in Lebanese schools, arguing that the text was an apology to Jews, Zionism and Israel.\nIn 2010, the Culpeper County, Virginia, school system banned the 50th Anniversary \"Definitive Edition\" of Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl, due to \"complaints about its sexual content and homosexual themes.\" This version \"includes passages previously excluded from the widely read original edition.... Some of the extra passages detail her emerging sexual desires; others include unflattering descriptions of her mother and other people living together.\" After consideration, it was decided a copy of the newer version would remain in the library and classes would revert to using the older version.\nIn 2013, a similar controversy arose in a 7th grade setting in Northville, Michigan, focusing on explicit passages about sexuality. The mother behind the formal complaint referred to portions of the book as \"pretty pornographic.\"\nIn 2010, the American Library Association stated that there have been six challenges to the book in the United States since it started keeping records on bans and challenges in 1990, and that \"[m]ost of the concerns were about sexually explicit material\".\nIn 2023, a Texas teacher was fired after assigning an illustrated adaptation of Anne Frank’s diary to her middle school class, in a move that some are calling “a political attack on truth”. The eighth-grade school teacher was fired after officials with Hamshire-Fannett independent school district said the teacher presented the “inappropriate” book to students, reported KFDM.\n\n\n== Authenticity ==\nAs reported in The New York Times in 2015, \"When Otto Frank first published his daughter's red-checked diary and notebooks, he wrote a prologue assuring readers that the book mostly contained her words\". Although many Holocaust deniers, such as Robert Faurisson, have claimed that Anne Frank's diary was fabricated, critical and forensic studies of the text and the original manuscript have supported its authenticity.\nThe Netherlands Institute for War Documentation commissioned a forensic study of the manuscripts after the death of Otto Frank in 1980. The material composition of the original notebooks and ink, and the handwriting found within them and the loose version were extensively examined. In 1986, the results were published: the handwriting attributed to Anne Frank was positively matched with contemporary samples of Anne Frank's handwriting, and the paper, ink, and glue found in the diaries and loose papers were consistent with materials available in Amsterdam during the period in which the diary was written.\nThe survey of her manuscripts compared an unabridged transcription of Anne Frank's original notebooks with the entries she expanded and clarified on loose paper in a rewritten form and the final edit as it was prepared for the English translation. The investigation revealed that all of the entries in the published version were accurate transcriptions of manuscript entries in Anne Frank's handwriting, and that they represented approximately a third of the material collected for the initial publication. The magnitude of edits to the text is comparable to other historical diaries such as those of Katherine Mansfield, Anaïs Nin and Leo Tolstoy in that the authors revised their diaries after the initial draft, and the material was posthumously edited into a publishable manuscript by their respective executors, only to be superseded in later decades by unexpurgated editions prepared by scholars.\nNazi sympathizer Ernst Römer accused Otto Frank of editing and fabricating parts of Anne's diary in 1980. Otto filed a lawsuit against him, and the court ruled that the diary was authentic. Römer ordered a second investigation, involving Hamburg's Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt (BKA)). That investigation concluded that parts of the diary were written with ballpoint pen ink, which was not generally available in the 1940s. (The first ball point pens were produced in the 1940s but they did not become generally available until the 1950s.) Reporters were unable to reach out to Otto Frank for questions as he died around the time of the discovery.\nHowever, the ballpoint pen theory has mostly been discredited. There are only three instances where a ballpoint pen was used in the diary: on two scraps of paper that were added into the diary at a later date (the contents of which have never been considered Anne Frank's writing and are usually attributed to being Otto Frank's notes) and in the page numbers (also probably added by Otto Frank while organizing the writings and papers).\n\n\n== Copyright and ownership of the originals ==\n\n\n=== Anne Frank Fonds ===\nIn his will, Otto Frank bequeathed the original manuscripts to the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation. The copyright however belonged to the Anne Frank Fonds, a Switzerland-based foundation based in Basel which was the sole inheritor of Frank after his death in 1980. The organization is dedicated to the publication of the diary.\n\n\n=== Expiration ===\nAccording to the copyright laws in the European Union, as a general rule, rights of authors end seventy years after their death. Hence, the copyright of the diary expired on 1 January 2016. In the Netherlands, for the original publication of 1947 (containing parts of both versions of Anne Frank's writing), as well as a version published in 1986 (containing both versions completely), copyright initially would have expired not 50 years after the death of Anne Frank (1996), but 50 years after publication, as a result of a provision specific for posthumously published works (1997 and 2036, respectively).\nWhen the copyright duration was extended to 70 years in 1995 – implementing the EU Copyright Term Directive – the special rule regarding posthumous works was abolished, but transitional provisions made sure that this could never lead to shortening of the copyright term, thus leading to expiration of the copyright term for the first version on 1 January 2016, but for the new material published in 1986 in 2036.\nThe original Dutch version was made available online by University of Nantes lecturer Olivier Ertzscheid and former member of the French Parliament Isabelle Attard.\n\n\n=== Authorship ===\nIn 2015, the Anne Frank Fonds made an announcement, as reported in The New York Times, that the 1947 edition of the diary was co-authored by Otto Frank. According to Yves Kugelmann, a member of the board of the foundation, their expert advice was that Otto had created a new work by editing, merging, and trimming entries from the diary and notebooks and reshaping them into a \"kind of collage\", which had created a new copyright. Agnès Tricoire, a lawyer specializing in intellectual property rights, responded by warning the foundation to \"think very carefully about the consequences\". She added \"If you follow their arguments, it means that they have lied for years about the fact that it was only written by Anne Frank.\"\nThe foundation also relies on the fact that another editor, Mirjam Pressler, had revised the text and added 25 percent more material drawn from the diary for a \"definitive edition\" in 1991, and Pressler was still alive in 2015, thus creating another long-lasting new copyright. The move was seen as an attempt to extend the copyright term. Attard had criticised this action only as a \"question of money\", and Ertzscheid concurred, stating, \"It [the diary] belongs to everyone. And it is up to each to measure its importance.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of posthumous publications of Holocaust victims\nList of best-selling books\nList of people associated with Anne Frank\nLe Monde's 100 Books of the Century\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n=== Copyright and ownership dispute ===\nLebovic, Matt (18 December 2014). \"A most unseemly battle over the legacy of Anne Frank (In feud with Amsterdam museum, copyright holders are using final year before diaries enter the public domain to push a play, a TV docudrama, films, apps and an archive)\".

Another edition, with revisions by his grandson Seán Hemingway, was published in 2009.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn November 1956, Hemingway recovered two small steamer trunks containing his notebooks from the 1920s that he had stored in the basement of the Hôtel Ritz Paris in March 1928. Hemingway's friend and biographer A. E. Hotchner, who was with him in Paris in 1956, recalled the event:\n\nIn 1956, Ernest and I were having lunch at the Hôtel Ritz Paris with Charles Ritz, the hotel's chairman, when Charley asked if Ernest was aware that a trunk of his was in the basement storage room, left there in 1930. Ernest did not remember storing the trunk but he did recall that in the 1920s Louis Vuitton had made a special trunk for him. Ernest had wondered what had become of it. Charley had the trunk brought up to his office, and after lunch Ernest opened it. It was filled with a ragtag collection of clothes, menus, receipts, memos, hunting and fishing paraphernalia, skiing equipment, racing forms, correspondence and, on the bottom, something that elicited a joyful reaction from Ernest: 'The notebooks! So that's where they were! Enfin!' There were two stacks of lined notebooks like the ones used by schoolchildren in Paris when he lived there in the '20s. Ernest had filled them with his careful handwriting while sitting in his favorite café, nursing a café crème. The notebooks described the places, the people, the events of his penurious life.Hotchner, A. E. (2009-07-19). \"Don't Touch 'A Moveable Feast'\". The New York Times. Retrieved 2015-12-08.\nHemingway had the notebooks transcribed and began to turn them into the memoir that would eventually become A Moveable Feast. After Hemingway's death in 1961, his widow Mary Hemingway made final copy-edits to the manuscript before its publication in 1964. In a \"note\" in the 1964 edition of the work, she wrote:\n\nErnest started writing this book in Cuba in the autumn of 1957, worked on it in Ketchum, Idaho, in the winter of 1958-59, took it with him to Spain ... in April, 1959, and brought it back with him to Cuba and then to Ketchum late that fall. He finished the book in the spring of 1960 in Cuba.... He made some revisions ... in the fall of 1960 in Ketchum. It concerns the years 1921 to 1926 in Paris. - M.H.\n\nResearchers, including literary scholar Gerry Brenner from the University of Montana, examined Hemingway's notes and initial drafts of A Moveable Feast in the collection the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts. In a 1982 paper titled \"Are We Going to Hemingway's Feast?\", Brenner documented Mary Hemingway's editing process and questioned its validity. He concluded that some of her changes were misguided and that others had questionable motives.  Brenner suggested that the changes contradicted Mary's \"hands off\" policy as executor. Brenner stated that Mary had changed the order of the chapters in Hemingway's final draft to \"preserve chronology\" and disrupted the juxtaposition of character sketches of individuals like Sylvia Beach, owner of the bookstore Shakespeare and Company, and Gertrude Stein. Mary reinserted a chapter titled \"Birth of a New School\", which Hemingway had dropped from his draft. Brenner's most serious charge was that the 1964 book deleted Hemingway's lengthy apology to Hadley, his first wife, which had appeared in various forms in every draft of the book. Brenner suggested that Mary deleted it because it impugned her role as wife.\nBiographer Hotchner said that he had received a near final draft of A Moveable Feast in 1959, and that the version Mary Hemingway published was essentially the draft he had read then. In Hotchner's view, the original 1964 publication was the version that Hemingway intended and Mary Hemingway carried out Ernest's intentions. Hotchner described Hemingway's memoir as \"a serious work\", which Hemingway \"certainly intended it for publication\", and contended: \"Because Mary was busy with matters relating to Ernest's estate, she had little involvement with the book.... What I read on the plane coming back from Cuba [in 1959] was essentially what was published. There was no extra chapter created by Mary.\n\n\n== Title ==\n\nThe title, A Moveable Feast (a play on words for the term used for a holy day for which the date is not fixed), was suggested by Hemingway's friend and biographer A. E. Hotchner, who remembered Hemingway using the term in 1950. Hotchner's recollection of Hemingway's words became the source of the epigraph on the title page for the 1964 edition.\n\n\n== Chapters ==\nThe 1964 edition of Hemingway's memoir consists of a preface by Hemingway (pg. ix), a \"note\" by his widow (pg. xi), and 20 independent chapters or sections. Each one can be read as a stand-alone piece or entity, not dependent upon the context of the whole work, nor necessarily arranged in any chronological order:\n\n\"A Good Café on the Place St.-Michel\"\n\"Miss Stein Instructs\"\n\"Une Génération Perdue\"\n\"Shakespeare and Company\"\n\"People of the Seine\"\n\"A False Spring\"\n\"The End of an Avocation\"\n\"Hunger Was Good Discipline\"\n\"Ford Madox Ford and the Devil's Disciple\"\n\"Birth of a New School\"\n\"With Pascin at the Dôme\"\n\"Ezra Pound and His Bel Esprit\"\n\"A Strange Enough Ending\"\n\"The Man Who Was Marked for Death\"\n\"Evan Shipman at the Lilas\"\n\"An Agent of Evil\"\n\"Scott Fitzgerald\"\n\"Hawks Do Not Share\"\n\"A Matter of Measurements\"\n\"There Is Never Any End to Paris\"\n\n\n== Publishing history ==\nThe first edition was edited from Hemingway's manuscripts and notes by Mary Hemingway, his fourth wife and widow, and published posthumously in 1964, three years after Hemingway's death.\nIn 2009, another edition, titled the \"Restored Edition\", was published by Hemingway's grandson Seán Hemingway, curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,. The 2009 edition made numerous changes:\n\nThe introductory letter by Hemingway, pieced together from various fragments by Mary Hemingway, was removed.\nThe chapter called \"Birth of a New School\" and sections of \"Ezra Pound and the Measuring Worm\" and \"There Is Never Any End to Paris\" (which has been renamed as \"Winter in Schruns\" and moved to chapter 16) included earlier omissions. The unpublished \"The Pilot Fish and the Rich\" was added.\nChapter 7 (\"Shakespeare and Company\") became chapter 3; chapter 16 (\"Nada y Pues Nada\") moved to the end of the book as an \"Additional Paris Sketch\".\nHemingway's use of the second person was restored in many places, a change that Seán said \"brings the reader into the story\".\nFrom the new foreword by Patrick Hemingway:\n\n\"[H]ere is the last bit of professional writing by my father, the true foreword to A Moveable Feast: 'This book contains material from the remises of my memory and of my heart.  Even if the one has been tampered with and the other does not exist'.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Bennett Cerf ===\nIn 1964, Sheilah Graham appeared as a contestant on the CBS Television series What's My Line?, 23 years after the death of her boyfriend F. Scott Fitzgerald. This was telecast live on June 7, 1964, when A Moveable Feast was on bestseller lists.  Bennett Cerf, the head of Random House who had known Sylvia Beach personally, and who was a regular panelist on the network television series, initiated the topic of Hemingway's new bestselling book.\n\nCerf: Miss Graham, after, after this new Hemingway book, I hope you're going to answer some of the remarks that were made in that book about Scott Fitzgerald.\nGraham: Well, I would like to. I'm not sure I'm the right person, although I am the right person...\nCerf: Ah, you certainly are the right person.\nGraham: ... to answer that. I thought it was rather dreadfully cruel to Scott Fitzgerald and, untrue in, uh, in certain areas, shall we say.\nCerf: Well, I hope you'll straighten the record.\n\nGraham: [unintelligible] ... try\n\n\n=== Reactions to the 2009 edition ===\nA.E. Hotchner alleged, among his other criticisms of the 2009 edition, that Seán Hemingway had edited it, in part, to exclude references to his grandmother (Hemingway's second wife Pauline Pfeiffer) that he found less than flattering. On the 2009 edition, Hotchner said: \"Ernest was very protective of the words he wrote, words that gave the literary world a new style of writing. Surely he has the right to have these words protected against frivolous incursion, like this reworked volume that should be called \"A Moveable Book\".\nOther critics have found fault with some of Seán Hemingway's editorial changes. Irene Gammel wrote about the new edition: \"Ethically and pragmatically, restoring an author's original intent is a slippery slope when the published text has stood the test of time and when edits have been approved by authors or their legal representatives.\" Pointing to the complexity of authorship, she concluded that \"Mary's version should be considered the definitive one, while the 'restored' version provides access to important unpublished contextual sources that illuminate the evolution of the 1964 edition.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Adaptations ===\nOn September 15, 2009, Variety reported that Mariel Hemingway, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, had acquired the film and television rights to the memoir with American film producer John Goldstone. The Hollywood Reporter wrote in March 2011 that Jeff Baena was writing a film adaptation for an indie production. In 2019, it was reported that a television series was being developed through Village Roadshow Entertainment Group, but there was no planned release date.\n\n\n=== Cultural references ===\n\n\n==== In films ====\nThe comedy film The Moderns (1988) brings the characters of A Moveable Feast to life while spoofing the pretense of the Lost Generation.\nThe book is featured in the movie City of Angels (1998) during an exchange between Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.\nWoody Allen's 2011 film Midnight in Paris is set in the Paris of the 1920s as portrayed in Hemingway's book, and the movie features the Owen Wilson character interacting with Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and uses the phrase \"a moveable feast\" in two instances.\nThe Words (2012) uses an excerpt from A Moveable Feast to represent a book manuscript found in an old messenger bag.\nIn the American movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), one of the books on the shelf in the character Steve Rogers' apartment is Hemingway's A Moveable Feast.\nIn the American film French Postcards (1979), a character quotes the epigraph from the book in order to convince a fellow American student who is studying in France with him to not only study, but enjoy life in Paris.\nIn the American comedy film Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008), a stripper named Tits Hemingway says she got the latter part of her name because her favorite novel is A Moveable Feast.\n\n\n==== In literature ====\nThe writer Enrique Vila-Matas named his book Never Any End to Paris (2003) after the final chapter of Hemingway's work.\n\n\n==== In stage performances ====\nIn his stand-up performances in the late 1960s, Woody Allen performed a routine that referenced the recently published book and described imaginary times spent with Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, and Gertrude Stein with the recurring punch line: \"And Hemingway punched me in the mouth.\"\n\n\n=== Revival in France ===\nA Moveable Feast became a bestseller in France following the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. In the context of the attacks, the book's French-language title, Paris est une fête, was seen as a symbol of defiance and celebration. Bookstore sales of the volume surged and copies of the book appeared in makeshift memorials across the city in honor of victims of the attacks.\n\n\n=== Hemingway's wine ===\nIn A Moveable Feast, Hemingway described what life was like for aspiring writers in 1920s Paris. In addition to writing about his friendships, marriage, and writing routine in Parisian cafes, Hemingway also discussed his love of good wine, noting the different wines he and his friends enjoyed with their meals.\n\nSancerre: A False Spring, \"Another day later that year when we had come back from one of our voyages and had good luck at some track again we stopped at Prunier's on the way home, going in to sit at the bar after looking at the clearly priced wonders in the window. We had oysters and crab mexicane with glasses of Sancerre.\"\nMâcon: Scott Fitzgerald, \"We had a marvellous lunch from the hotel at Lyon, an excellent truffled roast chicken, delicious bread and white Mâcon wine and Scott was very happy when we drank the white Maconnais at each of our stops. At Mâcon I had bought four more bottles of excellent wine which I uncorked as we needed them.\"\nCorsican: With Pascin at the Dôme, \"At home, over the sawmill, we had a Corsican wine that had a great authority and a low price. It was a very Corsican wine and you could dilute it by half with water and still receive its message.\"\nCahors: With Pascin at the Dôme, \"At the Negre de Toulouse we drank the good Cahors wine from the quarter, the half or the full carafe, usually diluting it about one-third with water...In Paris, then, you could live very well on almost nothing and by skipping meals occasionally and never buying any new clothes, you could save and have luxuries.\"\nIn September 2020, Chiswick Book Festival featured a wine and literature event celebrating Hemingway's wine in A Moveable Feast presented by Victoria Daskal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHotchner, A.E.

    "description": "Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire (c. 550–330 BC). It is situated in the plains of Marvdasht, encircled by the southern Zagros Mountains, Fars province of Iran. It is one of the key Iranian cultural heritage sites and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BC. The city, acting as a major center for the empire, housed a palace complex and citadel designed to serve as the focal point for governance and ceremonial activities. It exemplifies the Achaemenid style of architecture. The complex was taken by the army of Alexander the Great in 330 BC, and soon after, its wooden parts were completely destroyed by fire. According to one theory Alexander deliberately set fire to Persepolis to avenge the destruction of Athens by the Persians, second theory is that it was at the urging of Thaïs, a courtesan, during a feast when Alexander was intoxicated.\nThe function of Persepolis remains unclear. It was not one of the largest cities in ancient Iran, let alone the rest of the empire, but appears to have been a grand ceremonial complex that was only occupied seasonally; the complex was raised high on a walled platform, with five \"palaces\" or halls of varying size, and grand entrances. It is still not entirely clear where the king's private quarters actually were.

    "full_narrative": "Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire (c. 550–330 BC). It is situated in the plains of Marvdasht, encircled by the southern Zagros Mountains, Fars province of Iran. It is one of the key Iranian cultural heritage sites and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BC. The city, acting as a major center for the empire, housed a palace complex and citadel designed to serve as the focal point for governance and ceremonial activities. It exemplifies the Achaemenid style of architecture. The complex was taken by the army of Alexander the Great in 330 BC, and soon after, its wooden parts were completely destroyed by fire. According to one theory Alexander deliberately set fire to Persepolis to avenge the destruction of Athens by the Persians, second theory is that it was at the urging of Thaïs, a courtesan, during a feast when Alexander was intoxicated.\nThe function of Persepolis remains unclear. It was not one of the largest cities in ancient Iran, let alone the rest of the empire, but appears to have been a grand ceremonial complex that was only occupied seasonally; the complex was raised high on a walled platform, with five \"palaces\" or halls of varying size, and grand entrances. It is still not entirely clear where the king's private quarters actually were. Until recently, most archaeologists held that it was primarily used for celebrating Nowruz, the Persian New Year, held at the spring equinox, which is still an important annual festivity in Iran. The Iranian nobility and the tributary parts of the empire came to present gifts to the king, as represented in the stairway reliefs. It is also unclear what permanent structures there were outside the palace complex; it may be better to think of Persepolis as only one complex rather than a \"city\" in the usual sense.\nThe exploration of Persepolis from the early 17th century led to the modern rediscovery of cuneiform writing and, from detailed studies of the trilingual Achaemenid royal inscriptions found on the ruins, the initial decipherment of cuneiform in the early 19th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nPersepolis is derived from the Greek Περσέπολις, Persepolis, a compound of Pérsēs (Πέρσης) and pólis (πόλις, together meaning \"the Persian city\" or \"the city of the Persians\"). To the ancient Persians, the city was known as Pārsa (Old Persian: 𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿), which is also the word for the region of Persia.\n\nAn inscription left in 311 AD by Sasanian Prince Shapur Sakanshah, the son of Hormizd II, refers to the site as Sad-stūn, meaning \"Hundred Pillars\". Because medieval Persians attributed the site to Jamshid, a king from Iranian mythology, it has been referred to as Takht-e-Jamshid (Persian: تخت جمشید, Taxt e Jamšīd; [ˌtæxtedʒæmˈʃiːd]), literally meaning \"Throne of Jamshid\". Another name given to the site in the medieval period was Čehel Menâr (Persian: چهل منار, \"Forty Minarets\"), transcribed as Chilminara in De Silva Figueroa and as Chilminar in early English sources.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nArchaeological evidence shows that the earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BC. André Godard, the French archaeologist who excavated Persepolis in the early 1930s, believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site of Persepolis, but that it was Darius I who built the terrace and the palaces. Inscriptions on these buildings support the belief that they were constructed by Darius.\n\nWith Darius I, the sceptre passed to a new branch of the royal house. The country's true capitals were Susa, Babylon and Ecbatana. This may be why the Greeks were not acquainted with the city until Alexander the Great took and plundered it.\nDarius I's construction of Persepolis was carried out parallel to that of the Palace of Susa. According to Gene R. Garthwaite, the Susa Palace served as Darius' model for Persepolis. Darius I ordered the construction of the Apadana and the Council Hall (Tripylon or the \"Triple Gate\"), as well as the main imperial Treasury and its surroundings. These were completed during the reign of his son, Xerxes I. Further construction of the buildings on the terrace continued until the downfall of the Achaemenid Empire. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the Greek historian Ctesias mentioned that Darius I's grave was in a cliff face that could be reached with an apparatus of ropes.\nAround 519 BCE, construction of a broad stairway was begun. Grey limestone was the main building material used at Persepolis. The uneven plan of the terrace, including the foundation, acted like a castle, whose angled walls enabled its defenders to target any section of the external front.\n\n\n=== Destruction ===\nAfter invading Achaemenid Persia in 330 BCE, Alexander the Great sent the main force of his army to Persepolis by the Royal Road. Diodorus Siculus writes that on his way to the city, Alexander and his army were met by 800 Greek artisans who had been captured by the Persians. Most were elderly and suffered some form of mutilation, such as a missing hand or foot. They explained to Alexander the Persians wanted to take advantage of their skills in the city but handicapped them so they could not easily escape. Alexander and his staff were disturbed by the story and provided the artisans with clothing and provisions before continuing on to Persepolis. Diodorus does not cite this as a reason for the destruction of Persepolis, but it is possible Alexander started to see the city in a negative light after this encounter.\nUpon reaching the city, Alexander stormed the Persian Gates, a pass through Zagros Mountains. There, Ariobarzanes of Persis successfully ambushed Alexander the Great's army, inflicting heavy casualties. After being held off for 31 days, Alexander the Great outflanked and destroyed the defenders. Ariobarzanes himself was killed either during the battle or during the retreat to Persepolis. Some sources indicate that the Persians were betrayed by a captured tribal chief who showed the Macedonians an alternate path that allowed them to outflank Ariobarzanes in a reversal of Thermopylae. After several months, Alexander allowed his troops to loot Persepolis.\n\nAround that time, a fire burned \"the palaces\" or \"the palace\".\n\nIt is believed that the fire which destroyed Persepolis started from Hadish Palace, which was the living quarters of Xerxes I, and spread to the rest of the city. It is not clear if the fire was an accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the second Persian invasion of Greece. Many historians argue that, while Alexander's army celebrated with a symposium, they decided to take revenge against the Persians. If that is so, then the destruction of Persepolis could be both an accident and a case of revenge. The fire may also have had the political purpose of destroying an iconic symbol of the Persian monarchy that might have become a focus for Persian resistance.\nSeveral, much later, Greek and Roman accounts (including Arrian, Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus) describe that the burning was the idea of Thaïs, mistress of Alexander's general Ptolemy I Soter, and possibly of Alexander himself. She is said to have suggested it during a very drunken celebration, according to some accounts to revenge the destruction of Greek sanctuaries (she was from Athens), and either she or Alexander himself set the fire going.\nThe Book of Arda Wiraz, a Zoroastrian work composed in the 3rd or 4th century, describes Persepolis' archives as containing \"all the Avesta and Zend, written upon prepared cow-skins, and with gold ink\", which were destroyed. Indeed, in his Chronology of the Ancient Nations, the native Iranian writer Biruni indicates unavailability of certain native Iranian historiographical sources in the post-Achaemenid era, especially during the Parthian Empire. He adds: \"[Alexander] burned the whole of Persepolis as revenge to the Persians, because it seems the Persian King Xerxes had burnt the Greek City of Athens around 150 years ago. People say that, even at the present time, the traces of fire are visible in some places.\"\nOn the upside, the fire that destroyed those texts may have preserved the Persepolis Administrative Archives by preventing them from being lost over time to natural and man-made events. According to archaeological evidence, the partial burning of Persepolis did not damage what are now referred to as the Persepolis Fortification Archive tablets, but rather may have caused the eventual collapse of the upper part of the northern fortification wall, preserving the tablets until their recovery by the Oriental Institute's archaeologists.\n\n\n=== After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire ===\nIn 316 BC, Persepolis was still the capital of Persia as a province of the great Macedonian Empire (see Diodorus Siculus xix, 21 seq., 46; probably after Hieronymus of Cardia, who was living about 326). The city must have gradually declined in the course of time. The lower city at the foot of the imperial city might have survived for a longer time; but the ruins of the Achaemenids remained as a witness to its ancient glory.\nThe nearby Estakhr gained prominence as a separate city very shortly after the decline of Persepolis. It appears that much of Persepolis' rubble was used for the building of Istakhr. At the time of the Muslim invasion of Persia, Estakhr offered a desperate resistance. It was still a place of considerable importance in the first century of Islam, although its greatness was speedily eclipsed by the new metropolis of Shiraz. In the 10th century, Estakhr dwindled to insignificance. During the following centuries, Estakhr gradually declined, until it ceased to exist as a city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPersepolis is near the small river Pulvar, which flows into the Kur River. The site includes a 125,000 m2 (1,350,000 sq ft) terrace, partly artificially constructed and partly cut out of a mountain, with its east side leaning on Rahmat Mountain.\n\n\n== Archaeological research ==\n\nOdoric of Pordenone may have passed through Persepolis on his way to China in 1320, although he mentioned only a great, ruined city called \"Comerum\". In 1474, Giosafat Barbaro visited the ruins of Persepolis, which he incorrectly thought were of Jewish origin. Hakluyt's Voyages included a general account of the ruins of Persepolis attributed to an English merchant who visited Iran in 1568. António de Gouveia from Portugal wrote about cuneiform inscriptions following his visit in 1602. His report on the ruins of Persepolis was published as part of his Relaçam in 1611.\nIn 1618, García de Silva Figueroa, King Philip III of Spain's ambassador to the court of Abbas I, the Safavid monarch, was the first Western traveler to link the site known in Iran as \"Chehel Minar\" as the site known from Classical authors as Persepolis.\nPietro Della Valle visited Persepolis in 1621, and noticed that only 25 of the 72 original columns were still standing, due to either vandalism or natural processes. The Dutch traveler Cornelis de Bruijn visited Persepolis in 1704.\n\nThe fruitful region was covered with villages until its frightful devastation in the 18th century; and even now it is, comparatively speaking, well cultivated. The Castle of Estakhr played a conspicuous part as a strong fortress, several times, during the Muslim period. It was the middlemost and the highest of the three steep crags which rise from the valley of the Kur, at some distance to the west or northwest of the necropolis of Naqsh-e Rustam.\nThe French voyagers Eugène Flandin and Pascal Coste are among the first to provide not only a literary review of the structure of Persepolis, but also to create some of the best and earliest visual depictions of its structure. In their publications in Paris, in 1881 and 1882, titled Voyages en Perse de MM. Eugene Flanin peintre et Pascal Coste architecte, the authors provided some 350 ground breaking illustrations of Persepolis. French influence and interest in Persia's archaeological findings continued after the accession of Reza Shah, when André Godard became the first director of the archeological service of Iran.\nIn the 1800s, a variety of amateur digging occurred at the site, in some cases on a large scale.\nThe first scientific excavations at Persepolis were carried out by Ernst Herzfeld and Erich Schmidt representing the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. They conducted excavations for eight seasons, beginning in 1930, and included other nearby sites.\n\nHerzfeld believed that the reasons behind the construction of Persepolis were the need for a majestic atmosphere, a symbol for the empire, and to celebrate special events, especially the Nowruz. For historical reasons, Persepolis was built where the Achaemenid dynasty was founded, although it was not the center of the empire at that time.\nExcavations of plaque fragments hint at a scene with a contest between Herakles and Apollo, dubbed A Greek painting at Persepolis.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nPersepolitan architecture is noted for its use of the Persian column, which was probably based on earlier wooden columns.\nThe buildings at Persepolis include three general groupings: military quarters, the treasury, and the reception halls and occasional houses for the King. Noted structures include the Great Stairway, the Gate of All Nations, the Apadana, the Hall of a Hundred Columns, the Tripylon Hall and the Tachara, the Hadish Palace, the Palace of Artaxerxes III, the Imperial Treasury, the Royal Stables, and the Chariot House.\n\n\n== Remains ==\n\nRuins of a number of colossal buildings exist on the terrace. All are constructed of dark-grey marble. Fifteen of their pillars stand intact. Three more pillars have been re-erected since 1970. Several of the buildings were never finished.\nBehind the compound at Persepolis, there are three sepulchers hewn out of the rock in the hillside. \n\n\n=== The Gate of All Nations ===\n\nThe Gate of All Nations, referring to subjects of the empire, consisted of a grand hall that was a square of approximately 25 m (82 ft) in length, with four columns and its entrance on the Western Wall.\n\n\n=== The Apadana Palace ===\nDarius I built the greatest palace at Persepolis on the western side of platform. This palace was called the Apadana. The King of Kings used it for official audiences.\nFoundation tablets of gold and silver were found in two deposition boxes in the foundations of the Palace. They contained an inscription by Darius in Old Persian cuneiform, which describes the extent of his Empire in broad geographical terms, and is known as the DPh inscription:\n\nDarius the great king, king of kings, king of countries, son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenid. King Darius says: This is the kingdom which I hold, from the Sacae who are beyond Sogdia, to Kush, and from Sind (Old Persian: 𐏃𐎡𐎭𐎢𐎺, romanized: Hidauv, locative of Hiduš, i.e. \"Indus valley\") to Lydia (Old Persian: Spardâ) – [this is] what Ahuramazda, the greatest of gods, bestowed upon me. May Ahuramazda protect me and my royal house!\nThe reliefs on the staircases allow one to observe the people from across the empire in their traditional dress, and even the king himself, \"down to the smallest detail\".\n\n\n==== Apadana Palace coin hoard ====\n\nThe Apadana hoard is a hoard of coins that were discovered under the stone boxes containing the foundation tablets of the Apadana Palace in Persepolis. The coins were discovered in excavations in 1933 by Erich Schmidt, in two deposits, each deposit under the two deposition boxes that were found. The deposition of this hoard is dated to c. 515 BC. The coins consisted in eight gold lightweight Croeseids, a tetradrachm of Abdera, a stater of Aegina and three double-sigloi from Cyprus. The Croeseids were found in very fresh condition, confirming that they had been recently minted under Achaemenid rule. The deposit did not have any Darics and Sigloi, which also suggests strongly that these coins typical of Achaemenid coinage only started to be minted later, after the foundation of the Apadana Palace.\n\n\n=== The Throne Hall ===\n\nNext to the Apadana, second largest building of the Terrace and the final edifices, is the Throne Hall or the Imperial Army's Hall of Honor (also called the Hundred-Columns Palace). This 70 m2 × 70 m2 (750 sq ft × 750 sq ft) hall was started by Xerxes I and completed by his son Artaxerxes I by the end of the fifth century BC. Its eight stone doorways are decorated on the south and north with reliefs of throne scenes and on the east and west with scenes depicting the king in combat with monsters. Two colossal stone bulls flank the northern portico. The head of one of the bulls now resides in the Oriental Institute in Chicago and a column base from one of the columns in the British Museum.\nAt the beginning of the reign of Xerxes I, the Throne Hall was used mainly for receptions for military commanders and representatives of all the subject nations of the empire. Later, the Throne Hall served as an imperial museum.\n\n\n=== The Tachara Palace ===\nTachara, was the exclusive palace of Darius the Great at Persepolis. Only a small portion of the palace was finished under his rule, it was completed after the death of Darius in 486 BC, by his son and successor, Xerxes, who called it a Taçara, which means \"winter palace\" in Old Persian. It was then used by Artaxerxes I. In the 4th century BC, following his invasion of Iran in 330 BC, Alexander the Great allowed his troops to loot Persepolis. This palace was one of the few structures that escaped destruction in the burning of the complex by Alexander's army, and because of that, Tachara is the most intact building of Persepolis today. It is also the oldest structure at Persepolis. Tachara stands back to back to the Apadana, and is oriented southward.\n\n\n=== The Hadish Palace ===\nThe Hadish Palace of Xerxes is one of palaces at Persepolis. It's located on the east of the Palace of H (Artaxerxes I). The palace occupies the highest level of terrace and stands on the living rock. The inscriptions of the palace attest that the building was built by order of Xerxes. It covers an area of 2550 square meters (40*55 meters). A double staircase on the west leads to courtyard of the Tachara chateau and another staircase on the northeast connects to courtyard of the Council Hall.\n\n\n=== Other palaces and structures ===\nThe Council Hall, the Tryplion Hall, the Palaces of D, G, H, storerooms, stables and quarters, the unfinished gateway and a few miscellaneous structures at Persepolis are located near the south-east corner of the terrace, at the foot of the mountain.\n\n\n=== Tombs ===\n\nIt is commonly accepted that Cyrus the Great was buried in the Tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadae, which is mentioned by Ctesias as his own city. If it is true that the body of Cambyses II was brought home \"to the Persians,\" his burying place must be somewhere beside that of his father. Ctesias assumes that it was the custom for a king to prepare his own tomb during his lifetime. Hence, the kings buried at Naghsh-e Rostam are probably Darius I, Xerxes I, Artaxerxes I and Darius II. Xerxes II, who reigned for a very short time, could scarcely have obtained so splendid a monument, and still less could the usurper Sogdianus. The two completed graves behind the compound at Persepolis would then belong to Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III. The unfinished tomb, a kilometer away from the city, is debated to who it belongs.\n\n\n=== Ancient Texts ===\n\nThere are a total of 11 existing inscriptions at Persepolis, related to Darius the Great, Xerxes, Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III. The relevant passages from ancient scholars on the subject are set out below:\n\nPersepolis was the capital of the Persian kingdom. Alexander described it to the Macedonians as the most hateful of the cities of Asia, and gave it over to his soldiers to plunder, all but the palaces. (2) It was the richest city under the sun, and the private houses had been furnished with every sort of wealth over the years. The Macedonians raced into it, slaughtering all the men whom they met and plundering the residences; many of the houses belonged to the common people and were abundantly supplied with furniture and wearing apparel of every kind...\n72 (1) Alexander held games in honor of his victories. He performed costly sacrifices to the gods and entertained his friends bountifully. While they were feasting and the drinking was far advanced, as they began to be drunken, a madness took possession of the minds of the intoxicated guests. (2) At this point, one of the women present, Thais by name and Attic by origin, said that for Alexander it would be the finest of all his feats in Asia if he joined them in a triumphal procession, set fire to the palaces, and permitted women's hands in a minute to extinguish the famed accomplishments of the Persians. (3) This was said to men who were still young and giddy with wine, and so, as would be expected, someone shouted out to form up and to light torches, and urged all to take vengeance for the destruction of the Greek temples. (4) Others took up the cry and said that this was a deed worthy of Alexander alone. When the king had caught fire at their words, all leaped up from their couches and passed the word along to form a victory procession [epinikion komon] in honor of Dionysius.\n\n(5) Promptly, many torches were gathered. Female musicians were present at the banquet, so the king led them all out for the komos to the sound of voices and flutes and pipes, Thais the courtesan leading the whole performance. (6) She was the first, after the king, to hurl her blazing torch into the palace. As the others all did the same, immediately the entire palace area was consumed, so great was the conflagration. It was most remarkable that the impious act of Xerxes, king of the Persians, against the acropolis at Athens should have been repaid in kind after many years by one woman, a citizen of the land which had suffered it, and in sport.\nOn the following day, the king called together the leaders of his forces and informed them that \"no city was more mischievous to the Greeks than the seat of the ancient kings of Persia [...] by its destruction they ought to offer sacrifice to the spirits of their forefathers.\"\n7 (1) But Alexander's great mental endowments, that noble disposition, in which he surpassed all kings, that intrepidity in encountering dangers, his promptness in forming and carrying out plans, his good faith towards those who submitted to him, merciful treatment of his prisoners, temperance even in lawful and usual pleasures, were sullied by an excessive love of wine. (2) At the very time when his enemy and his rival for a throne was preparing to renew the war, when those whom he had conquered were but lately subdued and were hostile to the new rule, he took part in prolonged banquets at which women were present, not indeed those whom it would be a crime to violate, but, to be sure, harlots who were accustomed to live with armed men with more licence than was fitting.\n(3) One of these, Thais by name, herself also drunken, declared that the king would win most favor among all the Greeks, if he should order the palace of the Persians to be set on fire; that this was expected by those whose cities the barbarians had destroyed. (4) When a drunken strumpet had given her opinion on a matter of such moment, one or two, themselves also loaded with wine, agreed. The king, too, more greedy for wine than able to carry it, cried: \"Why do we not, then, avenge Greece and apply torches to the city?\" (5) All had become heated with wine, and so they arose when drunk to fire the city which they had spared when armed. The king was the first to throw a firebrand upon the palace, then the guests and the servants and courtesans. The palace had been built largely of cedar, which quickly took fire and spread the conflagration widely. (6) When the army, which was encamped not far from the city, saw the fire, thinking it accidental, they rushed to bear aid. (7) But when they came to the vestibule of the palace, they saw the king himself piling on firebrands. Therefore, they left the water which they had brought, and they too began to throw dry wood upon the burning building.\n(8) Such was the end of the capital of the entire Orient... .\n\n(10) The Macedonians were ashamed that so renowned a city had been destroyed by their king in a drunken revel; therefore the act was taken as earnest, and they forced themselves to believe that it was right that it should be wiped out in exactly that manner. \nAnd did not Alexander the Great have with him Thais, the Athenian hetaira? Cleitarchus speaks of her as having been the cause for the burning of the palace at Persepolis. After Alexander's death, this same Thais was married to Ptolemy, the first king of Egypt. \n\n\n== Modern events ==\n\n\n=== 2,500-year celebration ===\nIn 1971, Persepolis was the main staging ground for the 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire under the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the second and last Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty. It included delegations from foreign nations in an attempt to advance the Iranian culture and history.\n\n\n=== The controversy of the Sivand Dam ===\nConstruction of the Sivand Dam, named after the nearby town of Sivand, began on 19 September 2006. Despite 10 years of planning, Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization was not aware of the broad areas of flooding during much of this time, and there is growing concern about the effects the dam will have on the surrounding areas of Persepolis. Activists expressed concern that the dam's placement between the ruins of Pasargadae and Persepolis will flood both. Engineers involved with the construction deny this claim, stating that it is impossible, because both sites sit well above the planned waterline. Of the two sites, Pasargadae is considered the more threatened.\n\n\n=== Nowruz Celebrations ===\nEvery year during Nowruz, a large number of people come to Persepolis to celebrate the new year. In 2024, 10,000 people were at Persepolis when Nowruz started.\n\n\n=== First concert ===\nIn a groundbreaking cultural event, Iranian vocalist Alireza Ghorbani performed the first-ever concert at Persepolis from 29 June to 1 July 2024, and received an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response from attendees.\n\n\n=== Cultural events ===\nVarious events are held in Persepolis every year, including the Shahnameh reading festival and other cultural events.\n\n\n=== Conservation issues ===\nThe site is also threatened by the presence of lichens that have grown on the surface of the monuments, some of which have eroded intricate carvings and motifs. Some of the lichens are estimated to be around 1,700 years old, and their spread has been attributed to industrialisation, acid rain and the extreme desert climate.\n\n\n== Museums (outside Iran) that display objects from Persepolis ==\nOne bas-relief from Persepolis is in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England. The largest collection of reliefs is at the British Museum, sourced from multiple British travellers who worked in Iran in the 19th century. The Persepolis bull at the Oriental Institute in Chicago is one of the university's most prized treasures, part of the division of finds from the excavations of the 1930s. New York City's Metropolitan Museum and Detroit Institute of Art houses objects from Persepolis, as does the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology of the University of Pennsylvania. The Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon and the Louvre of Paris hold objects from Persepolis as well. A bas-relief of a soldier that had been looted from the excavations in 1935–36 and later purchased by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts was repatriated to Iran in 2018, after being offered for sale in London and New York.\n\n\n== Foreign visitors graffiti at Persepolis ==\n\nSome European travelers throughout history have left graffiti on the walls of Persepolis during their visits.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

Using a non-linear story line, Karr describes the troubles of growing up in a family and town where heavy alcohol abuse and psychological problems are common issues. The memoir details her experience being raped and molested as a child, her mother's mental instability, and her witness to death and disparity.\nThe book is split into three sections, each corresponds to a different period of her life. The first section, called \"Texas, 1961\", details Karr's and her sister Lecia's upbringing in Southeast Texas. The narrative includes backgrounds on her mother Charlie and her father J.P., including how they met, and their previous relationships. Karr also writes about her maternal grandmother who, at 50 years old, died of cancer. \nThe second section of the book is called \"Colorado, 1963\". Karr explains that her family \"moved to Colorado wholly by accident\". While in Colorado, Karr's parents get divorced, and J.P. moves back to Texas, while Karr and her sister stay with Charlie. Her mother eventually meets Hector, who tries to make the girls call him \"Daddy\". After Charlie begins to drink again, Karr and Lecia become scared when one night their mother points a gun at and threatens Hector. Eventually, J.P. flies the girls back to Texas. Charlie and Hector travel to Texas too, and after J.P. punches Hector, Charlie leaves him, returning to her ex-husband for good. \nThe third section titled, \"Texas Again, 1980\", jumps ahead 17 years to a period when Karr is older and living in Boston. She returns to Texas after her father suffers a stroke. Karr helps Charlie care for J.P. While there, Karr reconnects with her mother and learns more about Charlie's mysterious past and previous mental health issues.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nThe Liars' Club received universal acclaim upon its publication in 1995. Sheila Ballantyne of The New York Times lauds the memoir's \"haunting, often exquisite phrasing of states of being and qualities of mind that resonate long after a page is turned.\" Writing for The Washington Post, Jonathan Yardley noted that, \"The Liars' Club is a tribute to and lament for a world its author no longer occupies. ... It is the essential American story.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

After publication, Jerry Weintraub optioned the book, a process that \"rents\" the rights to a source material to a potential film producer, and Saks won a 2009 MacArthur Fellows Program grant for US$500,000.\n\n\n== Author and background ==\nAt the time of publication, the author Elyn R. Saks was an endowed professor at the USC Gould School of Law and an adjunct psychiatry professor at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. Saks graduated as valedictorian from Vanderbilt University in June 1977, where she studied philosophy. After graduation, she earned a Marshall Scholarship and graduated from Oxford University in 1981 with a Master of Letters in philosophy. Saks has a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School (1986) and a Doctor of Philosophy from the New Center for Psychoanalysis.\nThe book's title originated from a line in \"The Second Coming\", a 1919 poem by W. B. Yeats. According to Rosalind Austin in the journal Mental Health and Social Inclusion, the title conveys \"the extent to which her illness fractures her reality\" and invokes \"the literary context of an apocalyptic world, where 'the falcon cannot hear the falconer, Things fall apart'.\" Hyperion Books published the first edition of The Center Cannot Hold in 2007; subsequent editions have been published by Grand Central Publishing.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe Center Cannot Hold details episodes of psychosis, hospitalizations, and Saks's evolving relationship with treatment, including antipsychotic medication and psychoanalysis. The memoir begins with a prologue which describes Saks at the Yale Law Library, where she climbs through a window onto the roof and scares her classmates with her nonsensical utterances. The next day she is taken to the Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) emergency room, where doctors restrain her to a metal bed.\nAt seven or eight, Saks experiences a loss in her sense of self in which her awareness grows unclear and she feels like \"a sand castle with all the sand sliding away in the receding surf\", though she says the experience is difficult to describe. Walking home during the day from high school, Saks believes houses are sending her messages. After high school, she attends Vanderbilt University, where she begins to neglect her hygiene. \n\nSaks recounts one experience of swallowing a full bottle of aspirin pills, making herself vomit, and being taken to Vanderbilt Hospital. She graduates from Vanderbilt and attends Oxford, where she isolates and talks and gestures to herself. At the advice of a friend's neurologist husband, she sees a general practitioner, to whom Saks shows a burn mark she intentionally inflicted and states how she would commit suicide if given the chance. She is eventually admitted to the Warneford Hospital in Oxford, where she begins taking amitriptyline for depression.\nRe-admitted at Warneford, Saks walks the tunnels underneath the hospital and burns herself. She begins Kleinian analysis with a psychoanalyst, Mrs. Jones, is discharged from Warneford, and completes her graduate degree at Oxford. Saks applies to law school and Yale accepts her, though she is no longer on any medication or in therapy by the time she reaches the campus. A professor brings Saks to the YNHH emergency room after a psychotic break, where she is put in mechanical restraints.\nReleased to the YNHH's Psychiatric Evaluation Unit, Memorial Unit 10 (MU10), after a stay at the Yale Psychiatric Institute (YPI), Saks is restrained on and off for the next three weeks. MU10 calls the law school and informs the dean she cannot return \"that year, or possibly ever\", effectively withdrawing from the school. A doctor diagnoses her with paranoid schizophrenia. She returns to YPI, but transfers to Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital on the advice of a therapist; after three months, she is discharged and returns to her family, again off her antipsychotic medications.\n\nRe-admitted to Yale, Saks re-enters psychoanalysis with psychiatrist Dr. Joseph White, who prescribes her Navane. She befriends Stephen H. Behnke, and variously goes off and comes back on medication. Saks graduates from Yale Law School and scores in the 99th percentile on her bar exam. She eventually accepts a position at USC Gould School of Law, which turns into a tenured professorship, though again she struggles to stay on her medications with her new psychiatrist, Dr. Kaplan.\nShe meets Will, a librarian at USC, and asks him to lunch; he accepts. Saks summarizes that \"[w]hile medication had kept me alive, it had been psychoanalysis that had helped me find a life worth living\". She tells Will about her schizophrenia, and he accepts her. Saks defeats breast cancer, and marries Will. She believes Stephen and Dr. Kaplan are replaced by identical imposters, an example of Capgras syndrome. Kaplan threatens to tell the Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, where she attends, that she is not in analysis anymore, although she is, which she interprets as his attempt to punish her; she retains a new psychiatrist, Dr. Freed. The book concludes that \"[m]y good fortune is not that I've recovered from mental illness. [...] My good fortune lies in having found my life\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Center Cannot Hold was reviewed positively in a number of publications, with reviewers emphasizing the importance of psychoanalysis in Saks's journey. In a review for The American Journal of Psychiatry, Justin Simon called The Center Cannot Hold a complex insider perspective of schizophrenia, with psychoanalysis a curing force for her substantial mental illness; other factors that led to her success, according to Simon, included an intact family that could afford treatment, and Saks's ability to form friendships. J. Simon noted that \"most predictable disorganizing influence is change\" in her life. Similarly, Dale L. Johnson, professor emeritus in the department of psychology at the University of Houston, wrote in Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal that Saks's relationship with Will helped her in coping with her illness. Overall, Nirbhay N. Singh of the Journal of Child and Family Studies said Saks utilized her brain to heal her brain.\nSaks's relationship with medication was also highlighted by reviewers as important. In the San Francisco Chronicle, Clea Simon stated how the importance of treatment allowed Saks to write the book, calling it a historical original and noting how treatment allowed Ken Steele to write his 2001 memoir The Day the Voices Stopped about his psychosis as well. C. Simon describes the book as fluent but at times deeply disturbing. A reviewer for Publishers Weekly agreed, detailing that the book was weighty reading and calling Saks's constant desire to cease medication a motif.\nIn The Psychoanalytic Review, psychoanalyst Susan Flynn noted \"[w]hile each analysis is complete unto itself, it lives in relation and gathers meaning from its proximity to the others\". She described the book as a \"love song to psychoanalysis\" and \"required reading for clinical training programs\". Though Johnson states \"research has shown that psychoanalysis does not help people with schizophrenia\", and due to this it \"has been virtually abandoned as a treatment modality for this group of patients\", he states psychoanalysis seems to have helped Saks. Johnson further states Saks's vivid descriptions of her psychotic ramblings reminded him of the descriptions of psychosis in Mark Vonnegut's The Eden Express.\nFrancis Anthony O'Neill of the Ulster Medical Journal described the memoir as a \"very clear and unsentimental account\" of living with schizophrenia and praised it as \"remarkable, bold and clearly written\". He noted its value as a first-hand perspective on psychosis and highlighted Saks's critique of physical restraints in psychiatric care. O'Neill emphasized that the book avoids the excesses of so-called \"misery lit\", calling it \"particularly thought provoking for those of us at the 'other side' of the experience\". Jonathan Britmann, head of the Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy in Pruszków, Poland, wrote in Psychosis that \"[t]his is a live testimony confirming what many people want to deny: it confirms that a human being suffering from schizophrenia has the same needs as all of us who consider ourselves as normal\".\nSome reviewers found the book slow-paced. An overview in Kirkus Reviews stated \"she spends more time on the history of institutionalization and treatment than she does on the emotional and psychological details that would rescue her account from tedium\", and called the book \"often a snooze\". Similarly, Flynn described the book as \"slow—at times excruciating, but always truthful\".\n\n\n== Post publication ==\nThe Center Cannot Hold won a \"Books for a Better Life\" Inspirational Memoir Award, presented by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Benedict Carey of The New York Times described the book as \"an overnight sensation in mental health circles\"; after publication, Saks went on a speaking tour and Jerry Weintraub optioned The Center Cannot Hold, a process that \"rents\" the rights to a source material to a potential film producer. Saks opened two research studies following the book's publication, and subsequently won a 2009 MacArthur Fellows Program \"genius grant\" for US$500,000.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of memoirs about schizophrenia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBerman, Jeffrey; Berman, Jeffrey (January 1, 2019), \"\"Someone Acts Through My Brain\": Elyn R.

    "full_narrative": "Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness is a 2012 New York Times best-selling autobiography by New York Post writer Susannah Cahalan. The book details Cahalan's struggle with a rare form of encephalitis and her recovery.  It was first published on November 13, 2012, through Free Press in hardback, and was later reprinted in paperback by Simon & Schuster after the two companies merged.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book narrates Cahalan's issues with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and the process by which she was diagnosed with this form of encephalitis. She woke up in a hospital with no memory of the previous month's events, during which time she had violent episodes and delusions. Her eventual diagnosis was made more difficult by various physicians misdiagnosing her with several theories such as \"partying too much\" and schizoaffective disorder. Eventually several physicians, including Dr. Souhel Najjar, began to suspect that Cahalan was suffering from an autoimmune disease. Najjar diagnosed Cahalan using a test that involved her drawing a clock, a test normally given to people suspected of having dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Rather than drawing the clock face normally, the disease caused Cahalan to draw all the numbers 1 through 12 on the right face of the clock, because the right side of her brain, which regulates the left side of the body, was inflamed. Najjar used this to help diagnose Cahalan and start her road to recovery.\nThe book also covers Cahalan's life after her recovery, including her reactions to watching videotapes of her psychotic episodes while in the hospital. Cahalan also discusses her symptoms prior to her hospitalization, as she had previously been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with bipolar disorder. While researching, she learned that the disease had been discovered just three years before she became ill. Her research indicated that in 2009, most people with the disease were either misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Cahalan was fortunate to be correctly diagnosed because, according to Najjar's estimates, only 10 percent of people with the disease were properly diagnosed at that time. Since then, a better understanding of the disease and its symptoms has resulted in more frequent diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCritical reception for Brain on Fire has been mostly positive. NPR commented that the author was \"a naturally talented prose stylist\" and that \"she perfectly tempers her brutal honesty with compassion and something like vulnerability.\" The Washington Post praised Cahalan's researching abilities for the book, as they noted that she had to rely on information from others, including family members and medical documents. The book has sold over a million copies, has been translated into more than twenty languages and has helped thousands of patients get diagnosed.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nIn May 2014, it was announced that the book was being adapted into a film of the same name, starring Chloë Grace Moretz and produced by Cahalan and Charlize Theron. The film was released on Netflix on June 22, 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

    "full_narrative": "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Hebrew: קיצור תולדות האנושות, Qitzur Toldot ha-Enoshut) is a 2011 book by Yuval Noah Harari, based on a series of lectures he taught at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It was first published in Hebrew in Israel in 2011, and in English in 2014. The book focuses on Homo sapiens, and surveys the history of humankind, starting from the Stone Age and going up to the 21st century. The account is situated within a framework that intersects the natural sciences with the social sciences.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nHarari's work places human history within a framework, with the natural sciences setting limits for human activity and social sciences shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline of history is the account of cultural change.\nHarari surveys the history of humankind from the Stone Age up to the 21st century, focusing on Homo sapiens. He divides the history of H. sapiens into four major parts:\n\nThe Cognitive Revolution (c. 70,000 BCE, the start of behavioral modernity when imagination evolved in H. sapiens).\nThe (first) Agricultural Revolution (c. 10,000 BCE, the development of agriculture).\nThe Unification of Humankind (c. 34 CE, the gradual consolidation of human political organizations towards globalization).\nThe Scientific Revolution (c. 1543 CE, the emergence of objective science).\nHarari's main argument is that H. sapiens came to dominate the world because they are the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. He argues that prehistoric H. sapiens were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the Neanderthals and numerous other megafauna. He further argues that the ability of H. sapiens to cooperate in large numbers arises from its unique capacity to believe in things existing purely in the imagination, such as gods, nations, money and human rights. He argues that these beliefs give rise to discrimination – whether racial, sexual or political – and it is potentially impossible to have a completely unbiased society. Harari claims that all large-scale human cooperation systems – including religions, political structures, trade networks and legal institutions – owe their emergence to H. sapiens' distinctive cognitive capacity for fiction. Accordingly, Harari describes money as a system of mutual trust and political and economic systems as similar to religions.\nHarari's key claim regarding the Agricultural Revolution is that while it promoted population growth for H. sapiens and co-evolving species like wheat and cows, it made the lives of most individuals (and animals) worse than they had been when H. sapiens were mostly hunter-gatherers, since their diet and daily lives became significantly less varied. Humans' violent treatment of other animals is a theme that runs throughout the book.\nIn discussing the unification of humankind, Harari argues that over its history, the trend for H. sapiens has increasingly been towards political and economic interdependence. For centuries, the majority of humans lived in empires, and capitalist globalization is effectively producing one, global empire. Harari argues that money, empires, and universal religions are the principal drivers of this process.\nHarari describes the Scientific Revolution as an innovation in European thought, whereby elites became willing to admit to and try to remedy their own ignorance. He describes this as one driver of early modern European imperialism and of the current convergence of human cultures. Harari also claims there is a lack of research into the history of happiness, positing that people today are not significantly happier than in past eras. He concludes by discussing how modern technology may soon end the species by ushering in genetic engineering, immortality, and non-organic life. Harari metaphorically describes humans as deities in that they can create species.\nHarari cites Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997) as one of the greatest inspirations for the book.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Popular reception ===\nFirst published in Hebrew in 2011, the book was later released in English in 2014 and has since been translated into 65 different languages. It made The New York Times best-seller list, appearing for 182 weeks (as of May 2022) including 96 consecutive weeks. It won the National Library of China's Wenjin Book Award for the best book published in 2014. Writing four years after its English-language publication, Alex Preston wrote in The Guardian that Sapiens had become a \"publishing phenomenon\" with \"wild success\" symptomatic of a broader trend toward \"intelligent, challenging nonfiction, often books that are several years old\". Concurrently, The Guardian listed the book as among the ten \"best brainy books of the decade\". The Royal Society of Biologists in the UK shortlisted the book in its 2015 Book Awards. Bill Gates ranked Sapiens among his ten favorite books, and Mark Zuckerberg also recommended it. Kirkus Reviews awarded a star to the book, noting that it is \"the great debates of history aired out with satisfying vigor\". The British daily The Times also gave the book a rave review, quoting that \"Sapiens is the kind of book that sweeps cobwebs out of your brain\" and that it is \"mind-thrilling\". The Sydney Morning Herald described the book as \"always engaging and often provocative\".\nIn 2015 the Israel Museum in Jerusalem created a special, temporary exhibit based on the book, using archeological and artistic displays to demonstrate the main themes found in the book. The exhibit ran from May until December 2015.\nDiscussing the book's success in 2020, Ian Parker writing for The New Yorker said \"the book thrived in an environment of relative critical neglect\" since it received few major reviews at the time of its release. Parker describes Sapiens' extremely broad scope as being a defense against expert criticism. Quoting Harari's academic advisor Steven Gunn, \"Nobody's an expert on the meaning of everything, or the history of everybody, over a long period.\" In a 2022 article titled \"The Dangerous Populist Science of Yuval Noah Harari\" for Current Affairs, neuroscientist Darshana Narayanan expanded on The New Yorker's comments: \"I tried my hand at fact-checking Sapiens ... I consulted colleagues in the neuroscience and evolutionary biology community and found that Harari's errors are numerous and substantial, and cannot be dismissed as nit-picking.\"\n\n\n=== Scholarly reception ===\nAnthropologist Christopher Robert Hallpike reviewed the book and did not find any \"serious contribution to knowledge\". Hallpike suggested that \"...whenever his facts are broadly correct they are not new, and whenever he tries to strike out on his own he often gets things wrong, sometimes seriously\". He considered it an infotainment publishing event offering a \"wild intellectual ride across the landscape of history, dotted with sensational displays of speculation, and ending with blood-curdling predictions about human destiny.\"\nScience journalist Charles C. Mann concluded in The Wall Street Journal, \"There's a whiff of dorm-room bull sessions about the author's stimulating but often unsourced assertions.\"\nReviewing the book in The Washington Post, evolutionary anthropologist Avi Tuschman points out problems stemming from the contradiction between Harari's \"freethinking scientific mind\" and his \"fuzzier worldview hobbled by political correctness\", but nonetheless wrote that \"Harari's book is important reading for serious-minded, self-reflective sapiens.\"\nReviewing the book in The Guardian, philosopher Galen Strawson concluded that, among several other problems, \"Much of Sapiens is extremely interesting, and it is often well expressed. As one reads on, however, the attractive features of the book are overwhelmed by carelessness, exaggeration and sensationalism\". He specifically mentions how the author ignores happiness studies, that his claims of the \"opening of a gap between the tenets of liberal humanism and the latest findings of the life sciences\" is silly and deplores that the author \"transforms Adam Smith into the apostle of greed\".\n\n\n== Bibliographic details ==\nThe original Hebrew publication was first issued in 2011 as קיצור תולדות האנושות [Ḳitsur toldot ha-enoshut], which translates into A Brief History of Humankind.\nA 2012 English translation was self-published with the title From Animals Into Gods. The English translation was published in 2015 as Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, \"translated by the author with the help of John Purcell and Haim Watzman\", simultaneously in London by Harvill Secker ISBN 978-1846558238 (hardback), ISBN 978-1846558245 (trade paperback) and in Canada by Signal (ISBN 978-0-7710-3850-1 (bound), ISBN 978-0-7710-3852-5 (html)).

The book was first published in Hebrew in 2015 by Dvir publishing; the English-language version was published in September 2016 in the United Kingdom and in February 2017 in the United States.\nAs with its predecessor, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Harari recounts the course of human history while describing events and the individual human experience, along with ethical issues in relation to his historical survey. However, Homo Deus (from Latin \"Homo\" meaning man or human and \"Deus\" meaning God) deals more with the abilities acquired by humans (Homo sapiens) throughout their existence, and their evolution as the dominant species in the world. The book describes mankind's current abilities and achievements and attempts to paint an image of the future. Many philosophical issues are discussed, such as humanism, individualism, transhumanism, and mortality.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book sets out to examine possibilities of the future of Homo sapiens. The premise outlines that during the 21st century, humanity is likely to make a significant attempt to gain happiness, immortality, and God-like powers. Throughout the book, Harari openly speculates various ways that this ambition might be realised in the future based on the past and present. The book focuses as well on humanism, religion and capitalism and compares the two throughout the book. \n\n\n=== Homo sapiens conquers the world ===\nThe first part of the book explores the relationship between humans and other animals, exploring what led to the former's dominance over the latter.\nHarari speculates as well why homo sapiens and not neanderthals rule the world.\n\n\n=== Homo sapiens gives meaning to the world ===\nSince the language revolution some 70,000 years ago, humans have lived within an \"intersubjective reality\", such as countries, borders, religion, money and companies, all created to enable large-scale, flexible cooperation between different individual human beings. Humanity is separated from other animals by humans' ability to believe in these intersubjective constructs that exist only in the human mind and are given force through collective belief.\nHumankind's immense ability to give meaning to its actions and thoughts is what has enabled its many achievements.\nHarari argues that humanism is a form of religion that worships humankind instead of a god. It puts humankind and its desires as a top priority in the world, in which humans themselves are framed as the dominant beings. Humanists believe that ethics and values are derived internally within each individual, rather than from an external source. During the 21st century, Harari believes that humanism may push humans to search for immortality, happiness, and power.\nThe book explores three different kinds of humanism including socialist humanism, evolutionary humanism and liberal humanism. Harari discusses their advantages as well as their impact on society throughout history and explores their chore doctrines and ideology. Harari speculates about various theories why different kinds of humanism have conquered the world throughout the last centuries and compares them in various aspects to religion.\nHararis concludes that humanism is \"the leading world religion\" because humanism is flexible and adapts itself to new inventions and changes in society. The book states that religion has lost influence throughout previous centuries because religion tries to solve problems and answer questions by looking for the answer in holy scripts, whereas humanism in comparison would solve problems through science, research and innovation.\n\n\n=== Homo sapiens loses control ===\nTechnological developments have threatened the continued ability of humans to give meaning to their lives; Harari suggests the possibility of the replacement of humankind with the super-man, or \"homo deus\" (human god) endowed with abilities such as eternal life.\nThe last chapter suggests the possibility that humans are algorithms, and as such Homo sapiens may not be dominant in a universe where big data becomes a paradigm. As humans absorb more data, they become more algorithmic and more efficient at processing data, which gives humans deeper emotions and superior intellectual abilities. However, the rapidly growing data may ultimately consume humans in the sense that nothing that originally made us human is left, and make humans obsolete.\nThe book closes with the following question addressed to the reader:\"What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?\"\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nTime magazine listed Homo Deus as one of its top ten non-fiction books of 2017.\nWellcome longlisted Homo Deus for their 2017 Book Prize.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Popular reception ===\nHomo Deus was reviewed or discussed in The New York Times, The Guardian, The Economist, The New Yorker, NPR, Financial Times, and Times Higher Education.\nSteve Aoki's song \"Homo Deus\" on the album Neon Future IV is named after the book and features Harari's narration of the audiobook.\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nWriting in The Guardian, David Runciman praised the book's originality and style, although he suggested that it lacked empathy for Homo sapiens. The review points out that \"Harari cares about the fate of animals in a human world but he writes about the prospects for Homo sapiens in a data-driven world with a lofty insouciance.\" He also added: \"Harari would probably be the first to admit, it's [the book] only intelligent by human standards, which are nothing special. By the standards of the smartest machines it’s woolly and speculative.\" Runciman nonetheless gave the book a generally positive review.\nIn a mixed review, The Economist called Homo Deus \"a glib work, full of corner-cutting sleights of hand and unsatisfactory generalisations\" and stated that \"Mr Harari has a tendency towards scientific name-dropping—words like biotech, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence abound—but he rarely engages with these topics in any serious way.\"\nWriting in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, Allan McCay has challenged Harari's claims about human algorithmic agency.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nThe following translations have become available:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\n21 Lessons for the 21st Century\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPublic conversation on the book with BBC producer at London's Emmanuel Centre on 5 September 2016 – 1 hour 31 minutes, including Q&A.

It is dedicated to the author's husband, Itzik.\nThe book consists of five parts, each containing four or five essays. The book focuses on present-day issues and societal questions.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nThe book had articles and reviews published by The New York Times, The Economist, Financial Times, The Guardian, New Statesman, and The Times.\nIn The New York Times, Bill Gates calls the book \"fascinating\" and his author \"such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking.\" For Gates, Harari \"has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the 21st century.\"\nJohn Thornhill in Financial Times said that \"[although] 21 Lessons is lit up by flashes of intellectual adventure and literary verve, it is probably the least illuminating of the three books\" written by Harari, and that many of the observations in it feel recycled from the two others. Helen Lewis review in The Guardian is not as glowing but admires \"the ambition and breadth of his work, smashing together unexpected ideas into dazzling observations.\"\nThe book has also received negative reviews. Gavin Jacobson in the New Statesman sees it as \"a study thick with promise and thin in import\" with advice \"either too vague or too hollow to provide any meaningful guidance.\" In The Times, Gerard DeGroot writes: \"The author of Sapiens is good at identifying the crises to come but his syrupy platitudes are no answer.\"\n\n\n== Russian translation ==\nA Russian translation of Harari's book was published in June 2019. However, the Russian media noticed that several passages about Russia and its President Putin were excluded from the translation. In particular, the chapter about post-truth begins in the Russian edition by referring to Donald Trump's speeches instead of Putin's false statements during the Russian annexation of Crimea. The representatives of Harari admitted that this change was authorized.\nLeonid Bershidsky in Moscow Times called it \"caution — or, to call it by its proper name, cowardice\", and Nettanel Slyomovics in Haaretz claimed that Harari \"is sacrificing those same liberal ideas that he presumes to represent\". In a response, Harari stated that he \"was warned that due to these few examples Russian censorship will not allow distribution of a Russian translation of the book\" and that he \"therefore faced a dilemma\", namely to \"replace these few examples with other examples, and publish the book in Russia,\" or \"change nothing, and publish nothing\", and that he \"preferred publishing, because Russia is a leading global power and it seemed important that the book's ideas should reach readers in Russia, especially as the book is still very critical of the Putin regime – just without naming names.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\nHomo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\n\n\n== References ==",

A documentary based on the book, and produced by the National Geographic Society, was broadcast on PBS in July 2005.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe prologue opens with an account of Diamond's conversation with Yali, a Papua New Guinean politician. The conversation turned to the differences in power and technology between Papua New Guineans and the Europeans who dominated the region for two centuries, differences that neither of them considered due to European genetic superiority. Yali asked, using the local term cargo for inventions and manufactured goods, \"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\"\nDiamond realized the same question seemed to apply elsewhere: \"People of Eurasian origin ... dominate ... the world in wealth and power.\" Other peoples, after having thrown off colonial domination, still lag in wealth and power. Still others, he says, \"have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists.\"\nThe peoples of other continents (sub-Saharan Africans, Indigenous people of the Americas, Aboriginal Australians, New Guineans, and the original inhabitants of tropical Southeast Asia) have been largely conquered, displaced and in some extreme cases – referring to Native Americans, Aboriginal Australians, and South Africa's indigenous Khoisan peoples – largely exterminated by farm-based societies such as Eurasians and Bantu. He believes this is due to these societies' technological and immunological advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after the last ice age.\n\n\n=== Title ===\nThe book's title is a reference to the means by which farm-based societies conquered populations and maintained dominance though sometimes being vastly outnumbered, so that imperialism was enabled by guns, germs, and steel.\nDiamond argues geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics which favored early development of stable agricultural societies ultimately led to immunity to diseases endemic in agricultural animals and the development of powerful, organized states capable of dominating others.\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nDiamond argues that Eurasian civilization is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. That is, civilization is not created out of superior intelligence, but is the result of a chain of developments, each made possible by certain preconditions.\nThe first step towards civilization is the move from nomadic hunter-gatherer to rooted agrarian society. Several conditions are necessary for this transition to occur: access to high-carbohydrate vegetation that endures storage; a climate dry enough to allow storage; and access to animals docile enough for domestication and versatile enough to survive captivity. Control of crops and livestock leads to food surpluses. Surpluses free people to specialize in activities other than sustenance and support population growth. The combination of specialization and population growth leads to the accumulation of social and technological innovations which build on each other. Large societies develop ruling classes and supporting bureaucracies, which in turn lead to the organization of nation-states and empires.\nAlthough agriculture arose in several parts of the world, Eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication. In particular, Eurasia has barley, two varieties of wheat, and three protein-rich pulses for food; flax for textiles; and goats, sheep, and cattle. Eurasian grains were richer in protein, easier to sow, and easier to store than American maize or tropical bananas.\nAs early Western Asian civilizations developed trading relationships, they found additional useful animals in adjacent territories, such as horses and donkeys for use in transport. Diamond identifies 13 species of large animals over 100 pounds (45 kg) domesticated in Eurasia, compared with just one in South America (counting the llama and alpaca as breeds within the same species) and none at all in the rest of the world. Australia and North America suffered from a lack of useful animals due to extinction, probably by human hunting, shortly after the end of the Pleistocene, and the only domesticated animals in New Guinea came from the East Asian mainland during the Austronesian settlement around 4,000–5,000 years ago. Biological relatives of the horse, including zebras and onagers, proved untameable; and although African elephants can be tamed, it is very difficult to breed them in captivity. Diamond describes the small number of domesticated species (14 out of 148 \"candidates\") as an instance of the Anna Karenina principle: many promising species have just one of several significant difficulties that prevent domestication. He argues that all large mammals that could be domesticated, have been.\nEurasians domesticated goats and sheep for hides, clothing, and cheese; cows for milk; bullocks for tillage of fields and transport; and benign animals such as pigs and chickens. Large domestic animals such as horses and camels offered the considerable military and economic advantages of mobile transport.\n\nEurasia's large landmass and long east–west distance increased these advantages. Its large area provided more plant and animal species suitable for domestication. Equally important, its east–west orientation has allowed groups of people to wander and empires to conquer from one end of the continent to the other while staying at the same latitude. This was important because similar climate and cycle of seasons let them keep the same \"food production system\" – they could keep growing the same crops and raising the same animals all the way from Scotland to Siberia. Doing this throughout history, they spread innovations, languages and diseases everywhere.\nBy contrast, the north–south orientation of the Americas and Africa created countless difficulties adapting crops domesticated at one latitude for use at other latitudes (and, in North America, adapting crops from one side of the Rocky Mountains to the other). Similarly, Africa was fragmented by its extreme variations in climate from north to south: crops and animals that flourished in one area never reached other areas where they could have flourished, because they could not survive the intervening environment. Europe was the ultimate beneficiary of Eurasia's east–west orientation: in the first millennium BCE, the Mediterranean areas of Europe adopted Southwestern Asia's animals, plants, and agricultural techniques; in the first millennium CE, the rest of Europe followed suit.\nThe plentiful supply of food and the dense populations that it supported made division of labor possible. The rise of non-farming specialists such as craftsmen and scribes accelerated economic growth and technological progress. These economic and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer the peoples of the other continents in recent centuries by using guns and steel, particularly after the devastation of native populations by the epidemic diseases from germs.\nEurasia's dense populations, high levels of trade, and living in close proximity to livestock resulted in widespread transmission of diseases, including from animals to humans. Smallpox, measles, and influenza were the result of close proximity between dense populations of animals and humans. Natural selection endowed most Eurasians with genetic variations making them less susceptible to some diseases, and constant circulation of diseases meant adult individuals had developed immunity to a wide range of pathogens. When Europeans made contact with the Americas, European diseases (to which Americans had no immunity) ravaged the indigenous American population, rather than the other way around. The \"trade\" in diseases was a little more balanced in Africa and southern Asia, where endemic malaria and yellow fever made these regions notorious as the \"white man's grave\". Some researchers say syphilis was known to Hippocrates, and others think it was brought from the Americas by Columbus and his successors. The European diseases from germs obliterated indigenous populations so that relatively small numbers of Europeans could maintain dominance.\nDiamond proposes geographical explanations for why western European societies, rather than other Eurasian powers such as China, have been the dominant colonizers. He said Europe's geography favored balkanization into smaller, closer nation-states, bordered by natural barriers of mountains, rivers, and coastline. Advanced civilization developed first in areas whose geography lacked these barriers, such as China, India and Mesopotamia. There, the ease of conquest meant they were dominated by large empires in which manufacturing, trade and knowledge flourished for millennia, while balkanized Europe remained more primitive.\nHowever, at a later stage of development, western Europe's fragmented governmental structure actually became an advantage. Monolithic, isolated empires without serious competition could continue mistaken policies – such as China squandering its naval mastery by banning the building of ocean-going ships – for long periods without immediate consequences. In Western Europe, by contrast, competition from immediate neighbors meant that governments could not afford to suppress economic and technological progress for long; if they did not correct their mistakes, they were out-competed and/or conquered relatively quickly. While the leading powers alternated, a constant was rapid development of knowledge which could not be suppressed. For instance, the Chinese Emperor could ban shipbuilding and be obeyed, ending China's Age of Discovery, but the Pope could not keep Galileo's Dialogue from being republished in Protestant countries, or Kepler and Newton from continuing his progress; this ultimately enabled European merchant ships and navies to navigate around the globe. Western Europe also benefited from a more temperate climate than Southwestern Asia where intense agriculture ultimately damaged the environment, encouraged desertification, and hurt soil fertility.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nGuns, Germs, and Steel argues that cities require an ample supply of food, and thus are dependent on agriculture. As farmers do the work of providing food, division of labor allows others freedom to pursue other functions, such as mining and literacy.\nThe crucial trap for the development of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the Fertile Crescent since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, teosinte.\nAlso important to the transition from hunter-gatherer to city-dwelling agrarian societies was the presence of \"large\" domesticable animals, raised for meat, work, and long-distance communication. Diamond identifies a mere 14 domesticated large mammal species worldwide. The five most useful (cow, horse, sheep, goat, and pig) are all descendants of species endemic to Eurasia. Of the remaining nine, only two (the llama and alpaca both of South America) are indigenous to a land outside the temperate region of Eurasia.\nDue to the Anna Karenina principle, surprisingly few animals are suitable for domestication. Diamond identifies six criteria including the animal being sufficiently docile, gregarious, willing to breed in captivity and having a social dominance hierarchy. Therefore, none of the many African mammals such as the zebra, antelope, cape buffalo, and African elephant were ever domesticated (although some can be tamed, they are not easily bred in captivity). The Holocene extinction event eliminated many of the megafauna that, had they survived, might have become candidate species, and Diamond argues that the pattern of extinction is more severe on continents where animals that had no prior experience of humans were exposed to humans who already possessed advanced hunting techniques (such as the Americas and Australia).\nSmaller domesticable animals such as dogs, cats, chickens, and guinea pigs may be valuable in various ways to an agricultural society, but will not be adequate in themselves to sustain a large-scale agrarian society. An important example is the use of larger animals such as cattle and horses in plowing land, allowing for much greater crop productivity and the ability to farm a much wider variety of land and soil types than would be possible solely by human muscle power. Large domestic animals also have an important role in the transportation of goods and people over long distances, giving the societies that possess them considerable military and economic advantages.\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nDiamond argues that geography shaped human migration, not simply by making travel difficult (particularly by latitude), but by how climates affect where domesticable animals can easily travel and where crops can ideally grow easily due to the sun. The dominant Out of Africa theory holds that modern humans developed east of the Great Rift Valley of the African continent at one time or another. The Sahara kept people from migrating north to the Fertile Crescent, until later when the Nile River valley became accommodating. Diamond continues to describe the story of human development up to the modern era, through the rapid development of technology, and its dire consequences on hunter-gathering cultures around the world.\nDiamond touches on why the dominant powers of the last 500 years have been West European rather than East Asian, especially Chinese. The Asian areas in which big civilizations arose had geographical features conducive to the formation of large, stable, isolated empires which faced no external pressure to change which led to stagnation. Europe's many natural barriers allowed the development of competing nation states. Such competition forced the European nations to encourage innovation and avoid technological stagnation.\n\n\n=== Germs ===\nIn the later context of the European colonization of the Americas, 95% of the indigenous populations are believed to have been killed off by diseases brought by the Europeans. Many were killed by infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. Similar circumstances were observed in Australia and South Africa. Aboriginal Australians and the Khoikhoi population were devastated by smallpox, measles, influenza, and other diseases.\nDiamond questions how diseases native to the American continents did not kill off Europeans, and posits that most of these diseases were developed and sustained only in large dense populations in villages and cities. He also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through natural selection (such as the Black Death and other epidemics) during a longer time than was the case for Native American hunter-gatherers and farmers.\nHe mentions the tropical diseases (mainly malaria) that limited European penetration into Africa as an exception. Endemic infectious diseases were also barriers to European colonisation of Southeast Asia and New Guinea.\n\n\n=== Success and failure ===\nGuns, Germs, and Steel focuses on why some populations succeeded. Diamond's later book, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, focuses on environmental and other factors that have caused some populations to fail.\n\n\n== Intellectual background ==\nIn the 1930s, the Annales School in France undertook the study of long-term historical structures by using a synthesis of geography, history, and sociology. Scholars examined the impact of geography, climate, and land use. Although geography had been nearly eliminated as an academic discipline in the United States after the 1960s, several geography-based historical theories were published in the 1990s.\nIn 1991, Jared Diamond already considered the question of \"why is it that the Eurasians came to dominate other cultures?\" in The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal (part four).\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Praise ===\nMany noted that the large scope of the work makes some oversimplification inevitable while still praising the book as a very erudite and generally effective synthesis of multiple different subjects. Paul R. Ehrlich and E. O. Wilson both praised the book.\nNorthwestern University economic historian Joel Mokyr interpreted Diamond as a geographical determinist but added that the thinker could never be described as \"crude\" like many determinists. For Mokyr, Diamond's view that Eurasia succeeded largely because of a uniquely large stock of domesticable plants is flawed because of the possibility of crop manipulation and selection in the plants of other regions: the drawbacks of an indigenous North American plant such as sumpweed could have been bred out, Mokyr wrote, since \"all domesticated plants had originally undesirable characteristics\" eliminated via \"deliberate and lucky selection mechanisms\". Mokyr dismissed as unpersuasive Diamond's theory that breeding specimens failing to fix characteristics controlled by multiple genes \"lay at the heart of the geographically challenged societies\". Mokyr also states that in seeing economic history as centered on successful manipulation of environments, Diamond downplays the role of \"the option to move to a more generous and flexible area\", and speculated that non-generous environments were the source of much human ingenuity and technology. However, Mokyr still argued that Guns, Germs, and Steel is \"one of the more important contributions to long-term economic history and is simply mandatory to anyone who purports to engage Big Questions in the area of long-term global history\". He lauded the book as full of \"clever arguments about writing, language, path dependence and so on. It is brimming with wisdom and knowledge, and it is the kind of knowledge economic historians have always loved and admired.\"\nBerkeley economic historian Brad DeLong described the book as a \"work of complete and total genius\". Harvard International Relations (IR) scholar Stephen Walt in a Foreign Policy article called the book \"an exhilarating read\" and put it on a list of the ten books every IR student should read. Tufts University IR scholar Daniel W. Drezner listed the book on his top ten list of must-read books about international economic history.\nInternational Relations scholars Iver B. Neumann (of the London School of Economics and Political Science) and Einar Wigen (of University of Oslo) use Guns, Germs, and Steel as a foil for their own inter-disciplinary work. They write that \"while empirical details should, of course, be correct, the primary yardstick for this kind of work cannot be attention to detail.\" According to the two writers, \"Diamond stated clearly that any problematique of this magnitude had to be radically multi-causal and then set to work on one complex of factors, namely ecological ones\", and note that Diamond \"immediately came in for heavy criticism from specialists working in the disparate fields on which he drew\". But Neumann and Wigen also stated, \"Until somebody can come up with a better way of interpreting and adding to Diamond's material with a view to understanding the same overarching problematique, his is the best treatment available of the ecological preconditions for why one part of the world, and not another, came to dominate.\" Historian Tonio Andrade writes that Diamond's book \"may not satisfy professional historians on all counts\" but that it \"does make a bold and compelling case for the different developments that occurred in the Old World versus the New (he is less convincing in his attempts to separate Africa from Eurasia).\"\nHistorian Tom Tomlinson wrote that the magnitude of the task makes it inevitable that Professor Diamond would \"[use] very broad brush-strokes to fill in his argument\", but ultimately commended the book. Taking the account of prehistory \"on trust\" because it was not his area of expertise, Tomlinson stated that the existence of stronger weapons, diseases, and means of transport is convincing as an \"immediate cause\" of Old World societies and technologies being dominant, but questioned Diamond's view that the way this has transpired has been through certain environments causing greater inventiveness which then caused more sophisticated technology. Tomlinson noted that technology spreads and allows for military conquests and the spread of economic changes, but that in Diamond's book this aspect of human history \"is dismissed as largely a question of historical accident\". Writing that Diamond gives meager coverage to the history of political thought, the historian suggested that capitalism (which Diamond classes as one of 10 plausible but incomplete explanations) has perhaps played a bigger role in prosperity than Diamond argues.\nTomlinson speculated that Diamond underemphasizes cultural idiosyncrasies as an explanation, and argues (with regards to the \"germs\" part of Diamond's triad of reasons) that the Black Death of the 14th century, as well as smallpox and cholera in 19th century Africa, rival the Eurasian devastation of indigenous populations as overall \"events of human diffusion and coalescence\". Tomlinson also found contentious Diamond's view that humanity's future can one day be foreseen with scientific rigor since this would involve a search for general laws that new theoretical approaches deny the possibility of establishing: \"The history of humans cannot properly be equated with the history of dinosaurs, glaciers or nebulas, because these natural phenomena do not consciously create the evidence on which we try to understand them\". Tomlinson still described these flaws as \"minor\", however, and wrote that Guns, Germs, and Steel \"remains a very impressive achievement of imagination and exposition\".\nAnother historian, professor J. R. McNeill, complimented the book for \"its improbable success in making students of international relations believe that prehistory is worth their attention\", but likewise thought Diamond oversold geography as an explanation for history and under-emphasized cultural autonomy. McNeill wrote that the book's success \"is well-deserved for the first nineteen chapters–excepting a few passages–but that the twentieth chapter carries the argument beyond the breaking point, and excepting a few paragraphs, is not an intellectual success.\" But McNeill concluded, \"While I have sung its praises only in passing and dwelt on its faults, [...] overall I admire the book for its scope, for its clarity, for its erudition across several disciplines, for the stimulus it provides, for its improbable success in making students of international relations believe that prehistory is worth their attention, and, not least, for its compelling illustration that human history is embedded in the larger web of life on earth.\" Tonio Andrade described McNeill's review as \"perhaps the fairest and most succinct summary of professional world historians' perspectives on Guns, Germs, and Steel\".\nIn 2010, Tim Radford of The Guardian called the book \"exhilarating\" and lauded the passages about plants and animals as \"beautifully constructed\".\nA 2023 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics assessed Diamond's claims about topography influencing Chinese unification and contributing to European fragmentation. The study's model found that topography was a sufficient condition for the varied outcomes in Asia and Europe, but that it was not a necessary condition.\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe anthropologist Jason Antrosio described Guns, Germs, and Steel as a form of \"academic porn\", writing, \"Diamond's account makes all the factors of European domination a product of a distant and accidental history\" and \"has almost no role for human agency—the ability people have to make decisions and influence outcomes. Europeans become inadvertent, accidental conquerors. Natives succumb passively to their fate.\" He added, \"Jared Diamond has done a huge disservice to the telling of human history. He has tremendously distorted the role of domestication and agriculture in that history. Unfortunately his story-telling abilities are so compelling that he has seduced a generation of college-educated readers.\"\nIn his last book, published in 2000, the anthropologist and geographer James Morris Blaut criticized Guns, Germs, and Steel, among other reasons, for reviving the theory of environmental determinism, and described Diamond as an example of a modern Eurocentric historian. Blaut criticizes Diamond's loose use of the terms \"Eurasia\" and \"innovative\", which he believes misleads the reader into presuming that Western Europe is responsible for technological inventions that arose in the Middle East and Asia.\nAnthropologist Kerim Friedman wrote, \"While it is interesting and important to ask why technologies developed in some countries as opposed to others, I think it overlooks a fundamental issue: the inequality within countries as well as between them.\" Timothy Burke, an instructor in African history at Swarthmore College wrote: \"Anthropologists and historians interested in non-Western societies and Western colonialism also get a bit uneasy with a big-picture explanation of world history that seems to cancel out or radically de-emphasize the importance of the many small differences and choices after 1500 whose effects many of us study carefully.\"\nEconomists Daron Acemoğlu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson have written extensively about the effect of political institutions on the economic well-being of former European colonies. Their writing finds evidence that, when controlling for the effect of institutions, the income disparity between nations located at various distances from the equator disappears through the use of a two-stage least squares regression quasi-experiment using settler mortality as an instrumental variable. Their 2001 academic paper explicitly mentions and challenges the work of Diamond, and this critique is brought up again in Acemoğlu and Robinson's 2012 book Why Nations Fail.\nThe book Questioning Collapse (Cambridge University Press, 2010) is a collection of essays by fifteen archaeologists, cultural anthropologists, and historians criticizing various aspects of Diamond's books Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed and Guns, Germs and Steel. The book was a result of 2006 meeting of the American Anthropological Association in response to the misinformation they felt Diamond's popular science publications were causing and the association decided to combine experts from multiple fields of research to cover the claims made in Diamond's and debunk them. The book includes research from indigenous peoples of the societies Diamond discussed as collapsed and also vignettes of living examples of those communities, in order to showcase the main theme of the book on how societies are resilient and change into new forms over time, rather than collapsing.\n\n\n=== Awards and honors ===\nGuns, Germs, and Steel won the 1997 Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science. In 1998, it won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, in recognition of its powerful synthesis of many disciplines, and the Royal Society's Rhône-Poulenc Prize for Science Books.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nGuns, Germs, and Steel was first published by W. W. Norton in March 1997. It was published in Great Britain with the title Guns, Germs, and Steel: A Short History of Everybody for the Last 13,000 Years by Vintage in 1998. It was a selection of Book of the Month Club, History Book Club, Quality Paperback Book Club, and Newbridge Book Club.\nIn 2003 and 2007, updated English-language editions were released without changing any conclusions.\nThe National Geographic Society produced a documentary, starring Jared Diamond, based on the book and of the same title, that was broadcast on PBS in July 2005.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBantu expansion\nJames Burke (science historian)\nAlfred W.

    "full_narrative": "Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed (titled Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive for the British edition) is a 2005 book by academic and popular science author Jared Diamond, in which the author first defines collapse:  \"a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a considerable area, for an extended time.\"  He then reviews the causes of historical and pre-historical instances of societal collapse—particularly those involving significant influences from environmental changes, the effects of climate change, hostile neighbors, trade partners, and the society's response to the foregoing four challenges. It also considers why societies might not perceive a problem, might not decide to attempt a solution, and why an attempted solution might fail.\nWhile the bulk of the book is concerned with the demise of these historical civilizations, Diamond also argues that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nIn the prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes his methodology in one paragraph:\n\nThis book employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which environmental problems contribute. My previous book (Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies), had applied the comparative method to the opposite problem: the differing rates of buildup of human societies on different continents over the last 13,000 years. In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other \"input\" variables postulated to influence a society's stability. The \"output\" variables that I examine are collapse or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur. By relating output variables to input variables, I aim to tease out the influence of possible input variables on collapses.\n\n\n=== Collapses of past societies ===\nDiamond identifies five factors that contribute to collapse: climate change, hostile neighbours, collapse of essential trading partners, environmental problems, and the society's response to the foregoing four factors.\nThe root problem in all but one of Diamond's factors leading to collapse is overpopulation relative to the practicable (as opposed to the ideal theoretical) carrying capacity of the environment. One environmental problem not related to overpopulation is the harmful effect of accidental or intentional introduction of non-native species to a region.\nDiamond also writes about cultural factors (values), such as the apparent reluctance of the Greenland Norse to eat fish. Diamond also states that \"it would be absurd to claim that environmental damage must be a major factor in all collapses: the collapse of the Soviet Union is a modern counter-example, and the destruction of Carthage by Rome in 146 BC is an ancient one. It's obviously true that military or economic factors alone may suffice\".\n\n\n=== Modern societies ===\n\nHe also lists twelve environmental problems facing humankind today. The first eight have historically contributed to the collapse of past societies:\n\nDeforestation and habitat destruction\nSoil problems (erosion, salinization, and soil fertility losses)\nWater management problems\nOverhunting\nOverfishing\nEffects of introduced species on native species\nOverpopulation\nIncreased per-capita impact of people\nFurther, he says four new factors may contribute to the weakening and collapse of present and future societies:\n\n Anthropogenic climate change\n Buildup of toxins in the environment\n Energy shortages\n Full human use of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity\n\n\n=== Conclusions ===\nIn the last chapter, he discusses environmental problems facing modern societies and addresses objections that are often given to dismiss the importance of environmental problems (section \"One-liner objections\"). In the \"Further readings\" section, he gives suggestions to people who ask \"What can I do as an individual?\". He also draws conclusions, such as:\n\nIn fact, one of the main lesson to be learned from the collapses of the Maya, Anasazi, Easter Islanders, and those other past societies ... is that a society's steep decline may begin only a decade or two after the society reaches its peak numbers, wealth, and power. ... The reason is simple: maximum population, wealth, resource consumption, and waste production mean maximum environmental impact, approaching the limit where impact outstrips resources.\nFinally, he answers the question, \"What are the choices that we must make if we are to succeed, and not to fail?\" by identifying two crucial choices distinguishing the past societies that failed from those that survived:\n\nLong-term planning: \"... the courage to practice long-term thinking, and to make bold, courageous, anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they have reached crisis proportions.\" Diamond says it can be especially bad when the short-term interest of elite leaders conflicts with the long-term interests of the society, and the elite are insulated from the direct consequences.\nWillingness to reconsider core values: \"... the courage to make painful decisions about values. Which of the values that formerly served a society well can continue to be maintained under new changed circumstances? Which of these treasured values must instead be jettisoned and replaced with different approaches?\"\n\n\n== Book structure ==\n\nCollapse is divided into four parts.\nPart One describes the environment of the US state of Montana, focusing on the lives of several individuals to put a human face on the interplay between society and the environment.\nPart Two describes past societies that have collapsed. Diamond uses a \"framework\" when considering the collapse of a society, consisting of five \"sets of factors\" that may affect what happens to a society: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of trading partners, and the society's  responses to its environmental problems. A recurrent problem in collapsing societies is a structure that creates \"a conflict between the short-term interests of those in power, and the long-term interests of the society as a whole.\"\nThe societies Diamond describes are:\n\nThe Greenland Norse (cf. Hvalsey Church) (climate change, environmental damage, loss of trading partners,  hostile neighbors, irrational reluctance to eat fish, chiefs looking after their short-term interests).\nEaster Island (a society that, Diamond contends, collapsed entirely due to environmental damage)\nThe Polynesians of Pitcairn Island (environmental damage and loss of trading partners)\nThe Anasazi of southwestern North America (environmental damage and climate change)\nThe Maya of Central America (environmental damage, climate change, and hostile neighbors)\nFinally, Diamond discusses three past success stories:\nThe tiny egalitarian Pacific island of Tikopia\nThe agricultural success of egalitarian central New Guinea\nThe forest management in stratified Japan of the Tokugawa-era, and in Germany.\nPart Three examines modern societies, including:\n\nThe collapse into genocide of Rwanda, caused in part by overpopulation\nThe failure of Haiti compared with the relative success of its neighbor on Hispaniola, the Dominican Republic\nThe problems facing a developing nation, China\nThe problems facing a First World nation, Australia\nPart Four concludes the study by considering such subjects as business and globalization, and \"extracts practical lessons for us today\" (pp. 22–23). Specific attention is given to the polder model as a way Dutch society has addressed its challenges and the \"top-down\" and most importantly \"bottom-up\" approaches that we must take now that \"our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course\" (p. 498) in order to avoid the \"12 problems of non-sustainability\" that he expounds throughout the book, and reviews in the final chapter. The results of this survey are perhaps why Diamond sees \"signs of hope\" nevertheless and arrives at a position of \"cautious optimism\" for all our futures.\nThe second edition contains an Afterword: Angkor's Rise and Fall.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nTim Flannery gave Collapse the highest praise in Science, writing:\n\nWhile he planned the book, Diamond at first thought that it would deal only with human impacts on the environment. Instead, what has emerged is arguably the most incisive study of senescing human civilizations ever written. ... the fact that one of the world's most original thinkers has chosen to pen this mammoth work when his career is at his apogee is itself a persuasive argument that Collapse must be taken seriously. It is probably the most important book you will ever read.\nThe Economist's review was generally favorable, although the reviewer had two disagreements. First, the reviewer felt Diamond was not optimistic enough about the future. Secondly, the reviewer claimed Collapse contains some erroneous statistics: for instance, Diamond purportedly overstated the number of starving people in the world. University of British Columbia professor of ecological planning William Rees wrote that Collapse's most important lesson is that societies most able to avoid collapse are the ones that are most agile, able to adopt practices favorable to their own survival and avoid unfavorable ones. Moreover, Rees wrote that Collapse is \"a necessary antidote\" to followers of Julian Simon, such as Bjørn Lomborg who authored The Skeptical Environmentalist. Rees explained this assertion as follows:\n\nHuman behaviour towards the ecosphere has become dysfunctional and now arguably threatens our own long-term security. The real problem is that the modern world remains in the sway of a dangerously illusory cultural myth. Like Lomborg, most governments and international agencies seem to believe that the human enterprise is somehow 'decoupling' from the environment, and so is poised for unlimited expansion. Jared Diamond's new book, Collapse, confronts this contradiction head-on.\nJennifer Marohasy of the coal-mining backed think-tank Institute of Public Affairs wrote a critical review in Energy & Environment, in particular its chapter on Australia's environmental degradation. Marohasy claims that Diamond reflects a popular view that is reinforced by environmental campaigning in Australia, but is not supported by evidence, and argues that many of his claims are easily disproved.\nIn his review in The New Yorker, Malcolm Gladwell highlights the way Diamond's approach differs from traditional historians by focusing on environmental issues rather than cultural questions.\n\nDiamond's distinction between social and biological survival is a critical one, because too often we blur the two, or assume that biological survival is contingent on the strength of our civilizational values... The fact is, though, that we can be law-abiding and peace-loving and tolerant and inventive and committed to freedom and true to our own values and still behave in ways that are biologically suicidal.\nWhile Diamond does not reject the approach of traditional historians, his book, according to Gladwell, vividly illustrates the limitations of that approach. Gladwell demonstrates this with his own example of a recent ballot initiative in Oregon, where questions of property rights and other freedoms were subject to a free and healthy debate, but serious ecological questions were given scant attention.\nIn 2006 the book was shortlisted for The Aventis Prizes for Science Books award, eventually losing out to David Bodanis's Electric Universe.\n\n\n=== Criticisms ===\nJared Diamond's thesis that Easter Island society collapsed in isolation entirely due to environmental damage and cultural inflexibility is contested by some ethnographers and archaeologists, who argue that the introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and slave raiding, which devastated the population in the 19th century, had a much greater social impact than environmental decline, and that introduced animals—first rats and then sheep—were greatly responsible for the island's loss of native flora, which came closest to deforestation as late as 1930–1960. Diamond's account of the Easter Island collapse is strongly refuted in a chapter of the book Humankind: A Hopeful History (2019) by Dutch historian Rutger Bregman.\nThe book Questioning Collapse (Cambridge University Press, 2010) is a collection of essays by fifteen archaeologists, cultural anthropologists, and historians criticizing various aspects of Diamond's books Collapse and Guns, Germs and Steel. The book was a result of 2006 meeting of the American Anthropological Association in response to the misinformation that Diamond's popular science publications were causing and the association decided to combine experts from multiple fields of research to cover the claims made in Diamond's and debunk them. The book includes research from indigenous peoples of the societies Diamond discussed as collapsed and also vignettes of living examples of those communities, in order to showcase the main theme of the book on how societies are resilient and change into new forms over time, rather than collapsing.\n\n\n== Film ==\nIn 2010, National Geographic released the documentary film Collapse based on Diamond's book.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of environmental books\nList of important publications in anthropology\nCreeping normality\nDecline of the Roman Empire\nDeforestation during the Roman period\nEcocide\nEnvironmental disaster\nGlobal catastrophic risk\nGlobal warming\nGoliath's Curse\nHuman impact on the environment\nSocietal collapse\nSustainability\nTwilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy\nWicked problem\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nChapter 1 of Collapse\n\"Why do societies collapse?\" (2003), a TED talk by Jared Diamond\n\"Metacritic – collection of reviews of book\".

    "full_narrative": "The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration (2010) is a historical study of the Great Migration by Isabel Wilkerson and winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award. The book was widely acclaimed by critics.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe Warmth of Other Suns tells the story of the Great Migration, the movement of Black Americans out of the Southern United States to the Midwest, Northeast, and West from approximately 1915 to 1970. Throughout the twentieth century, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering cities, America and the American people.\nWith historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.\n\n\n== Title ==\nThe title of the book derives from a poem by author Richard Wright, who moved from the South to Chicago in the 1920s. The poem is excerpted here:\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nTIME 10 Best Nonfiction Books of the Decade\nNew York University Arthur L.

    "description": "Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents is a nonfiction book by the American journalist Isabel Wilkerson, published in August 2020 by Random House.

    "full_narrative": "Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents is a nonfiction book by the American journalist Isabel Wilkerson, published in August 2020 by Random House. The book describes racism in the United States as an aspect of a caste system—a society-wide system of social stratification characterized by notions such as hierarchy, inclusion and exclusion, and purity. Wilkerson does so by comparing aspects of the experience of American people of color to the caste systems of India and Nazi Germany, and she explores the impact of caste on societies shaped by them, and their people.\nCaste, which followed Wilkerson's 2010 book The Warmth of Other Suns, was met with critical acclaim and commercial success. It won or was nominated for several awards, and was featured prominently on nonfiction bestsellers lists and year-end best-books lists. It received a film adaptation in 2023, Origin, written and directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\n\n=== Pillars of caste ===\nIn Caste, Wilkerson identifies eight \"pillars of caste\", or features of caste systems in various societies:\n\nDivine will: the belief that social stratification is beyond human control, either divinely ordained or a natural law, as in the biblical story of the curse of Ham that was used to justify Black inferiority in the U.S.\nHeritability: the belief that social status is acquired at birth and immutable, as codified e.g. in the U.S. \"one-drop rule\" that determined Black ancestry\nEndogamy: the prohibition of sex and marriage between castes, as in the former U.S. anti-miscegenation laws\nPurity and pollution: the belief that the dominant caste is \"pure\" and must be protected against pollution by the inferior castes, as shown in the segregation of facilities for bathing, eating, education, etc. in the U.S. Jim Crow era\nOccupational hierarchy: the reservation of the more desirable occupations for the superior castes, as enshrined in U.S. Jim Crow laws that restricted Black people to farm or domestic work\nDehumanization and stigma: the denial of individuality and human dignity of lower-caste individuals, as through the various arbitrary punishments and restrictions to which enslaved and free Black people were subject to in the U.S., down to racist carnival games.\nTerror and cruelty: as means of enforcement of the caste system and control of lower-caste people, as through the whippings of slaves or the lynchings of Black people in the U.S.\nInherent superiority and inferiority of castes: the belief that people of one caste are inherently superior to those of other castes, expressed e.g. in restrictions on clothing or displays of status by lower-caste people, such as driving a car.\nWilkerson illustrates these pillars through examples from three caste systems: those of India, Nazi Germany and the United States.\n\n\n=== Aspects and consequences of caste ===\nShe goes on to describe the \"tentacles of caste\": the various ways in which a caste system society permeates the workings of a society infected by it. These include the anxious efforts of upper-caste people to retain their superior social status even while their economic status crumbles, hence the \"necessity of a bottom rung\", or the perceived need to prevent lower-caste success, unconscious biases embedded in a society's culture that perpetuate the caste system, or the function of lower-caste people as scapegoats.\nIn her view, the caste framework helps to explain the participation of lower-caste people (Jewish kapos, Black police officers) in the oppression of their fellow caste members: caste systems self-perpetuate by rewarding those lower-caste people who comply with the system, thereby keeping the lower castes divided.\nWilkerson continues by describing the \"consequences of caste\", which degrade people of all castes. Among them are the \"narcissism of caste\", which makes culture revolve around and idealize the dominant caste, or the Stockholm syndrome that serves as a survival mechanism for lower-caste people but helps keep them captive, or the physiological stress experienced by lower-caste people that reduces their life expectancy. She addresses the mechanisms of backlash against attempts to transcend the caste system, as exemplified by the first lower-caste U.S. president (Barack Obama) being succeeded by one intent on reinforcing the system (Donald Trump), and the importance of the \"symbols of caste\", such as swastikas or Confederate flags, to the perpetuation of the system.\nShe concludes that societies in the grip of a caste system pay a harsh price for it: the distrust between castes translates into brutal criminal justice systems, and minimal or dysfunctional public health or social welfare systems – and as a result, a reduction in welfare for all but the most affluent, compared to other societies. In Wilkerson's view, the comparatively poor performance of the U.S. in the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the high rate at which it impacts lower-caste Americans, are one example of such effects.\nWilkerson asks whether a \"world without caste [that] would set everyone free\" can exist. She concludes that it is possible – as in the dismantlement of Nazism after World War II – but that it requires both the bravery of individuals and an enormous effort of collective will especially by the dominant caste, given how deeply caste systems, like a chronic disease, are embedded in and shape societies.\n\n\n=== Race and caste ===\nWilkerson argues that the social constructs of race and caste are not synonyms, but that they \"can and do coexist in the same culture and serve to reinforce each other. Race, in the United States, is the visible agent of the unseen force of caste. Caste is the bones, race the skin.\"\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nNetflix produced a film adaptation of the book, titled Origin and directed by Ava DuVernay. The film, starring Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Jon Bernthal, Vera Farmiga and Niecy Nash-Betts, had its world premiere at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 6, 2023 and a theatrical release in the U.S. in January 2024. It received generally favorable reviews.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe book received starred reviews in Publishers Weekly, The Library Journal, Kirkus, and Booklist, and was also reviewed by Kwame Anthony Appiah, Dwight Garner, Gillian Tett, Fatima Bhutto, Kenneth W. Mack, Sunil Khilnani, Gaiutra Bahadur, Emily Bernard, Lauren Michele Jackson, Carlo Wolff, Colin Grant, Mihir Bose, Matthew Syed, and Yashica Dutt, among others.\nKwame Anthony Appiah, for the cover story of The New York Times Book Review in August 2020, wrote that the book is \"elegant and persuasive\" and that it \"is at once beautifully written and painful to read.\" Dwight Garner, in The New York Times, described Caste as \"an instant American classic and almost certainly the keynote nonfiction book of the American century thus far.\" Publishers Weekly called Caste a \"powerful and extraordinarily timely social history\" in its starred review of the book. The Chicago Tribune wrote that Caste was \"among the year's best\" books, while The Washington Post called the epilogue \"a prayer for a country in pain, offering new directions through prophetic language\".\nTunku Varadarajan gave the book a mixed review, writing that Wilkerson \"never offers a convincing argument for why American history and society are better examined through the lens of caste than of race\" and \"scarcely acknowledges that modern America has made vast strides to address racism.\" Time magazine called the book a \"transformative new framework through which to understand identity and injustice in America.\"\nThe New York Journal of Books commended Wilkerson's body of work, writing, \"Caste draws heavily on the powerful mingling of narrative, research, and visionary, sweeping insight that made Wilkerson's The Warmth of Other Suns the definitive contemporary study of African Americans' twentieth-century Great Migration from the Jim Crow South to northern, midwestern, and western cities. It deepens the resonance of that book (a seemingly impossible feat) by digging more explicitly into the pervasive racial hierarchy that transcends region and time.\"\nOprah Winfrey, after choosing the book for her 2020 Summer/Fall book club selection, said: \"Of all the books I've chosen for book club over the decades, there isn't another that is more essential a read than this one.\" The book was also listed as one of Barack Obama's favorite books of 2020.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nCaste's honors include the 2020 Goodreads Choice Award for History & Biography,the AudioFile Earphones Award for the audiobook edition in 2020., the Carl Sandburg Literary Award and the New York University Axinn Foundation Prize. The book was a finalist for the 2020 Kirkus Prize, the 2020 National Book Critics Circle Award, and the 2021 PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction. Caste was longlisted for the 2020 National Book Award for Nonfiction, the 2021 PEN/Jean Stein Book Award, and the 2021 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction.\nIn December 2020, Literary Hub analyzed 41 year-end best-books lists and reported that the book was among the most recommended of the year, making fifteen of the analyzed lists. The lists include Time, who placed Caste at the top of its list of the 10 Best Nonfiction Books of 2020, calling it an \"electrifying work that reframes injustice and inequity in the U.S.\"\n\n\n== Release details ==\nThe book became a number one New York Times nonfiction best-seller in early November 2020 and, as of the September 26, 2021, issue, had spent 58 weeks on The Times nonfiction best sellers list. It is also a USA Today Best Seller, having debuted on August 13, 2020, the book peaked at number three and has spent 21 weeks on the list as of January 5, 2021. According to Publishers Weekly, the book had sold over half a million copies by the close of 2020.\n\nHardcover: Wilkerson, Isabel (4 August 2020). Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents.

Shirer in which the author chronicles the rise and fall of Nazi Germany from the birth of Adolf Hitler in 1889 to the end of World War II in Europe in 1945. It was first published in 1960 by Simon & Schuster in the United States. It was a bestseller in both the United States and Europe, and a critical success outside Germany; in Germany, criticism of the book stimulated sales. The book was feted by journalists, as reflected by its receipt of the National Book Award for non-fiction,\nbut the reception from academic historians was mixed.\nThe book is based upon captured Nazi documents, the available diaries of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, of General Franz Halder, and of the Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, evidence and testimony from the Nuremberg trials, British Foreign Office reports, and the author's recollection of his six years in Germany (from 1934 to 1940) as a journalist, reporting on Nazi Germany for newspapers, the United Press International (UPI), and CBS Radio.\n\n\n== Content and themes ==\nThe Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is Shirer's comprehensive historical interpretation of the Nazi era, positing that German history logically proceeded from Martin Luther to Adolf Hitler; and that Hitler's accession to power was an expression of German national character, not of totalitarianism as an ideology that was internationally fashionable in the 1930s. The author summarised his perspective: \"[T]he course of German history ... made blind obedience to temporal rulers the highest virtue of Germanic man, and put a premium on servility.\" This  Sonderweg (special path or unique course) interpretation of German history was then common in American scholarship. Yet, despite extensive references, some academic critics consider its interpretation of Nazism to be flawed. The book also includes (identified) speculation, such as the theory that SS Chief Heinrich Müller afterward joined the NKVD of the USSR.\n\n\n== Development history ==\nThe editor for the book was Joseph Barnes, a foreign editor of the New York Herald Tribune, a former editor of PM, another New York newspaper, and a former speechwriter for Wendell Willkie. Barnes was an old friend of Shirer. The manuscript was very late and Simon & Schuster threatened to cancel the contract several times; each time Barnes would win a reprieve for Shirer. The book took more than five years to write, and Shirer ran out of money long before it was completed.  Frank Altschul's family project, the Overbrook Foundation, came to the rescue in the summer of 1958, when Shirer was \"flat broke\" and desperate.  At the recommendation of Hamilton Fish Armstrong the Overbrook Foundation advanced immediately to Shirer $5,000 ($52,500 in 2024 dollars) and promised another $5,000 six months later, enabling Shirer to finish his monumental book.  In the third volume of his autobiography, Shirer wrote:  \"This saved my life and my book . . . and I settled back to fourteen hours a day of writing.\" \nThe original title of the book was Hitler's Nightmare Empire with The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich as the sub-title. The title and cover had already been sent out in catalogs when Robert Gottlieb decided that both title and cover had to be changed. He also chose to publish the book as a single volume rather than two as originally planned. Nina Bourne decided that they should use the sub-title as the title and art director Frank Metz designed the black jacket bearing the swastika. Initially bookstores across the country protested displaying the swastika and threatened not to stock the book. The controversy soon blew over and the cover shipped with the symbol.\n\n\n== Success and acclaim ==\nIn the U.S., where it was published on October 17, 1960, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich sold more than one million hardcover copies, two-thirds via the Book of the Month Club, and more than one million paperback copies. In 1961, Simon & Schuster sold the paperback rights to Fawcett Publications for $400,000 (equivalent to $4.21 million in 2024). It won the 1961 National Book Award for Nonfiction and the Carey–Thomas Award for non-fiction.\nIn 1962, the Reader's Digest magazine serialization reached some 12 million additional readers. In a New York Times Book Review, Hugh Trevor-Roper praised it as \"a splendid work of scholarship, objective in method, sound in judgment, inescapable in its conclusions.\"\nThe book sold well in Britain, France, Italy, and in West Germany, because of its international recognition, bolstered by German editorial attacks.\nBoth its recognition by journalists as a great history book and its popular success surprised Shirer, as the publisher had commissioned a first printing of merely 12,500 copies. More than fifteen years after the end of the Second World War, neither Shirer nor the publisher had anticipated much popular interest in Adolf Hitler or in Nazi Germany.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nNearly all journalists praised the book. Many scholars acknowledged Shirer's achievement but some condemned it. The harshest criticism came from those who disagreed with the Sonderweg or \"Luther to Hitler\" thesis.  In West Germany, the Sonderweg interpretation was almost universally rejected in favor of the view that Nazism was simply one instance of totalitarianism that arose in various countries. Gavriel Rosenfeld asserted in 1994 that Rise and Fall was unanimously condemned by German historians in the 1960s, and considered dangerous to relations between America and West Germany, as it might inflame anti-German sentiments in the United States.\nKlaus Epstein listed what he contended were \"four major failings\": a crude understanding of German history; a lack of balance, leaving important gaps; no understanding of a modern totalitarian regime; and ignorance of current scholarship of the Nazi period.\nElizabeth Wiskemann concluded in a review that the book was \"not sufficiently scholarly nor sufficiently well written to satisfy more academic demands... It is too long and cumbersome... Mr Shirer, has, however compiled a manual... which will certainly prove useful.\"\nNearly 36 years after the book's publication, LGBT activist Peter Tatchell criticized the book's treatment of the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany. In the philosopher Jon Stewart's anthology The Hegel Myths and Legends (1996), The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is listed as a work that has propagated \"myths\" about the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\nIn 2004, the historian Richard J. Evans, author of The Third Reich Trilogy (2003–2008), said that Rise and Fall is a \"readable general history of Nazi Germany\" and that \"there are good reasons for [its] success.\" However, he contended that Shirer worked outside the academic mainstream and that Shirer's account was not informed by the historical scholarship of the time.\n\n\n== Adaptation and publication ==\n\nA television adaptation was broadcast in the United States on the ABC television network in 1968, consisting of a one-hour episode aired each night over three nights.\nThe book has been reprinted many times since it was published in 1960. The 1990 edition contained an afterword whereby Shirer gave a brief discourse on how his book was received when it was initially published and the future for Germany during German reunification in the atomic age. The 2011 edition contains a new introduction by Ron Rosenbaum.

Critics, including professor Chris Beneke and Randall J. Stephens, assert blatant omissions of important historical episodes, uncritical reliance on biased sources, and failure to examine opposing views. Conversely, others have defended Zinn and the accuracy and intellectual integrity of his work.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nIn a letter responding to a 2007 critical review of his A Young People's History of the United States (a release of the title for younger readers) in The New York Times Book Review, Zinn wrote:\n\nMy history ... describes the inspiring struggle of those who have fought slavery and racism (Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Fannie Lou Hamer, Bob Moses), of the labor organizers who have led strikes for the rights of working people (Big Bill Haywood, Mother Jones, César Chávez), of the socialists and others who have protested war and militarism (Eugene V. Debs, Helen Keller, the Rev. Daniel Berrigan, Cindy Sheehan). My hero is not Theodore Roosevelt, who loved war and congratulated a general after a massacre of Filipino villagers at the turn of the century, but Mark Twain, who denounced the massacre and satirized imperialism.\nI want young people to understand that ours is a beautiful country, but it has been taken over by men who have no respect for human rights or constitutional liberties. Our people are basically decent and caring, and our highest ideals are expressed in the Declaration of Independence, which says that all of us have an equal right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" The history of our country, I point out in my book, is a striving, against corporate robber barons and war makers, to make those ideals a reality—and all of us, of whatever age, can find immense satisfaction in becoming part of that.\n\n\n=== Columbus to independence ===\nChapter 1, \"Columbus, the Indians, and Human Progress\" covers early Native American civilization in North America and the Bahamas, the enslavement committed by the crew of Christopher Columbus (whom Zinn accused of genocide), and incidents of violent colonization by early settlers. Instead of restating the same history that has been presented for centuries, Zinn states that he prefers to tell history from the perspective of the Arawaks, which many people are not familiar with. He describes the purpose of Columbus' expedition and his brutality towards the natives after his arrival. Not only does he use firsthand account of witnesses to Columbus' presence in the islands, he also provides statistics of native casualties to present this different side of history. Topics include the Arawaks, Bartolomé de las Casas, the Aztecs, Hernán Cortés, Pizarro, Powhatan, the Pequot, the Narragansett, Metacom, King Philip's War, and the Iroquois.\nChapter 2, \"Drawing the Color Line\" addresses the slave trade and servitude of poor White people in the Thirteen Colonies. Zinn writes of the methods by which he says racism was created artificially in order to enforce the economic system. He argues that racism is not natural because there are recorded instances of camaraderie and cooperation between enslaved Blacks and White servants in escaping from and in opposing their subjugation.\nChapter 3, \"Persons of Mean and Vile Condition\" describes Bacon's Rebellion (1676), the economic conditions of the poor in the colonies, and opposition to their poverty. Zinn uses Nathaniel Bacon's rebellion to assert that \"class lines hardened through the colonial period\".\nChapter 4, \"Tyranny Is Tyranny\" covers the movement for \"leveling\" (economic equality) in the colonies and the causes of the American Revolution. Zinn argues that the Founding Fathers agitated for war to distract the people from their own economic problems and to stop popular movements, a strategy that he claims the country's leaders would continue to use in the future.\nChapter 5, \"A Kind of Revolution\" covers the war and resistance to participating in war, the effects on the Native American people, and the continued inequalities in the new United States. When the land of veterans of the Revolutionary War was seized for non-payment of taxes, it led to instances of resistance to the government, as in the case of Shays' Rebellion. Zinn notes that \"Charles Beard warned us that governments—including the government of the United States—are not neutral ... they represent the dominant economic interests, and ... their constitutions are intended to serve these interests.\"\n\n\n=== Independence to the robber barons ===\nChapter 6, \"The Intimately Oppressed\" describes resistance to inequalities in the lives of women in the early years of the U.S. Zinn tells the stories of women who resisted the status quo, including Polly Baker, Anne Hutchinson, Mary Dyer, Amelia Bloomer, Catharine Beecher, Emma Willard, Harriot Kezia Hunt, Elizabeth Blackwell, Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Margaret Fuller, Sarah Grimké, Angelina Grimké, Dorothea Dix, Frances Wright, Lucretia Mott, and Sojourner Truth.\n\nChapter 7, \"As Long As Grass Grows or Water Runs\" discusses 19th century conflicts between the U.S. government and Native Americans (such as the Seminole Wars) and Indian removal, especially during the administrations of Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren.\nChapter 8, \"We Take Nothing by Conquest, Thank God\" describes the Mexican–American War. Zinn writes that President James Polk agitated for war for the purpose of imperialism. Zinn argues that the war was unpopular, but that some newspapers of that era misrepresented the popular sentiment.\nChapter 9, \"Slavery Without Submission, Emancipation Without Freedom\" addresses slave rebellions, the abolition movement, the Civil War, and the effect of these events on African-Americans. Zinn writes that the large-scale violence of the war was used to end slavery instead of the small-scale violence of the rebellions because the latter may have expanded beyond anti-slavery, resulting in a movement against the capitalist system. He writes that the war could limit the freedom granted to African-Americans by allowing the government control over how that freedom was gained.\nChapter 10, \"The Other Civil War\", covers the Anti-Rent movement, the Dorr Rebellion, the Flour Riot of 1837, the New York City draft riots, the Molly Maguires, the rise of labor unions, the Lowell girls movement, and other class struggles centered around the various depressions of the 19th century. He describes the abuse of government power by corporations and the efforts by workers to resist those abuses.\nChapter 11, \"Robber Barons and Rebels\" covers the rise of industrial corporations such as the railroads and banks and their transformation into the nation's dominant institutions, with corruption resulting in both industry and government. Also covered are the popular movements and individuals that opposed corruption, such as the Knights of Labor, Edward Bellamy, the Socialist Labor Party, the Haymarket martyrs, the Homestead strikers, Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, Eugene V. Debs, the American Railway Union, the Farmers' Alliance, and the Populist Party.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nChapter 12, \"The Empire and the People\", covers American imperialism during the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War, as well as in other lands such as Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The Teller Amendment is discussed. Zinn portrays the wars as racist and imperialist and opposed by large segments of the American people.\nChapter 13, \"The Socialist Challenge\", covers the rise of socialism and anarchism as popular political ideologies in the United States. Covered in the chapter are the American Federation of Labor (which Zinn argues provided too exclusive of a union for non-white, female, and unskilled workers; Zinn argues in Chapter 24 that this changes in the 1990s), Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones, Joe Hill, the Socialist Labor Party, W. E. B. Du Bois, and the Progressive Party (which Zinn portrays as driven by fear of radicalism).\nChapter 14, \"War Is the Health of the State\" covers World War I and the anti-war movement that happened during it, which was met with the heavily enforced Espionage Act of 1917. Zinn argues that the United States entered the war in order to expand its foreign markets and economic influence.\nChapter 15, \"Self-Help in Hard Times\" covers the government's campaign to destroy the IWW, and the factors leading to the Great Depression. Zinn states that, despite popular belief, the 1920s were not a time of prosperity, and the problems of the Depression were simply the chronic problems of the poor extended to the rest of the society. Also covered is the Communist Party's attempts to help the poor during the Depression. He criticizes some aspects of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal: \"From the first, the NRA was dominated by big business and served their interests.\" According to Zinn, the New Deal was aimed mainly at stabilizing the economy and \"secondly at giving enough help to the lower classes to keep them from turning a rebellion into a real revolution\".\nChapter 16, \"A People's War?\", covers World War II, opposition to it, and the effects of the war on the people. Zinn, a veteran of the war himself, notes that \"it was the most popular war the US ever fought\", but states that this support may have been manufactured through the institutions of American society. He cites various instances of opposition to fighting (in some cases greater than those during World War I) as proof. Zinn also argues that the US's true intention was not fighting against systematic racism, since the US had this itself, such as with the Jim Crow laws (leading to opposition to the war from African-Americans). In accordance with American revisionist historian Gar Alperovitz, another argument made by Zinn is that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not necessary, as the U.S. government had already known that the Japanese were considering surrender beforehand, and it was \"most anxious to get the Japanese affair over with before the Russians got in\". Other subjects from WWII covered include Japanese American internment and the bombing of Dresden. The chapter continues into the Cold War, which Zinn writes was used by the U.S. government to increase control over the American people (for instance, eliminating such radical elements as the Communist Party) and at the same time create a state of permanent war, which allowed for the creation of the military–industrial complex. Zinn believes this was possible because both conservatives and liberals willingly worked together in the name of anti-Communism. Also covered is US involvement in the Greek Civil War, the Korean War, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the Marshall Plan and the Cuban Revolution.\nChapter 17, \"'Or Does It Explode?'\" (named after a line from Langston Hughes's poem \"Harlem\" from \"Montage of a Dream Deferred\", referred to as \"Lenox Avenue Mural\" by Zinn), covers the Civil Rights Movement. Zinn argues that the government began making reforms against discrimination (although without making fundamental changes) for the sake of changing its international image, but often did not enforce the laws that it passed. Zinn also argues that while nonviolent tactics may have been required for Southern civil rights activists, militant actions (such as those proposed by Malcolm X) were needed to solve the problems of black ghettos. Also covered is the involvement of the Communist Party in the movement, the Congress of Racial Equality, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the Freedom Riders, COINTELPRO, and the Black Panther Party.\nChapter 18, \"The Impossible Victory: Vietnam\", covers the Vietnam War and resistance to it. Zinn argues that America was fighting a war that it could not win, as the Vietnamese people were in favor of the government of Ho Chi Minh and opposed the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem, thus allowing them to keep morale high. Meanwhile, the American military's morale was very low, as many soldiers were put off by the atrocities which they were made to take part in, such as the My Lai massacre. Zinn also tries to dispel the popular belief that opposition to the war was mainly among college students and middle-class intellectuals, using statistics from the era to show higher opposition from the working class. Zinn argues that the troops themselves also opposed the war, citing desertions and refusals to go to war, as well as movements such as Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Also covered is the US invasions of Laos and Cambodia, Agent Orange, the Pentagon Papers, Ron Kovic, and raids on draft boards.\nChapter 19, \"Surprises\", covers other movements that happened during the 1960s, such as second-wave feminism, the prison reform/prison abolition movement, the Native American rights movement, and the counterculture. People and events from the feminist movement covered include Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell, Patricia Robinson, the National Domestic Workers Union, National Organization for Women, Roe v. Wade, Susan Brownmiller's Against Our Will, and Our Bodies, Ourselves. People and events from the prison movement covered include George Jackson, the Attica Prison riots, and Jerry Sousa. People and events from the Native American rights movement covered include the National Indian Youth Council, Sid Mills, Akwesasne Notes, Indians of All Tribes, the First Convocation of American Indian Scholars, Frank James, the American Indian Movement, and the Wounded Knee incident. People and events from the counterculture covered include Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Malvina Reynolds, Jessica Mitford's The American Way of Death, Jonathan Kozol, George Dennison, and Ivan Illich.\nChapter 20, \"The Seventies: Under Control?\", covers political corruption and American disillusion with the government during the 1970s. Zinn argues that the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the exposure of crimes committed by the CIA and FBI during the decade were done by the government in order to regain support from the American people without making fundamental changes to the system.  According to Zinn, Gerald Ford's presidency continued the same basic policies of the Nixon administration. Other topics covered include protests against the Honeywell Corporation, Angela Davis, Committee to Re-elect the President, the Watergate scandal, International Telephone and Telegraph's involvement in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, the Mayagüez incident, Project MKUltra, the Church Committee, the Pike Committee, the Trilateral Commission's The Governability of Democracies, and the People's Bi-Centennial.\nChapter 21, \"Carter-Reagan-Bush: The Bipartisan Consensus\", covers the Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush administrations and their effects on both the American people and foreign countries. Zinn argues that the Democratic and Republican parties keep the government essentially the same, maintaining policies favorable for corporations and a militant foreign policy, no matter which party was in power. Zinn uses similarities among the three administrations' methods to argue for this. Other topics covered include the Fairness Doctrine, the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, Noam Chomsky, global warming, Roy Benavidez, the Trident submarine, the Star Wars program, the Sandinista National Liberation Front, the Iran–Contra affair, the War Powers Act, U.S. invasion of Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War, the Invasion of Grenada, Óscar Romero, the El Mozote massacre, the 1986 Bombing of Libya, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States invasion of Panama, and the Gulf War.\nChapter 22, \"The Unreported Resistance\", covers several movements that happened during the Carter-Reagan-Bush years that were ignored by much of the mainstream media. Topics covered include the anti-nuclear movement, the Plowshares Movement, the Council for a Nuclear Weapons Freeze, the Physicians for Social Responsibility, George Kistiakowsky, The Fate of the Earth, Marian Wright Edelman, the Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes, the Three Mile Island accident, the Winooski 44, Abbie Hoffman, Amy Carter, the Piedmont Peace Project, Anne Braden, César Chávez, the United Farm Workers, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, Teatro Campesino, LGBT social movements, the Stonewall riots, Food Not Bombs, the anti-war movement during the Gulf War, David Barsamian, opposition to Columbus Day, Indigenous Thought, Rethinking Schools, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\nChapter 23, \"The Coming Revolt of the Guards\", covers Zinn's theory on a possible future radical movement against inequality in America. Zinn argues that there will eventually be a movement made up not only of groups previously involved in radical change (such as labor organizers, black radicals, Native Americans, feminists), but also members of the middle class who are starting to become discontented with the state of the nation. Zinn expects this movement to use \"demonstrations, marches, civil disobedience; strikes and boycotts and general strikes; direct action to redistribute wealth, to reconstruct institutions, to revamp relationships\".\nChapter 24, \"The Clinton Presidency\", covers the effects of the Bill Clinton administration on the U.S. and the world. Zinn argues that despite Clinton's claims that he would bring change, his presidency kept many things the same. Topics covered include Jocelyn Elders, the Waco siege, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Crime Bill of 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, the 1993 bombing of Iraq, Operation Gothic Serpent, the Rwandan genocide, the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1998 bombing of Afghanistan and Sudan, the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed, Stand for Children, Jesse Jackson, the Million Man March, Mumia Abu-Jamal, John Sweeney, the Service Employees International Union, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, the Worker Rights Consortium, the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Spare Change News, the North American Street Newspaper Association, the National Coalition for the Homeless, anti-globalization, and WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity.\nChapter 25, \"The 2000 Election and the 'War On Terrorism'\", covers the 2000 presidential election and the War on Terrorism. Zinn argues that attacks on the U.S. by Arab terrorists (such as the September 11, 2001 attacks) are not caused by a hatred for our freedom (as claimed by President George W. Bush), but by grievances with U.S. foreign policies such as \"stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia ... sanctions against Iraq which ... had resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children; [and] the continued U.S. support of Israel's occupation of land claimed by Palestinians.\" Other topics covered include Ralph Nader, and the War in Afghanistan.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWhen A People's History of the United States was published in 1980, future Columbia University historian Eric Foner reviewed it in The New York Times:\n\nProfessor Zinn writes with an enthusiasm rarely encountered in the leaden prose of academic history, and his text is studded with telling quotations from labor leaders, war resisters and fugitive slaves. There are vivid descriptions of events that are usually ignored, such as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and the brutal suppression of the Philippine independence movement at the turn of this century. Professor Zinn's chapter on Vietnam—bringing to life once again the free-fire zones, secret bombings, massacres and cover-ups—should be required reading for a new generation of students now facing conscription. Nonetheless, A People's History reflects a deeply pessimistic vision of the American experience ... Uprisings are either crushed, deflected or co-opted ... Why such movements so often fail to achieve their goals is never adequately explained ... The portrayal of these anonymous Americans, moreover, is strangely circumscribed. Blacks, Indians, women, and laborers appear either as rebels or as victims. Less dramatic but more typical lives—people struggling to survive with dignity in difficult circumstances—receive little attention. Nor does Professor Zinn stop to explore the ideologies that inspired the various uprisings he details.\nFoner continues by remarking that \"history from the bottom up, though necessary as a corrective, is as limited in its own way as history from the top down.\" What is necessary, Foner asserts, is \"an integrated account incorporating Thomas Jefferson and his slaves, Andrew Jackson and the Indians, Woodrow Wilson and the Wobblies, in a continuous historical process, in which each group's experience is shaped in large measure by its relation to others.\"\nWriting in The New York Times, columnist Bob Herbert argued that \"Mr. Zinn was often taken to task for peeling back the rosy veneer of much of American history to reveal sordid realities that had remained hidden for too long.\" Herbert quotes from Zinn's account of the presidency of Andrew Jackson as an example of what he means. Also writing for The New York Times, columnist Michael Powell praised the text's impact on changing the perspective of modern histories:\n\nTo describe it as a revisionist account is to risk understatement. A conventional historical account held no allure; he concentrated on what he saw as the genocidal depredations of Christopher Columbus, the blood lust of Theodore Roosevelt and the racial failings of Abraham Lincoln. He also shined an insistent light on the revolutionary struggles of impoverished farmers, feminists, laborers and resisters of slavery and war. Such stories are more often recounted in textbooks today; they were not at the time.\nWriting in Dissent, Georgetown University history professor Michael Kazin argued that Zinn is too focused on class conflict, and wrongly attributes sinister motives to the American political elite. He characterized the book as an overly simplistic narrative of elite villains and oppressed people, with no attempt to understand historical actors in the context of the time in which they lived. Kazin wrote:\n\nThe ironic effect of such portraits of rulers is to rob 'the people' of cultural richness and variety, characteristics that might gain the respect and not just the sympathy of contemporary readers. For Zinn, ordinary Americans seem to live only to fight the rich and haughty and, inevitably, to be fooled by them.\nKazin argued that A People's History fails to explain why the American political-economic model continues to attract millions of minorities, women, workers, and immigrants, or why the socialist and radical political movements Zinn favors have failed to gain widespread support among the American public.\nSam Wineburg, a professor of history at Stanford University, criticizes Zinn's use of leading questions, cherry-picking of sources, and presentation of disputable claims as facts. Wineburg used as an example Zinn's claim that African Americans had \"widespread indifference, even hostility\" to the American war effort in World War II, which was supported by three quotes. According to Wineburg, Zinn drew the quotes from a book by Lawrence S. Wittner, but omitted evidence from the same pages that African Americans were underrepresented among draft evaders and conscientious objectors. Wineburg argued that the reason for the book's longtime appeal was that it \"speaks directly to our inner Holden Caulfield.\"\nWriting in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Christopher Phelps, associate professor of American studies in the School of American and Canadian Studies at the University of Nottingham wrote:\n\nProfessional historians have often viewed Zinn's work with exasperation or condescension, and Zinn was no innocent in the dynamic. I stood against the wall for a Zinn talk at the University of Oregon around the time of the 1992 Columbus Quincentenary. Listening to Zinn, one would have thought historians still considered Samuel Eliot Morison's 1955 book on Columbus to be definitive. The crowd lapped it up, but Zinn knew better. He missed a chance to explain how the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s have transformed the writing and teaching of history, how his People's History did not spring out of thin air but was an effort to synthesize a widely shared shift in historical sensibilities. Zinn's historical theorizing, conflating objectivity with neutrality and position with bias, was no better.\nThe critics would be churlish, however, not to acknowledge the moving example Zinn set in the civil-rights and Vietnam movements, and they would be remiss not to note the value of A People's History, along with its limitations. Zinn told tales well, stories that, while familiar to historians, often remained unknown to wider publics. He challenged national pieties and encouraged critical reflection about received wisdom. He understood that America's various radicalisms, far from being \"un-American,\" have propelled the nation toward more humane and democratic arrangements. And he sold two-million copies of a work of history in a culture that is increasingly unwilling to read and, consequently, unable to imagine its past very well.\nIn The New York Times Book Review in a review of A Young People's History of the United States, volumes 1 and 2, novelist Walter Kirn wrote:\n\nThat America is not a better place—that it finds itself almost globally despised, mired in war, self-doubt and random violence—is also a fact, of course, but not one that Zinn's brand of history seems equal to. His stick-figure pageant of capitalist cupidity can account, in its fashion, for terrorism—as when, in the second volume, subtitled \"Class Struggle to the War on Terror,\" he notes that Sept. 11 was an assault on \"symbols of American wealth and power\"—but it doesn't address the themes of religious zealotry, technological change and cultural confusion that animate what I was taught in high school to label \"current events\" but that contemporary students may as well just call \"the weirdness.\" The line from Columbus to Columbine, from the first Independence Day to the Internet, and from the Boston Tea Party to Baghdad is a wandering line, not a party line. As for the \"new possibilities\" it points to, I can't see them clearly.\nProfessors Michael Kazin, Michael Kammen and Mary Grabar condemn the book as a black-and-white story of elite villains and oppressed victims, a story that robs American history of its depth and intricacy and leaves nothing but an empty text simplified to the level of propaganda.\n\n\n== Other editions and related works ==\nA version of the book titled The Twentieth Century contains only chapters 12–25 (\"The Empire and the People\" to \"The 2000 Election and the 'War on Terrorism'\"). Although it was originally meant to be an expansion of the original book, recent editions of A People's History now contain all of the later chapters from it. In 2004, Zinn and Anthony Arnove published a collection of more than 200 primary source documents titled Voices of a People's History of the United States, available both as a book and as a CD of dramatic readings. Writer Aaron Sarver notes that although Kazin \"savaged\" Zinn's A People's History of the United States, \"one of the few concessions Kazin made was his approval of Zinn punctuating 'his narrative with hundreds of quotes from slaves and Populists, anonymous wage-earners and ... articulate radicals'\".\nSarver argued that, whether Zinn intended it or not, Voices served as a useful response to Kazin's critique. \"Voices is a vast anthology that tells heartbreaking and uplifting stories of American history. Kazin will be hard-pressed to charge Zinn with politicizing the intelligence here; the volume offers only Zinn's sparse introductions to each piece, letting the actors and their words speak for themselves.\" In 2008, Zinn worked with Mike Konopacki and Paul Buhle on creating A People's History of American Empire, a graphic novel that covers various historic subjects drawn from A People's History of the United States as well as Zinn's own history of his involvement in activism and historic events as covered in his autobiography You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train. Zinn worked as the editor for a series of books under the A People's History label. This series expands upon the issues and historic events covered in A People's History of the United States by giving them in-depth coverage, and also covers the history of parts of the world outside the United States. These books include:\n\nA People's History of the Supreme Court by Peter Irons with foreword by Zinn \nA People's History of Sports in the United States by Dave Zirin with an introduction by Howard Zinn\nA People's History of American Empire by Howard Zinn, Mike Konopacki, and Paul Buhle\nThe Darker Nations: A People's History of the Third World by Vijay Prashad\nA People's History of the American Revolution by Ray Raphael\nA People's History of the Civil War by David Williams\nA People's History of the Vietnam War by Jonathan Neale\nThe Mexican Revolution: A People's History by Adolfo Gilly\nLikewise, other books were inspired by the series:\n\nA People's History of Australia from 1788 to the Present edited by Verity Burgmann. A four-volume series that looks at Australian history thematically, not chronologically.\nA People's History of Science: Miners, Midwives, and Low Mechanicks by Clifford D Connor.\nA People's History of the World by Chris Harman. It is endorsed by Zinn.\nA People's History of Christianity by Diana Butler Bass.\nThe Assassination of Julius Caesar: A People's History of Ancient Rome by Michael Parenti. It is endorsed by Zinn.\nA People's History of Modern Europe by William A. Pelz\nLudowa historia Polski (A People's History of Poland) by Adam Leszczyński (2020)\nAn Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz. The third of a series of five books which reconstruct U.S. history from marginalized peoples' perspectives.\n\n\n=== Younger readers' version ===\nIn July 2007 Seven Stories Press released A Young People's History of the United States, an illustrated, two-volume adaptation of A People's History for young adult readers (ages 10–14). The new version, adapted from the original text by Rebecca Stefoff, is updated through the end of 2006, and includes a new introduction and afterword by Zinn. In his introduction, Zinn writes, \"It seems to me it is wrong to treat young readers as if they are not mature enough to look at their nation's policies honestly. I am not worried about disillusioning young people by pointing to the flaws in the traditional heroes.\" In the afterword, \"Rise like lions\", he asks young readers to \"Imagine the American people united for the first time in a movement for fundamental change.\" In addition, the New Press released an updated (2007) version of The Wall Charts for A People's History—a 2-piece fold-out poster featuring an illustrated timeline of U.S. history, with an explanatory booklet.\n\n\n=== Lessons for the classroom ===\nIn 2008, the Zinn Education Project was launched to promote and support the use of A People's History of the United States (and other materials) for teaching in middle and high school classrooms across the U.S. The goal of the project is to give American students Zinn's version of U.S. history. With funds from an anonymous donor who had been a student of Zinn's, the project began by distributing 4,000 packets to teachers in all states and territories. The project now offers teaching guides and bibliographies that can be freely downloaded.\n\n\n== Current editions ==\nZinn, Howard (2005). A People's History of the United States: 1492–present.

    "full_narrative": "The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a history book written by the American journalist and historian Richard Rhodes, first published by Simon & Schuster in 1987. The book won multiple awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. The narrative covers people and events from early 20th century discoveries leading to the science of nuclear fission, through the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBefore writing The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes already authored several fiction books, and worked as an independent journalist. He liked science writing, though his only training, in his own words, was \"a course at Yale that we called Physics for Poets\". When he started to work on the book he found out that \"the early papers in nuclear physics were written very clearly\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe book was praised both by historians and former Los Alamos weapon engineers and scientists, and is considered to be a general authority on early nuclear weapons history, as well as the development of modern physics in general, during the first half of the 20th century. Nobel Laureate I. I. Rabi, one of the prime participants in the dawn of the atomic age, called it \"an epic worthy of Milton. No where else have I seen the whole story put down with such elegance and gusto and in such revealing detail and simple language which carries the reader through wonderful and profound scientific discoveries and their application.\" As reported by The New York Times, Rabi's wife \"read him the whole book, and he was pleased with it\".\nLate Sir Solly Zuckerman wrote in his review: \"I have no doubt that his book will stand for years to come as an authoritative account of the way our nuclear age started. Above all, lengthy it is, it will be enjoyed as a magnificent read.\"\nThe historian of science Lawrence Badash writes positively about the book, but notes Rhodes' descriptions of sketchy biographies unconvincing: \"'human interest' material of questionable accuracy becomes psycho-babble\", though he notes that \"the book is accurate and the characters are well drawn\". He concludes that \"Altogether Rhodes has produced the most readable, exciting and just book to date that covers both the bomb and the preceding four decades\". \nWilliam J. Broad praised the book in The New York Times review, writing that it \"offers not only the best overview of the century's pivotal event, but a probing analysis of what it means for the future.\" He especially noted the vast bibliography, \"the characters speak in their own voices, in long paragraphs of direct quotation\". Another reviewer writes that \"If it is the bomb which defines the twentieth century as at once dreadful and rewarding ... then the present book captures this range\", and also praised the extensive bibliography. Another review calls it \"an exceptionally well-written account of the building and use of the first nuclear weapons\".\nSally Smith Hughes notes that while \"Rhodes is neither a scientist nor science writer\", this \"may explain the freshness of his approach and his ability to convey difficult science in layman's terms.\" She notes the usage of oral histories by the author: Rhodes writes about 21 participants of the events who \"generously made time for interviews and correspondence\"; he also used oral histories collected by the American Institute of Physics.\nBarton Bernstein praised the book, and called it \"a compelling book of drama and tragedy, of passion and commitment, and of moral lament. It is historical journalism on a grand scale, with rich detail, colorful scenes, recreated conversations, vivid portraits, and gripping vignettes chronicling the lengthy scientific and political roads to Hiroshima, and briefly beyond\". Besides that, his review also contains criticism, as he writes that sometimes \"narrative strategy ... neglects analysis, sometimes sacrifices the important to the vivid, and encourages an uncritical use of sources and possibly even skimpy archival research\".\nAngelo Collins of Stanford University also praised the book, noting that it \"is not a pleasure to read (it is thought provoking and makes the reader uneasy) and it is not easy to read (it is long and there are many characters and many settings). But it is fascinating.\" Carol S. Gruber writes that the \"comprehensiveness and the framework within which its main story unfolds, it broadens and deepens our understanding of the familiar subject; and it is a very good read.\"\nRobert Seidel in his essay on the books that cover the Manhattan Project writes that \"Rhodes's account is more comprehensive, thoughtful, and accurate than the standard popular history ... the book is a \"good read\" and makes use of reliable sources critically. We would ask little more of a professional history.\" \nBarton C. Hacker notes that it \"reads much like a novel and, like a good novel, can be hard to put down\", but also writes about what the book lacks:\n\nWhat the book lacks, however, is any sustained attention to the institutional shaping and constraint of events. A grant from the Rockefeller Foundation or a Nobel Prize arrives as a virtual deus ex machina just when a scientist needs to study in Berlin or flee fascism—no hint is given that such awards might be something other than natural phenomena. Even the Manhattan Project often seems more a matter of a physicist's views clashing with a soldier's, or a daring foray into the war zone to learn the status of German nuclear research, than the rapid construction and widespread operations of an enterprise that rivaled in size the prewar American automobile industry. Conducting experiments fills many more pages than building production plants.... I suspect Rhodes really wanted to write the epic of the atomic bomb, an \"Atomiad\" if you will. Maybe he has.\nMatthew Bunn notes Rhodes' descriptions of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, writing that they are \"excruciating, densely layered with gruesome but telling first-hand accounts of the horrors the bombs inflicted\"; he called the book \"a wide-ranging tale of the physics and engineering of the bomb, the personalities involved, and the larger story of how society came to think about war\".\nIn 2023, the book became popular among artificial intelligence researchers. The Atlantic reported that \"A generation of AI researchers treat Richard Rhodes's seminal book like a Bible as they develop technology with the potential to remake—or ruin—our world.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1988 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction\n1987 National Book Award for Nonfiction\n1987 National Book Critics Circle Award\n\n\n== Subsequent books ==\nIn 1992, Rhodes followed it up by compiling, editing, and writing the introduction to an annotated version of The Los Alamos Primer, by Manhattan Project scientist Robert Serber. The Primer was a set of lectures given to new arrivals at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory during wartime to get them up to speed about the prominent questions needing to be solved in bomb design, and had been largely declassified in 1965, but was not widely available.\nIn 1994, Rhodes published Nuclear Renewal: Common Sense about Energy detailing the history of the nuclear power industry in the United States, and future promises of nuclear power. In 1995 he published a sequel to The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb, which told the story of the atomic espionage during World War II, the debates over whether the hydrogen bomb ought to be produced, and the eventual creation of the bomb and its consequences for the arms race. In 2007, Rhodes published Arsenals of Folly: The Making of the Nuclear Arms Race, a chronicle of the arms buildups during the Cold War, especially focusing on Mikhail Gorbachev and the Reagan administration. The Twilight of the Bombs, the fourth and final volume in his series on nuclear history, was published in 2010. The book documents, among other topics, the post–Cold War nuclear history of the world, nuclear proliferation, and nuclear terrorism.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Making of the Atomic Bomb at Open Library",

Wolfe became fascinated with the astronauts, and his competitive spirit compelled him to try to outdo Norman Mailer's nonfiction book about the first Moon mission, Of a Fire on the Moon. He published a four-part series for Rolling Stone in 1973 titled \"Post-Orbital Remorse\", about the depression that some astronauts experienced after having been in space. After the series, Wolfe began researching the whole of the space program, in what became a seven-year project from which he took time to write The Painted Word, a book on art, and to complete Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine, a collection of shorter pieces.\nIn 1977 he returned to his astronaut book full-time. Wolfe originally planned to write a complete history of the space program, though after writing through the Mercury program, he felt that his work was complete and that it captured the astronauts' ethos—the \"right stuff\" that astronauts and test pilots of the 1940s and 1950s shared—the unspoken code of bravery and machismo that compelled these men to ride on top of dangerous rockets. While conducting research, he consulted with Yeager and, after receiving a comprehensive review of his manuscript, was convinced that test pilots like Yeager should form the backdrop of the period. In the end, Yeager becomes a personification of the many postwar test pilots and their \"right stuff\". The phrase itself may have originated in the Joseph Conrad story \"Youth\", where it was used.\nWolfe also consulted with Dr. David Hamburg, then head of the department of psychiatry at Stanford, to learn about the psychological aspects of space flight, and relate the experience from the pilot/astronauts' point of view.\nThe Right Stuff was published in 1979 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux and became Wolfe's best selling book yet. It was praised by most critics, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and won the National Book Award for Nonfiction.\nIn the foreword to a new edition, published in 1983 when the film adaptation was released, Wolfe wrote that his \"book grew out of some ordinary curiosity\" about what \"makes a man willing to sit up on top of an enormous Roman candle... and wait for someone to light the fuse\".\n\n\n== Book ==\n\nThe story is more about the space race than space exploration in general. The Soviet Union's early space efforts are mentioned only as background, focusing entirely on an early portion of the U.S. space program. Only Project Mercury, the first operational crewed space-flight program, is covered. The Mercury Seven were Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. Emphasis is given to the personal stories of the astronauts and their wives rather than the technical aspects of space travel and the flights themselves.\nThe storyline also involves the political reasons for putting people into space, asserting that the Mercury astronauts were actually a burden to the program and were only sent up for promotional reasons. Reasons for including living beings in spacecraft are barely touched upon, but the first option considered was to use a chimpanzee (and, indeed, chimpanzees were sent up first).\nAnother option considered was using athletes already accustomed to physical stress, such as circus trapeze artists. Wolfe states that President Dwight D. Eisenhower insisted on pilots, even though the first crew members would not actually fly the spacecraft. When Gus Grissom lands at sea and exits his space capsule, saving the capsule seems more important to the recovery team than saving the pilot because of the value of the data.\nWolfe contrasts the Seven with the Edwards AFB test pilots, among whom was Chuck Yeager, who was shut out of the astronaut program after NASA officials decided to use college-degreed pilots, not ones who gained their commissions as enlisted men, such as participants in the USAAF Flying Sergeants Program in World War II. Yeager spent time with Wolfe explaining accident reports \"that Wolfe kept getting all wrong\". Publishing insiders say these sessions between Wolfe and Yeager led Wolfe to highlight Yeager's character, presence, thoughts, and anecdotes throughout the book. As an example, Yeager prides his speech to the Society of Test Pilots that the first rider in the Mercury development program would be a monkey, not a real test pilot, and Wolfe plays this drama out on the angst felt by the Mercury astronauts over those remarks. Yeager himself downplayed the theory of \"the right stuff\", attributing his survival of potential catastrophes to simply knowing his airplane thoroughly, along with some good luck.\nAnother test pilot highlighted in the book is Scott Crossfield. Crossfield and Yeager were fierce but friendly rivals for speed and altitude records.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nA 3-hour, 13-minute film released in 1983 stars Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Barbara Hershey, Kim Stanley, Levon Helm, Veronica Cartwright, Pamela Reed, Lance Henriksen, and the real Chuck Yeager in a cameo appearance. NFL Hall of Famer Anthony Muñoz also has a small role, playing \"Gonzalez\". It features a score by composer Bill Conti.\nThe screenplay was adapted by director Philip Kaufman from the book. Screenwriter William Goldman, who had been attached to the film prior to the hiring of Kaufman, left the project after quarreling with Kaufman about story elements, including Goldman's excision of the Yeager narrative and the unabashedly jingoistic tone of his adaptation (spurred by the Iran hostage crisis).\nWhile the movie took liberties with certain historical facts as part of \"dramatic license\", criticism focused on one: the portrayal of Gus Grissom panicking when his Liberty Bell 7 spacecraft sank following splashdown. Most historians, as well as engineers working for or with NASA and many of the related contractor agencies within the aerospace industry, are now convinced that the premature detonation of the spacecraft hatch's explosive bolts was caused by failure not associated with direct human error or deliberate detonation at the hands of Grissom.\nThis determination had, in fact, been made long before the movie was filmed, and even Tom Wolfe's book only states that this possibility was considered, not that it was actually judged as being the cause of the accident. In fact, Grissom was assigned to command the first flights of both Gemini and Apollo. Grissom died in the Apollo 1 fire because there was no quick-opening hatch on the Block 1 Apollo Command Module—a design choice made because NASA had determined that the explosion in the hatch on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 had been most likely self-initiated.\nAnother fact that had been altered in the film was the statement by Trudy Cooper, who commented that she \"wondered how they would've felt if every time their husband went in to make a deal, there was a one-in-four chance he wouldn't come out of that meeting\". According to the book, this actually reflected the 23% chance of dying during a 20-year career as a normal pilot. For a test pilot, these odds were higher, at 53%, but were still considerably less than the movie implied. In addition, the movie merely used the fictional Mrs. Cooper as a vehicle for the statement; the real Mrs. Cooper is not known to have said this.\nWolfe made no secret that he disliked the film, especially because of changes from his original book. Goldman also disliked the choices made by Kaufman, saying in his 1983 book Adventures in the Screen Trade that \"Phil [Kaufman]'s heart was with Yeager. And not only that, he felt the astronauts, rather than being heroic, were really minor leaguers, mechanical men of no particular quality, not great pilots at all, simply the product of hype.\"\nCritics were generally favorable toward the film.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\nA television series, based on The Right Stuff and created by National Geographic, premiered October 9, 2020, on Disney+ as a Disney+ Original.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOf a Fire on the Moon (1970) by Norman Mailer, an account of the Apollo 11 Moon landing that inspired Wolfe to write The Right Stuff\nLost Moon (1994) by Jim Lovell, about the Apollo 13 mission\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nPublisher's blurb for The Right Stuff\nTom Wolfe's 1983 foreword to The Right Stuff",

    "full_narrative": "Truman is a 1992 biography of the 33rd president of the United States, Harry S. Truman, by the American historian David McCullough. It won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and was made into a 1995 television film by HBO.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe book provides a biography of Truman in chronological fashion from his birth to his rise to U.S. senator, vice president, and president. It follows his activities until death, exploring many of the major decisions he made as president, including his decision to drop the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, his meetings and confrontation with Joseph Stalin during the end of World War II, his decision to create the Marshall Plan, his decision to send troops to the Korean War, his decision to recognize the State of Israel, and his decision to racially desegregate the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nAfter writing Mornings on Horseback, which was his first biography and consisted of an in-depth look at a small period in the life of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, McCullough wanted to do a more full biography, \"a mural instead of a Vermeer.\" At first, McCullough attempted to write a biography about Pablo Picasso, but abandoned the project in favor of doing a book on Truman.\nMcCullough decided that he would structure the story of Truman's biography in chronological fashion. He explained his reasoning: \"It's been very fashionable lately to begin biographies anywhere but at the beginning, heaven forbid. But I didn't want to do anything tricky or fashionable because [Truman] was neither of those things. Harry Truman was a 19th-century man and I decided I would proceed as a great 19th-century biographer would, or as Dickens would.\"\nIn effort to better understand his subject, McCullough took several actions to emulate the life and activities of Truman. For instance, he would begin each day with a brisk early-morning walk, just as Harry S. Truman did. He also lived in Truman's hometown, Independence, Missouri, for a little while. He also raced through the United States Capitol retracing the path Truman ran when he was summoned to the White House after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nIn his research for the book, McCullough interviewed hundreds of people who knew Truman, including relatives and U.S. Secret Service agents, read numerous letters and documents, and read almost all the books written about Truman.\nWhile working on the book McCullough would read every draft page aloud to his wife and have her read the pages back to him. McCullough explained this practice by stating: \"You can hear things that you cannot see. Redundancies, awkward expressions. Painters often look at their work in the mirror because you can see flaws that you don't see looking straight at a canvas.\"\nMcCullough wrote Truman over a period of 10 years. He stated that during that 10 years many things changed in his life, \"In those 10 years, my youngest daughter changed from a girl into a woman, both my parents died, grandchildren were born, we moved our residence twice, we put a child through college and law school, and paid off a mortgage.\"\nMcCullough felt a compulsion to get the book finished before the 1992 presidential election period in response to the shallow political debates that were occurring in Washington, D.C.  McCullough said, \"I felt that something needed to be said before people made a choice. This book is about the country, not just about Harry Truman. It's about who we are and what we can be.\"\nWhile McCullough was able to gain insights into Truman based on his research, there were questions that remained unanswered to McCullough, such as why Truman's wife left him alone in Washington so often. The usual explanation among historians was that Bess hated the heat and her mother was ill, but McCullough has expressed doubts about this explanation stating that \"[Bess] was away so often and [Truman's] letters to her were so plaintive, his need for her to be there so real. I don't know.\"\nMcCullough has stated that he intended Truman to be not only for \"the Arthur Schlesingers and the academics\" but instead intended the book for \"your grandmother,\" and other common folk including present and future politicians so \"they may see, even when flawed, how great a man in [the office of the President] can be.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAfter the book was published, McCullough went on a book-tour. One of the largest crowds he encountered was when he went to the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri.  \nMost reviewers praised the book when it came out. One notable dissent was an article in The New Republic titled \"Harry of Sunnybrook Farm\" by Ronald Steel, in which Steel called the book a \"1000 page valentine.\"\nGene Lyons at Entertainment Weekly gave the book an A, stating that \"No brief review can begin to do justice either to Truman or to the monumentally persuasive job McCullough has done re-creating his life and times.... Immeasurably aided by Truman's vividly written diaries and letters to his beloved wife, Bess, McCullough brings the man and his times to life with painstaking clarity.\"\nThe book won McCullough his first Pulitzer Prize, in the category of \"Best Biography or Autobiography\".\n\n\n== Adaptation ==\nIn 1995, the book was adapted into Truman, a television film by HBO, starring Gary Sinise as Truman.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTruman on GoogleBooks\nEugene Register article on Truman\nAssociated Press article on Truman\nNew York Times review of Truman\nTime review of Truman\nReading Eagle article on Truman\nBooknotes interview with McCullough on Truman, July 19, 1992, C-SPAN\nPresentation by McCullough on Truman at the National Press Club, July 7, 1992, C-SPAN",

In 2012, a Steven Spielberg film based on the book was released to critical acclaim.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTeam of Rivals is the sixth book by American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. In 1995, Goodwin was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History for her book No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II, a similar study of personalities in the Roosevelt White House.\nGoodwin spent ten years on the research and writing of Team of Rivals. She stated that she had been inspired to tell the stories of the four men (Seward, Chase, Bates, and Lincoln) together when realizing that the cabinet members had written extensive diaries and letters that might provide a \"new angle\" in Lincoln studies.\nDuring Goodwin's work on Team of Rivals, a plagiarism scandal erupted over unmarked quotations in Goodwin's 1987 book The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys. Goodwin stated that in dealing with the scandal, during which she had to apologize and make an out-of-court settlement to author Lynne McTaggart, she found Lincoln a consolation, particularly his philosophy \"not to waste precious energies on recriminations about the past\". In a 2012 interview, Goodwin cited early 20th-century muckraker Ida Tarbell on the pleasures of writing about Lincoln: \"Somebody asked her, why do so many people write about Lincoln? And she said, because he's so companionable. And I think somehow that's been true for me.\"\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe book begins with an introduction where Goodwin explains how she plans to illuminate Lincoln's life: \"In my own effort to illuminate the character and career of Abraham Lincoln, I have coupled the account of his life with the stories of the remarkable men who were his rivals for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination—New York senator William H. Seward, Ohio governor Salmon P. Chase, and Missouri's distinguished elder statesman Edward Bates.\" The book is organized in two parts: Part 1 called \"The Rivals\"  and Part 2 called \"Master Among Men\".  The first part of the book chronicles the rise of Lincoln and each of his political rivals' journeys and how Lincoln ended up with the presidency and ends with the inauguration of Lincoln in 1861. In the second part, Goodwin describes Lincoln's years as President of the Union through the civil war and until his eventual assassination in 1865.\nThe first chapter of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination on May 18, 1860, awaiting the results of the national convention by telegraph: New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward, widely considered the frontrunner; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, a favorite of the party's more radical wing; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates, preferred by more conservative elements of the party; and Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois. Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence: Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed, Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery, Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention, and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election.\nAt the Chicago Republican Convention of 1860, Seward was the favorite, as he was the most widely recognized political figure and almost had a majority of pledges. Seward's detractors, who thought that he was too radical on slavery and too liberal on immigration, were worried that if the opposition could not be united behind one man, he would be elected as the candidate - \"Murat Halstead of the Cincinnati Commercial telegraphed the same message to his paper at the same time, reporting that \"every one of the forty thousand men in attendance upon the Chicago Convention will testify that at midnight of Thursday–Friday night, the universal impression was that Seward's success was certain.\" However, it was a concern that even if Seward was elected as candidate, he would not be able to carry all the Northern states in the elections because of his abolitionist views against slavery and that would mean a Democratic win in the election.\nSimilarly, Edward Bates could not represent the middle-line of the Republican Party: \"He was much too conservative for liberal Republicans, who might welcome him into their party but would never accord him chief command of an army in which he had never officially enlisted. At the same time, the letter he had written to prove his credentials to the Republicans had diminished the previous enthusiasm of conservatives and former Know Nothings\". Salmon Chase's candidacy was hampered by attacks from Ohio politicians like Judge McLean or Benjamin Wade and could not mount a serious challenge. Lincoln emerged as the more palatable choice for these important delegates. Lincoln was ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by making himself the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions, and proceeded to win the presidency.\n\nDetermined both to hold the party together and to recruit the ablest men for his cabinet, Lincoln then persuaded each of his former rivals to join his cabinet. Seward assumed the post of Secretary of State, Chase that of Secretary of the Treasury, and Bates that of United States Attorney General. The South seceded following Lincoln's election, and the country fell into the American Civil War. Goodwin describes in detail some cabinet decisions, such as the debate over provisioning Fort Sumter in South Carolina, the first state that had seceded (in December 1860), and the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the slaves of secession states. She also traces the home life of the book's main figures, including the marriage of Chase's daughter and close companion Kate, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln's role in Washington, D.C. society, and the death of Lincoln's son Willie.\nDuring the war, Seward comes to respect and collaborate with Lincoln. Chase, on the other hand, schemes against Lincoln from within the cabinet, hoping to replace him as the Republican nominee in the 1864 presidential election. Lincoln nonetheless keeps Chase in the cabinet until 1864 for his skill at financing the war effort, and his efforts to undermine the president are ultimately unsuccessful. Lincoln also recruits Chase ally Edwin M. Stanton to replace Pennsylvania political boss Simon Cameron as Secretary of War; like Seward, Stanton comes to respect and support Lincoln. While managing the disparate personalities of his cabinet, Lincoln also struggles to manage a series of generals including George B. McClellan, Henry Halleck, and George Meade. The president finally finds success in 1864 by promoting Ulysses S. Grant to commander of the Union armies.\nLincoln oversees the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolishes slavery, and sees the war to its successful conclusion. During the battle for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, Lincoln uses all kinds of persuasion and incentives to get the required number of votes for ratification: \"I am President of the United States, clothed with great power. The abolition of slavery by constitutional provision settles the fate, for all coming time, not only of the millions now in bondage, but of unborn millions to come—a measure of such importance that those two votes must be procured. I leave it to you to determine how it shall be done; but remember that I am President of the United States, clothed with immense power, and I expect you to procure those votes.\" He also appoints Chase as the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, believing him the best man to secure the rights of newly freed black citizens.\nTeam of Rivals closes with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. Seward is also attacked by a knife-wielding assailant, though he survives. An epilogue traces the later lives and deaths of Seward, Stanton, Bates, Chase, Mary Lincoln, and others.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPulitzer Prize-winning Civil War historian James M. McPherson called it \"an elegant, incisive study of Lincoln and leading members of his cabinet that will appeal to experts as well as to those whose knowledge of Lincoln is an amalgam of high school history and popular mythology\" and stated that Goodwin addressed Lincoln's gift for coalition-building \"better than any other writer\". Allen C. Guelzo wrote in The Washington Post that \"this immense, finely boned book is no dull administrative or bureaucratic history; rather, it is a story of personalities – a messianic drama, if you will – in which Lincoln must increase and the others must decrease.\" In the Seattle Times, Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett praised the book's \"ambitious, multi-strand structure\", concluding, \"This monumental effort is a gift; Goodwin's work clarifies and preserves Lincoln's legacy with rare skill.\" Randy Dotinga of the Christian Science Monitor called Team of Rivals an \"immense and immensely readable work\". Sanford D. Horwitt of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Goodwin is \"an engaging, insightful chronicler of Lincoln's Civil War presidency, although she strays from time to time from her stated intention of keeping the lens focused on Lincoln and his 1860 rivals, who, in turn, were often feuding with others in Lincoln's Cabinet.\"\nIn 2006, the book was awarded the Lincoln Prize, \"awarded annually for the finest scholarly work in English on Abraham Lincoln, the American Civil War soldier, or a subject relating to their era\". On March 29, 2006, Goodwin was announced as the winner of the $50,000 Book Prize for American History of the New-York Historical Society. Team of Rivals was also a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize.\nU.S. President Barack Obama named Team of Rivals as the one book he would want on a desert island. As a senator, he met with Goodwin in Washington to discuss the book. After his election in 2008, Obama reached out to previous rivals including Hillary Clinton, who became his Secretary of State, drawing comparisons to Lincoln's \"Team of Rivals\" approach.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nWhile consulting on a project for director Steven Spielberg in 1999, Goodwin  told Spielberg she was planning to write Team of Rivals, and Spielberg immediately told her he wanted the film rights. DreamWorks finalized the deal in 2001, and Goodwin sent Spielberg the book chapter by chapter as she composed it. Daniel Day-Lewis agreed to play Abraham Lincoln after Liam Neeson, the original lead, withdrew from the project in 2010. The screenplay was written by Tony Kushner, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay). A number of critics noted that the final film, which focused almost entirely on the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment through Congress, was based on only a few pages of Goodwin's book, and that Kushner did substantial independent research composing the screenplay.\nFilming began on October 17, 2011, and ended on December 19, 2011. Goodwin consulted with Kushner on various drafts of the screenplay and took Day-Lewis on a tour of Lincoln's home and law office in Springfield, Illinois. The film was released nationwide on November 16, 2012, to commercial success and wide critical acclaim. Day-Lewis won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nGoodwin, Doris Kearns (2005).

This event marked the last time they were peacefully with each other. These figures then went on to become central to World War I. This includes Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. \nThe remaining twenty one chapters of the book are grouped in three parts: \"Plans\", \"Outbreak\" and \"Battle\". \n\"Plans\" delves into the prewar military strategies of the four major European powers:\n\nGermany – Facing threats from the West and the East since the 1890s, the Schlieffen Plan was designed to avoid fighting a prolonged war at two fronts at once by quickly beating France, as done in 1870 (and again in 1940), before the Russian Empire could mobilise its forces. It relied on attacking France through Belgium with a strong right wing, but Schlieffen's successor as the chief of German General Staff, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, weakened the plan, leading to assumptions of a swift victory that were overly optimistic (chapter 2).\nFrance – After decades of defensive strategies following their quick defeat at Sedan, France adopted General Joseph Joffre's offensive Plan XVII in 1913, emphasizing attack and broad operational plans (chapter 3).\nBritain – The military cooperation with France evolved from informal arrangements to a formal naval agreement and  Britain preparing to deploy the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but these initiatives were supported by a narrow and fragile political will (chapter 4).\nRussia – Despite internal weaknesses and corruption, Russia's massive army planned an invasion of Eastern Prussia, prompting Germany to prepare reactive strategies to protect this critical territory (chapter 5).\n\"Outbreak\" meticulously chronicles the events that led Europe into war, hour by hour, between August 1 and 4, 1914:\n\nOn August 1, Germany ordered general mobilization; its offensive might have taken a radically different direction if Wilhelm II, on the basis of a misunderstood telegram from London, had managed to convince Moltke to change plans; but Moltke prevailed and Luxembourg was invaded (chapter 6).\nFrance declared general mobilization on the same day in response to Germany's ultimatum to Russia while in London Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's divided Cabinet failed to move (chapter 7).\nOn August 2, 1914, Germany presented Belgium with an ultimatum, which King Albert rejected (chapter 8).\nOn August 3 and 4, political leaders in Germany, France, Belgium, and Britain unified their nations behind the war imperative; Germany declared war on France and invaded Belgium, which triggered Britain's entry into the war, with only a few leaders foreseeing a prolonged conflict (chapter 9).\n\"Battle\" extensively details three of the four European military fronts of August 1914:\n\nthe Western Front: the Battle of the Frontiers (chapters 11 to 14), the battle of ideas (chapter 17), and the fighting in France up to the beginning of the First Battle of the Marne (chapters 19 to 22)\nthe Eastern Prussia Front (chapters 15 and 16);\nthe sea front: the Adriatic Campaign (chapter 10) and more generally the strategies of the three main naval forces, the UK, Germany and the US (chapter 18).\nThe afterword reflects on the First Battle of the Marne, highlighting the deadlock and immense human and material costs of the Western Front. Despite the Allies' eventual success in saving Paris, the war's initial battles failed to be decisive and resulted in a war of attrition. The next four years of war were mostly determined by the events that took place in August 1914.\n\n\n== Summary by chapters ==\n\n\n=== Ch. 1 – A Funeral ===\nOn May 20, 1910, of the nine kings who led the funeral of King Edward VII, Kaiser Wilhelm II held conflicted views on his deceased uncle. In public, he was the gravest and most attentionate mourner. In private, he scorned Edward's personal diplomacy which supported Britain's shift from isolation to alliances with former foes France and Russia, calling his uncle \"Satan\" for plotting to encircle Germany. Wilhelm's inner tension reflected a wider polarisation around the question of Germany's rise, illustrated by two influential books. In \"The Great Illusion\" Norman Angell demonstrated that any war between large states was impossible because of its exorbitant cost whereas General von Bernhardi argued in \"Germany and the Next War\" that his nation had to either attack and annihilate France, or accept its downfall. On that May morning of 1910 \"the sun of the old world was setting in a dying blaze of splendor never to be seen again.\"\n\n\n=== Plans ===\n\n\n==== Ch. 2 – \"Let the Last Man on the Right Brush the Channel with His Sleeve\" ====\nTo avert a two-front war, Schlieffen saw it as a \"military necessity\" to attack France via Belgium, whose perpetual neutrality was guaranteed internationally since 1839. If Germany threw seven-eighths of its 1.5 million soldiers against France, it could beat it in six weeks before turning to Russia. Influenced by Clausewitz and the recent decisive victories over Austria and France, Schlieffen's plan aimed to march 34 active and 20 reserve divisions through Belgium. Such a strong right wing would envelop the French armies and rake in the BEF. Schlieffen presumed Belgium would merely protest but the Kaiser, who wanted more assurance, unsuccessfully attempted to bribe King Leopold II by promising him French territories and money. Moltke, who succeeded Schlieffen in 1906, weakened the right wing at each new iteration of the war plan. His version of June 1914 saw Paris capitulate 39 days after mobilisation but assumed delusively that every possible contingency could be planned for.\n\n\n==== Ch. 3 – The Shadow of Sedan ====\nThe humiliating defeat at Sedan set France on the defensive for forty years. Sixteen war plans were produced, each defensive. But her direction changed a few years to 1914 after it gradually regained confidence in itself as a nation and General Foch planted the seed of the mystique of the will in the military doctrine. The War Council, pressed by the War Minister Messimy, replaced in 1911 the defensive General Michel with General Joffre, who developed Plan XVII, the first offensive war plan adopted by the War Council in May 1913 and ready for distribution to generals in February 1914. Its bold goal – go to Berlin via Mainz – was not supported by a detailed operational war plan like Schlieffen's but instead emphasised the army's imperative – Attack! – and laid out war options that generals could implement depending on circumstances.\n\n\n==== Ch. 4 – \"A Single British Soldier …\" ====\nRussia's defeat to Japan in 1905 precipitated Germany in probing France in Morocco and Britain in developing military arrangements with France after Campbell-Bannerman authorised Wilson to open informal works with his French counterpart. But this embryonic military cooperation waned after the first Moroccan crisis subsided. It re-emerged in 1910 when Wilson used his new position of Director of Military Operations and his friendship with Foch to reinvigorate joint war plans, just in time for the second Moroccan crisis of 1911, whose aftermath was a shake up of the Royal Navy's top brass, a naval agreement between Britain and France and a non-binding mutual support of their armies. Wilson delivered \"Plan W\" by the spring of 1914. Britain's military was ready to deploy the BEF and 145,000 men to France but the British political leaders were not: only the few involved in the CID were aware of these military commitments.\n\n\n==== Ch. 5 – The Russian steamroller ====\nNot withstanding its defeats (Crimea in 1856, Manchuria in 1905) and defects, Russia's imposing 6.5 million men army unsettled Germany and reassured France and Britain, its Triple Entente allies. After the defeat to Japan, Grand Duke Nicholas, as chair of the Council of National Defence, initiated military reforms but these were thwarted in 1908 when the conservatives dissolved it. The same year, Sukhomlinov became Minister of War. Corrupt and inefficient, he froze the modernisation of the army and changed Chief of Staff six times by 1914. Still, despite these weaknesses, Russia planned to invade Eastern Prussia with two armies totalling 800,000 men. But Germany was determined to retain this vital territory. Max Hoffmann, anticipating that the Russian army would have to split around the Masurian lakes, considered two reactive tactics: a retreat or a frontal assault on either flank.\n\n\n=== Outbreak ===\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand's assassination on June 28, 1914, led Austria to seek Serbia's annexation, with German backing on July 5. Austria's ultimatum on July 23, followed by a declaration of war on July 28 and Belgrade's bombardment on July 29, provoked Russia to mobilize on July 30 to defend Slav interests and its prestige. Germany's ultimatum to Russia on July 31 intensified the crisis. \"War pressed against every frontier.\"\n\n\n==== Ch. 6 – August 1: Berlin ====\nKaiser Wilhelm decreed general mobilization at 5 PM on August 1, initiating the invasion of Luxembourg at 7 PM. However, an opportunity to change this course and the twentieth century emerged shortly after 5 PM when Foreign Minister Jagow and Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg unexpectedly received a telegram from Ambassador Lichnowsky stating that Britain would remain neutral if Germany did not attack France. The Kaiser immediately sought to alter the war plan: \"Now we can go to war against Russia only. We simply march the whole of our Army to the East!\" But an apoplectic Moltke rebuked him: \"Your Majesty, [the war plan] cannot be altered.\" Despite General von Staabs arguing in 1925 that technically four of the seven armies could have been deployed to the Eastern Front by August 15, temperamentally it is difficult to believe Germany would not have attacked France when Der Tag arrived. Lichnowsky's second telegram at 11 PM made this point moot: it clarified that Britain's neutrality required Germany to refrain from attacking both France and Russia. Admiral von Tirpitz pragmatically questioned the wisdom of serving an ultimatum to Russia if Germany did not intend to attack it, but diplomatic protocol and military schedules prevailed: the German die was cast.\n\n\n==== Ch. 7 – August 1: Paris and London ====\nOn July 30, the French Cabinet, led by Premier Viviani, made the unprecedented decision \"never before taken in history\" to withdraw troops ten kilometers from its borders to avoid clashes with the German Army. Germany and Russia immediately sought France's stance in a potential conflict. On the evening of July 31, German Ambassador von Schoen posed the question through diplomatic channels, while Russian Ambassador Isvolsky pressed President Poincaré at 2 AM in his bedroom. Viviani responded to Schoen at 11 AM on August 1, stating, \"France will act in accordance with her interests.\" Minutes later, Isvolsky informed the French of Germany's ultimatum to Russia. The Cabinet convened and decreed the general mobilization that Joffre had been advocating for since July 29. By 4 PM, the first mobilization posters appeared at Place de la Concorde, with mobilization starting at midnight.\nThe British Cabinet was divided over whether to support France in case of war. The four Liberal Imperialists, Asquith, Grey, Haldane, and Churchill, believed Britain's national interest lay in supporting France, while the Little Englanders led by Morley, were suspicious of any foreign adventures. Asquith patiently balanced the mounting tensions. At the July 31 Cabinet meeting, Grey threatened to resign if Britain chose neutrality over supporting France. The next day, Lloyd George described Germany's potential attack on France as requiring only a \"little violation\" of Belgian territory. Four Little Englanders – Morley, Burns, Simon, and Harcourt – proposed to resign if Britain implemented the naval agreement with France, and the Cabinet did not authorize Grey and Churchill's actions. Nevertheless, Churchill, who \"smelled battle afar off [like] the war horse in Job\" had already ordered the British fleet to its war stations at Scapa Flow on July 28 and persuaded Asquith on July 29 to authorize the Warning Telegram, initiating the Precautionary Period. After the Cabinet denied him further authority, Churchill mobilized the fleet upon learning that Germany had declared war on Russia. Grey, sensing that the Little Englanders might only be persuaded if Belgian neutrality was violated, asked France and Germany on July 31 if they would respect Belgian neutrality. France responded positively within an hour, but Germany remained silent.\n\n\n==== Ch. 8 – Ultimatum in Brussels ====\nOn the morning of August 2, 1914, German Minister Claus von Below-Saleske assured Foreign Minister Davignon that Belgium had nothing to fear from Germany, despite the invasion of Luxembourg. That evening, Below was asked to open the sealed envelope he had received from Berlin on July 29: it contained Germany's ultimatum. Dumbfounded, he presented it to Davignon at 7 PM, expecting a reply by 7 AM the next morning. This carefully crafted document asserted that France was about to enter Belgium to attack Germany, which in reaction would \"anticipate this attack\" to assert its self-defense rights and have to pass through Belgium. Were Belgium to resist, it would be treated as an enemy.\nKing Albert was less surprised than Below. In November 1913, Kaiser Wilhelm and General Moltke had conveyed to him their readiness to wage war against France, citing constant provocations. Despite the poor state of its army, which consisted of only six infantry and one cavalry division, no heavy artillery, no clear war strategy, and four different mobilization plans, Albert remained resolute: \"Our answer must be 'No' whatever the consequences.\"\nAs the Belgian officials were busy drafting their reply, the German government had second thoughts. Fearing that Belgian resistance would disrupt the critical operational schedule towards Paris, it instructed Below to persuade the Belgians to comply. At 1:30 AM on August 3, during a surprise visit to the Foreign Office, he used the fake news of French dirigibles bombing Nuremberg to imply that France would next invade Belgium. Unconvinced by this last-minute logic, Belgium formally rejected the German demand on August 3 at 7 AM, being \"firmly resolved to repel every attack upon its rights.\" That evening, angered by the Kaiser's dismissive reply to the last-minute appeal he had sent on August 1, Albert ordered the destruction of bridges and tunnels to impede any German advance.\n\n\n==== Ch. 9 – \"Home before the leaves fall\" ====\nAugust 3 and 4 were key action days: the German, French, Belgian and British political leaders crystallized into national unions the tensions that had been building up for months, and the German General Staff declared war on France and invaded Belgium.\nOn the political front: At 3 PM on August 3, Grey revealed to the House of Commons the existence of informal military talks with France and asked it not to stand by and witness the violation of Belgian neutrality and the \"unmeasured aggrandizement of any power whatsoever.\" The House responded with overwhelming applause.\nOn August 4 at 9 AM, an hour after Belgium was invaded, King Albert’s question to the parliament, “Are you unalterably decided to maintain intact the sacred gift of our forefathers?\" was met with resounding shouts of \"Oui! Oui! Oui!” A few hours later, Viviani’s eloquent speech to the joint session of the French Senate and Chamber was greeted with cheers, especially after announcing Italy's choice to stay neutral. Simultaneously in Berlin, the Kaiser famously declared in his speech from the throne: “From this day on, I recognize no parties but only Germans.” At 3 PM, Bethmann-Hollweg informed the Reichstag that German troops were “perhaps already in Belgium\" and admitted publicly that this “invasion [was] contrary to international law”, after which it unanimously voted for a 5 billion mark war credit and adjourned for four months.\nOn the military front: On August 3 at 6:30 PM, Ambassador Schoen delivered to Viviani the German declaration of war on France on the ground of organized hostility, alleged French aviators bombarding Nuremberg and flying over neutral Belgium, all of which Viviani categorically denied.\nOn August 4, Germany invaded Belgium at Gemmerich at 8:02 AM after its ultimatum was rejected. Moltke, who had anticipated in 1912 that invading Belgium would trigger Britain’s entry into the war, was not surprised, contrary to the Kaiser and Beltmann-Hollweg, when Grey sent Britain’s ultimatum to Germany and demanded a reply by midnight.\nThe prevalent opinion in all belligerent countries was well captured by the Kaiser’s words to his departing troops: “You will be home before the leaves have fallen from the trees.\" Only Joffre, Moltke, and Kitchener foresaw a prolonged conflict, with Kitchener predicting the war would take “[at least] three years, [...such a long time that] no one living knows how long.\"\n\n\n=== Battle ===\n\n\n==== Ch. 10 – \"Goeben ... An Enemy Then Flying\" ====\nTuchman starts the \"Battle\" section by covering the search by Allied naval forces for the German battlecruiser Goeben in the Mediterranean (chapter 10). The Goeben finally took refuge in the Dardanelles, waters of the then neutral Ottoman Empire. Such naval actions set off diplomatic maneuvers, but the event precipitated Turkey's entry into the war on the side of Germany. The development worked to block Russian import/export via its year-round ports on the Black Sea. That, in turn, led to the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign.\n\n\n==== Ch. 11 – Liège and Alsace ====\nAs they crossed the Belgian frontier, the German armies were engaged by the Belgian army in front of Liège, five French armies in the east of France and four British divisions (known as the British Expeditionary Force) in the south of Belgium. The French were said to be labouring under the delusion that Gallic élan would be crucial in countering German attacks while the British fought hard at the Battle of Mons. In August, each side deployed its armed forces in order to effect its own strategies developed in advance of the war (discussed in \"Plans\").\n\n\n==== Ch. 12 – BEF to the Continent ====\nThe War Council met on August 5 to approve the General Staff's war plans but Lord Kitchener, a highly respected figure – \"For England to have gone to war without Kitchener would have been as unthinkable as Sunday without church\" –  disrupted the proceedings. He predicted the war would last at least three years and require the army to grow from twenty-four to seventy divisions. Fearing that a joint commandment with the French would imperil the nucleus of the regular army around which he planned to build this stronger army, he expressed \"profound contempt\" for the war plan. Despite his objections, the Council agreed to send six BEF divisions to a French port, with the final location to be decided later.\nThat evening a leak from the Westminster Gazette about the BEF's size sparked uproar. The next day, the Council, meeting with French Colonel Huguet, reduced the BEF to four divisions and cavalry. Tensions flared when Kitchener reprimanded Wilson for revealing to Huguet BEF’s embarkation times, which he deemed a secret. Wilson’s sharp response – he viewed Kitchener  \"as much an enemy of England as Molke\" – left a lasting strain on their cooperation which would not help the BEF.\nOn August 12, at the last War Council before engagement, Kitchener made a last attempt to shift the BEF’s concentration point seventy miles back from Maubeuge to Amiens, fearing a German envelopment. Despite his authority, even he could not alter the predetermined plan as there was no time for alternatives. After intense debate, he reluctantly conceded but issued John French conflicting orders: the BEF was to support France but avoid undue risk and remain entirely independent of Allied command. This lack of unity \"was to haunt the Allied war effort long after Sir John was replaced and Kitchener himself was dead.\"\nThe 80,000 soldiers of the BEF embarked on August 9 and were greeted with a rapturous welcome by French crowds all their way to Mons.\n\n\n==== Ch. 13 – Sambre et Meuse ====\nAlthough delayed by Belgian resistance, the German armies advance through Belgium and prepare their right wing for the outflanking manoeuvre. The French get ready for their main offensive in the Ardennes. The BEF advances towards the left flank of the French armies. The Germans enter Brussels on August 20th.\n\n\n==== Ch. 14 – Debacle: Lorraine, Ardennes, Charleroi, Mons ====\nThe French High Command had made incomplete allowances for dealing with the large massed attack by the German army, which now came quickly bearing down on them. It was perhaps through the decisions of Charles Lanrezac, the French Fifth Army commander, who acted in a timely fashion before getting permission from Joseph Joffre, that the entire French line was eventually saved from envelopment and general collapse. Although his pleas were ignored, Lanrezac withdrew his forces at Charleroi from an untenable position and probable destruction, and he redeployed them more favorably. He was later relieved of command.\n\n\n==== Ch. 15 – \"The Cossacks Are Coming\" ====\nThe invasion of East Prussia began on August 12, when General Gurko, part of Rennenkampf's First Army, took the town of Marggrabowa. On August 17, Rennenkampf's 200,000-strong army crossed the border from the north, advancing along a 35-mile front toward the Insterburg Gap and pushing ahead of them a wave of panicked Germans, crying \"The Cossacks are coming!\" Meanwhile, Samsonov's Second Army was advancing from the south, intending to complete a pincer movement. However, poor coordination between the two Russian armies, unencrypted communications, and severe ammunition shortages undermined the plan.\n\nVon Prittwitz’s Eighth Army had its own problems, the most prominent of which was its lack of leadership. On August 20, General von François, disobeying Prittwitz’s orders, charged ahead and defeated the Russian 28th Division at Gumbinnen. But when Mackensen's 35th Division was routed, Prittwitz insisted on retreating the army behind the Vistula. This reaction to the defeat led Moltke to dismiss at once Chief of Staff Waldersee and Prittwitz on August 21 and replace the former with Ludendorff on the same day, who immediately ordered François to move south to support General Scholtz’s XX Corps, and the latter with Hindenburg on August 23. Hindenburrg and Ludendorff met Scholtz at Tannenberg on August 24 and learned from intercepted communications that Samsonov’s army would launch a major attack the next day. Ignoring Rennenkampf’s northern forces, Hindenburg and Ludendorff concentrated their entire army on defeating Samsonov, setting the stage for the decisive Battle of Tannenberg.\n\n\n==== Ch. 16 – Tannenberg ====\nChapter 16 presents Germany's reaction to the invasion which culminates at the Battle of Tannenberg, where the Russian advance is stopped, decisively. Tuchman covers the series of errors, faulty plans, poor communications, and poor logistics, which, among other things, decidedly helped the French in the west. For example, the Germans mistakenly transferred, from the west, two corps to defend against what the book refers to as the 'Russian Steam Roller'. The great misery that developed on the Eastern Front is noted.\n\n\n==== Ch. 17 – The Flames of Louvain ====\nWoven into the text about the battles in Belgium are threads of fact that Allied governments would employ in the formation of the West's eventual opinion that Germany had been the aggressor nation against Belgium. Such facts and conclusions would be repeated for the duration of the war and greatly affect the future involvement of the United States.\nAlso here in chapter 17 The Flames of Louvain, Tuchman places a selection of German views from a variety of sources as to the aims and desires of Germany. She cites Thomas Mann as saying the goal was \"the establishment of the German idea in history, the enthronement of Kultur, the fulfillment of Germany's historical mission\". She then conveys American reporter Irvin S. Cobb's account of an interview with a 'German scientist': \"Germany [is] for progress. German Kultur will enlighten the world and after this war there will never be another.\" Yet further, a 'German businessman' opines that the war will give Europe \"a new map, and Germany will be at the center of it\" (aims similar to the Septemberprogramm). Such outspoken menace worked to solidify opposition to Germany, caused George Bernard Shaw to become \"fed up\" at Prussian Militarism, and H. G. Wells to condemn the German \"war god\" and hope for an end to all armed conflict.\nChapter 17's main focus is the German army's atrocities in Belgium, in particular against the historic university city of Louvain. Tuchman frames her remarks by describing the Schrecklichkeit, the German military's \"theory of terror\". Accordingly, in a failed attempt to suppress the \"illegal\" franc-tireur (civilians shooting at German troops), hundreds of nearby citizens at several Belgium towns had been executed. Her accounts of the ferocity of such German army reprisals against the general population and of the willful burning of Louvain, such as its university library make it obvious why the Western Allies might feel themselves justified to condemn Germany and Germans wholesale.\n\n\n==== Ch. 18 – Blue Water, Blockade and the Great Neutral ====\n\nChapter 18 describes the British fear that since their island nation was dependent on overseas imports, the German navy could manage to disrupt their international trade. Although Britain's navy was superior in ships and experience, perhaps the German navy's \"best opportunity for a successful battle was in the first two or three weeks of the war.\" However, the German High Seas Fleet remained in port and was ordered not to challenge the British warships watching the North Sea. Thus, a substantial control over the world's seaways was then exerted by the British Royal Navy.\nSurrounding the neutral role of the United States, diplomatic politicking quickly intensified. On August 6, Washington formally requested the Europeans to agree to follow the 1908 Declaration of London, which \"favored the neutrals' right to trade as against the belligerents' right to blockade.\" Germany agreed. Britain \"said Yes and meant No\" and supplemented an Order of Council on August 20 (the 100th anniversary of Britain's burning of Washington). Despite the equitable intent of international law, Britain sought to receive supplies from America while its naval blockade of Germany denied the supplies to Germany. Woodrow Wilson had already advised Americans on August 18 to be \"neutral in fact as well as in name, impartial in thought as well as in action\" so that America might become the \"impartial mediator\" that could then bring \"standards of righteousness and humanity\" to the belligerents in order to negotiate \"a peace without victory\" in Europe. Both wartime paper profits from a nearly fourfold increase in trade with Britain and France and \"German folly\" eventually would later work to cause American entry into World War I.\n\n\n==== Ch. 19 – Retreat ====\nOn August 25, Joffre issued a General Order to form a Sixth Army, which was transported to Amiens to support the British and the French Fourth and Fifth Armies. On August 26, at the Battle of Le Cateau, the 75,000 strong BEF led by Smith-Dorrien lost over 8,000 men but managed to delay the Germans. The French Fifth Army, under Lanrezac, struggled to retreat, regroup, and establish a defensive line; coordination issues and miscommunications with Field Marshall French added to the chaos and confusion. By August 28, German commanders, particularly von Kluck, shifted their focus from cutting off the British to enveloping both the British and French forces, significantly impacting the German campaign's progress. By September 2, the French armies had fallen back 150 miles from their starting positions on August 24; soldiers retreated haggard, hungry, and exhausted, marching past their own homes which they knew Germans would occupy the next day.\n\n\n==== Ch. 20 – The front is Paris ====\nAugust 29 and 30 proved to be turning points for the French Army. On the 29th, Lanrezac repelled a German attack at the bridge of Guise. However, Joffre, unaware of this success, could only see his Fifth and Sixth Armies in precarious positions and the BEF retreating. During this “most tragic [period] in all of French history” Joffre ordered, in \"wonderful calm\", generals d’Amade and Lanrezac to pull back and blow up the bridges over the Somme and the Oise. Next day brought worse news: Russia’s Second Army had just been defeated at Tannenberg and 70,000 soldiers taken prisoner. Yet, another intelligence report gave him reason to hope: Moltke had decided to transfer two German corps (70,000 soldiers) from West to East.\nBritain also turned a corner at home and on the battlefront. On August 30, the censor F. E. Smith urged The Times to publish Arthur Moore’s Amiens dispatch which detailed Germany’s advances. This powerful recruitment propaganda landed on a public opinion that had been shaped since August 27 by a rumor that 70,000 Russian troops had been transported across Britain to aid French forces. These soldiers were, in fact, “phantom,” but the British public’s hallucination was so strong that it contaminated France, where droves of Parisians gathered at railway stations to welcome these imaginary Cossacks, and Germany, where it influenced the military command at the Marne as much as the actual troop movements. On the military front, Sir John French informed Lord Kitchener on August 29 that he planned to withdraw the BEF behind the Seine due to his waning confidence in the French troops, which were \"fall[ing] back right and left of [him …], a militant misstatement of the truth, after Joffre had just finished telling him the opposite.\" Lord Kitchener was so shocked by the mere idea that the BEF could retreat, a \"calamitous\" act and \"a violation of the spirit of the Entente\" that he confronted French at the British Embassy in Paris on September 1 and persuaded him to keep his troops engaged with the French forces. Britain was turning its corner.\nAs for the German Army, it was now within 30 miles of Paris, so tantalizingly close that it was about to distribute to its soldiers a bronze medal inscribed \"Entry of German Troops in Paris – 1871–1914.\"\n\n\n==== Ch. 21 – Von Kluck's Turn ====\nAfter defeating Maunoury, Kluck sought to change his strategy, aiming southeast to outflank Lanrezac and close the gap with Bülow. He needed reinforcements, but Moltke, paralyzed by indecision, was focused on three issues: i) failing to capture Paris as scheduled, ii) rumors of 80,000 Russian reinforcements, and iii) widening gaps between his armies, which could only be closed by abandoning the conquest of Nancy and Toul.\nDespite Moltke’s hesitation, Kluck acted. Recognizing that Maunoury was defeated, the BEF was absent, and his flank was secure, Kluck decided on August 31 to turn southeast at Bülow's suggestion to cut off the French Vth Army's retreat. Moltke approved the change, eager to resolve the gaps between his forces and maintain the Paris timeline.\nHowever, Kluck’s aggressive nature would lead to his undoing. On September 1, he unexpectedly encountered the BEF at Compiègne and Villers-Cotterêts, but instead of letting them retreat, he pursued them and lost two days. Additionally, he ignored Moltke’s orders to follow the Second Army in echelon, opting to press ahead toward the Marne aiming to drive the French southeastward.\nIt took the French two days to act on the realization Kluck had turned away from Paris. On August 31, Captain Lepic was surprised to notice two German columns heading toward Compiègne, not Paris. The following day Captain Fagalde found a map on a dead German cavalryman confirming the shift. Acting on this intelligence, Joffre issued General Order No. 4 on September 2, directing the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Armies to retreat toward the Seine and Aube. Once the Fifth Army had evaded encirclement and received reinforcements from eastern France and the mobile units of Paris, they would go on the offensive. Gallieni, now commanding the Sixth Army, ordered Maunoury to destroy the bridges on the Oise and advised the government to evacuate Paris for Bordeaux, which they did on the night of Sedan Day, shocking the public. On September 3, two aviators of Gallieni’s army spotted German columns moving eastward, prompting General Clergerie and Colonel Giraudon to shout: “They offer us their flank!”\n\n\n==== Ch. 22 – \"Gentlemen, We Will Fight on the Marne\" ====\nDue to communications issues between Kluck’s army and Luxembourg, OHL realized only on September 4 that Kluck had crossed the Marne, thus disobeying their orders of September 2. Kluck’s push reflected the confidence of German officers in their imminent entry into Paris, except for Moltke, who, puzzled by the absence of the usual signs of victory, believed the French were not defeated but retreating to prepare a counteroffensive. Recognizing the vulnerability of Kluck's left flank, which was advancing southeast with an exhausted army and delayed supplies, Moltke considered at last pulling reinforcements from his left wing. He proposed the move to Rupprecht but the Kaiser balked at the idea of weakening the army that could take Nancy. Moltke backed down and ended the day signing the order that would halt Germany's right wing.\nMeanwhile, the French Army was turning a corner. Although it continued retreating, Joffre was preparing for the day after. On September 3, he relieved Lanrezac, whom he found depressed, ineffective in collaborating with John French, and prone to criticizing his orders and appointed Franchet d'Esperey to command the 5th Army. On September 4, following a day of solitary reflection, Joffre decided at 6 PM that France would attack on September 7 with the armed forces of Franchet d’Esperey, Foch, Gallieni and French. However these last two upset his plan. Gallieni had already sent preliminary orders to Maunoury to prepare to march on September 4 and thus forced Joffre’s hand to advance the attack to September 6 as he was afraid Maunoury’s move would disclose the whole offensive to the Germans. Joffre was also assuming the BEF would join the offensive but was stunned to learn, after he had issued his order at 8:30 P.M., that John French had decided to wait and see.\nKluck continued disregarding Moltke’s order to retreat and crossed the Grand Morin on September 5. He yielded only after Moltke presented him with evidence that the French were preparing to attack his flank. By then, it was too late. On the Allied side, Joffre motored three hours to the BEF's HQ at Melun, where he urged John French to join the counter-offensive. With tears in his eyes, French agreed to \"do all we possibly can.\" Back at GQG, Joffre ended the day declaring to his assembled officers: \"Gentlemen, we will fight on the Marne.\"\n\n\n=== Afterword ===\nAfter Maunoury provoked Kluck’s turnabout, a gap opened in the German lines which the Allies failed to exploit as the BEF moved in too slowly and the German Army retreated in time to avoid a piercing. Germany’s much sought after decisive victory was eluding her. Moltke and von Kluck attributed this failure to the unexpected power of the French élan and this “extraordinary and peculiar aptitude of the French soldier to recover quickly, [...] a possibility not studied in our war academy.\" Beside the morale of the French soldier, six strategic and tactical errors contributed to Germany stalling:\n\ntwo corps were taken out of the Western front and sent East\nfor too long, the German Armies tried enveloping the French First and Second armies by their left wing\nKluck outrun its supplies and exhausted its men\ndid not stay level with Bülow\nand marched back on the Marne instead of forward on the Grand Morin;\nfinally and most importantly, by scheduling a six-week march towards France through Belgium, Germany precipitated three troubles on itself: it had to leave some of its forces behind to fight in Belgium, Britain entered the war with its five divisions and the world opinion turned against it.\nThese errors alone gave the Allies a numerical superiority, a first since the Battle of the Frontiers. Further, the French generals rose to the challenge: Joffre’s “impregnable confidence”  held the French Armies together during the 12-day retreat, Gallieni seized on the opportunity to counterattack and Clergerie organized 600 taxis to transport 6,000 troops to the front line. And yet, this “Miracle of the Marne” did not deliver France a victory either.\nThe stalemate that ensued \"suck[ed] up lives at a rate of 5,000 and sometimes 50,000 a day\". In August 1914 alone, France lost 300,000 of its 1.6 million-soldier army. \"The deadlock, fixed by the failures of the first month, determined the future course of the war and, as a result, the terms of the peace, the shape of the interwar period, and the conditions of the Second Round.\" \"The Battle of the Marne was one of the decisive battles of the world not because it determined that Germany would ultimately lose or that the Allies ultimately win the war but because it determined that the war would go on. [....] There was no turning back. The nations were caught in a trap, a trap made during the first thirty days out of battles that failed to be decisive, a trap from which there was, and has been, no exit.\"\n\n\n== Style / Genre ==\nRobert K. Massie, author of the 1994 foreword to the book, attributes its \"enormous reputation\" to four qualities: \"a wealth of vivid detail which keeps the reader immersed in events almost as an eyewitness; a prose style which is transparently clear, intelligent, controlled and witty; a cool detachment of moral judgement – Mrs. Tuchman is never preachy or reproachful: she draws on skepticism, not cynicism, leaving the reader not so much outraged by human villainy as amused and saddened by human folly. These first three qualities are present in all of Barbara Tuchman's work, but in The Guns of August, there is a fourth, which makes the book, once taken up, almost impossible to set aside. Remarkably, she persuades the reader to suspend any foreknowledge of what is about to happen[;] so great is Mrs. Tuchman's skill that the reader forgets what he knows. [...] Mrs. Tuchman's triumph is that she makes the events of August 1914 as suspenseful on the page as they were to the people living through them.\"\nTuchman knows to find and express \"the vivid specific fact which would imprint on the reader's mind the essential nature of the man or event.\" Some examples follow.\n\n\n=== Key players ===\nTuchman references almost four hundred actors in The Guns of August, General Joffre being cited the most on 125 different pages. Thirty of them receive a development of their characteristics or background.\nThe four excerpts below illustrate Robert K. Massie's remark that Tuchman can \"imprint the essential natural of the man\":\n\nJoseph Joffre was \"massive and paunchy in his baggy uniform, with a fleshy face adorned by a heavy, nearly white mustache and bushy eyebrows to match with a clear youthful skin, clam blue eyes and a candid, tranquil gaze, Joffre looked like Santa Claus and gave an impression of benevolence and naïveté – two qualities not noticeably part of his character.\" \"Joffre's supreme confidence in himself was expressed [in 1912] when his aide, Major Alexandre, asked him if he thought war was shortly to be expected. \"Certainly I think so,\" Joffre replied. \"I have always thought so. It will come. I shall fight and I shall win. I have always succeeded in what I do – as in the Sudan. It will be that way again.\" \"It will mean a Marshal's baton for you,\" his aide suggested with some awe at the vision. \"Yes.\" Joffre acknowledged the prospect with laconic equanimity.\"\n\"The short, stocky and florid Sir John French, about to take command in the field, was keyed to a pitch of valour and combativeness. His normally apoplectic expression, combined with the tight cavalryman's stock which he affected in place of collar and tie, gave him an appearance of being perpetually on the verge of choking, as indeed he often was emotionally if not physically.\"\nVladimir Sukhomlinov was \"artful, indolent, pleasure-loving, chubby [...] with an almost feline manner, who, smitten by the twenty-three year old wife of a provincial governor, contrived to get rid of the husband by divorce on framed evidence and marry the beautiful residue as his fourth wife.\"\n\"Tall, heavy, bald and sixty-six years old, Moltke habitually wore an expression of profound distress, which led the Kaiser to call him der traurige Julius (for what might be rendered \"Gloomy Gus\"; in fact, his name was Helmuth). Poor health, for which he took an annual cure at Karlsbad, and the shadow of a great uncle were perhaps cause for gloom.\"\nAside these four men, Tuchman characterises or gives the background of twenty-seven actors:\n\nFrance: Joseph Gallieni, Louis Franchet d'Espèrey, Augustin Dubail, Adolphe Messimy, Raymond Poincaré, Noël de Castelnau, Michel-Joseph Maunoury and Fernand de Langle de Cary;\nGermany: Eric Ludendorff, Alfred von Schlieffen (\"of the two classes of Prussian officer, the bullnecked and the wasp-waisted, he belonged to the second\"), Max Hoffmann, Friedrich von Bernhardi, Alexander von Kluck, Crown Prince Rupprecht, Crown Prince Wilhelm, Paul von Hindenburg, Maximilian von Prittwitz and Hermann von François;\nBritain: Jackie Fisher, Sir Edward Grey, Sir Henry Wilson and Ernest Troubridge;\nRussia: Grand Duke Nicholas, Nicholas II and Alexander Samsonov;\nBelgium: King Albert.\nIt is worth noting those actors Tuchman cites often but does not characterise, if only with a few well chosen words:\n\nFrance: Ferdinand Foch, Charles Lanrezac\nGermany: Kaiser Wilhelm II (\"possessor of the least inhibited tongue in Europe\"), Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, Max von Hausen, Karl von Bülow, Wilhelm Souchon\nBritain: Winston Churchill, Kitchener, H. H. Asquith, Richard Haldane, Archibald Murray.\n\n\n=== Key events ===\nThe introductory paragraph of A funeral, the first chapter of The Guns of August, took Barbara Tuchman \"eight hours to complete and became the most famous passage in all her work\". The Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan \"was gripped from her wonderful first sentence\":\n\nSo gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep back gasps of admiration.\nOne of the key events took place on August 1. \"In Berlin just after five o'clock a telephone rang in the Foreign Office. [...] \"Moltke wants to know whether things can start.\" At that moment, [...] a telegram, from Prince Lichnowsky, ambassador in London, reported an English offer, as Lichnowsky understood it, \"that in case we did not attack France, England would remain neutral and would guarantee France's neutrality.\" [...] The Kaiser clutched at Lichnowsky's passport to a one-front war. Minutes counted. Already mobilization was rolling inexorably toward the French frontier. The first hostile act [...] was scheduled within an hour. It must be stopped, stopped at once. But how? Where was Moltke? Moltke had left the palace. An aide was sent off with siren screaming, to intercept him. He was brought back. The Kaiser was himself again, the All-Highest, the War Lord, blazing with a new idea, planning, proposing, disposing. He read Moltke the telegram and said in a triumph: \"Now we can go to war against Russia only. We simply march the whole of our Army to the East!\" Aghast at the thought of his marvelous machinery of mobilization wrenched into reverse, Moltke refused point-blank. For the past ten years, first as assistant to Schlieffen, then as his successor, Moltke's job had been planning for this day. The Day, Der Tag, for which all Germany's energies were gathered, on which the march to final mastery of Europe would begin. It weighed upon him with an oppressive, almost unbearable responsibility.\n[...] \"Your Majesty,\" Moltke told him now, \"it cannot be done. The deployment of millions cannot be improvised. [...] Those arrangements took a whole year of intricate labor to complete\" – and Moltke closed upon that rigid phrase, the basis for every major German mistake, the phrase that launched the invasion of Belgium and the submarine war against the United States, the inevitable phrase when military plans dictate policy – \"and once settled it cannot be altered.\"\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n\n=== Miscalculations leading to war ===\nThroughout the aforementioned narrative, Tuchman constantly brings up a theme: the numerous misconceptions, miscalculations, and mistakes that she believed resulted in the tragedy of trench warfare, such as:\n\nEconomic miscalculation: Tuchman says both European intellectuals and leaders overestimated the power of free trade. They believed that the interconnectedness of European nations through trade would stop a continent-wide war from breaking out, as the economic consequences would be too great. However, the assumption was incorrect. For example, Tuchman noted that Moltke, when warned of such consequences, refused to even consider them in his plans, arguing he was a \"soldier,\" not an \"economist.\"\nUnfounded belief in quick warfare: except for a very few politicians (who were at the time ridiculed and excluded because of their views, with only Lord Kitchener having the authority to act on his anticipation of a long war), all the leaders of the major combatants believed the war would be concluded in a matter of weeks, certainly by the end of 1914. Tuchman recounted the story of a British statesman who, after he warned others that the war might last two or three years, was branded a \"pessimist.\" That false assumption had disastrous effects, especially on logistics (see below).\nOver-reliance on morale and the offensive: Tuchman details, in depth, how the leaders of the major powers, before the war, developed a philosophy of warfare based almost entirely on morale, a constant offensive, and retaining the initiative. Joffre, in particular, refused to consider going on the defensive/or even to slow the offensive, even when the realities of the battlefield demonstrated that his approach was not working.\nFailure to consider political backlash: many war planners did not take into consideration the political and treaty-based consequences of their offensive actions. As Tuchman argues, the German leaders in particular refused to consider the consequences of moving their armies into Belgium despite that country's neutrality. Despite Moltke's concerns, German generals insisted on moving through Belgium because they needed to maneuver. They failed (or refused) to realize that by invading Belgium, they effectively forced Britain to declare war because of existing treaties and national honor.\nFailure to consider adverse societal moral effects: this war as many others produced its fair amount of individual vanity and insubordination. However, the German political leaders failed to consider that some military acts can have a wider moral repercussion, which in turn can translate adversely on the military front; this is clear from the sack of Louvain, which led to public outrage and contributed to the US entering the war.\nOutdated forms of wartime etiquette: although the technology, aims, methods, and plans of World War I were significantly different from earlier wars, military leaders in occupied territories continued to have an expectation of a form of martial etiquette from civilians, regarding co-operation and obedience of instructions, as a reciprocal part of non-combatant status; which increased resentment between the citizens of the opposing nations. To illustrate, Tuchman repeatedly uses quotes from the diaries of German generals who commandeered the homes and supplies of civilians. One recurrent theme in their diary entries was that they simply could not understand why the property owners refused full co-operation, in line with traditional wartime courtesy. In a somewhat comical passage, Tuchman even quotes from a general who criticized the master of a Belgian house for failing to sit with him at dinner and observe proper mealtime etiquette despite the fact that the Germans had violated his country's neutrality, taken over his house, and stolen or destroyed much of his property.  Similar problems occurred in the practical application of submarine, and later aerial, warfare.\nOverall, Tuchman argues that while some of the war's major combatants looked forward to a war, specifically Germany and Austria-Hungary, all of them expected it to be a short one, and none of them desired or anticipated a prolonged war. Likewise, she argues that even successes, such as the First Battle of the Marne, a French victory, were to some extent accidental victories that were won despite, and not because of, military leadership or strategy.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe Guns of August is Tuchman's third book, after Bible and Sword, published in 1956, and The Zimmermann Telegram, in 1958, and by her own account \"the genesis of this book lies in [these] two earlier books I wrote, of which the First World War was the focal point of both. […] I had always thought that 1914 was the hour when the clock struck, so to speak, the date that ended the nineteenth century and began our own age, \"the Terrible Twentieth\" as Churchill called it. I felt that 1914 was it. But I did not know what should be the gateway or the framework.\" She was approached by Cecil Scott of MacMillan who asked her to write a book on 1914, particularly on the battle of Mons and on \"how had the BEF thrown back the Germans [and whether] they [had] really seen the vision of an angel over the battlefield.\" But Tuchman was more interested in writing a book on the escape of the German cruiser Goeben from the Royal Navy's Gloucester, an event that would precipitate the Ottoman Empire into the war and for which she had personal affinity since she was present, although aged only two, with her parents on a small steamer from which they witnessed this naval pursuit. But Mr Scott was not interested in that episode. In the end, \"I formed the plan of keeping to the war's first month, which contained all the roots, including the Goeben and Battle of Mons, to make us both happy.\"\nTuchman had a personal connection to the Goeben episode since she was present, as a child aged two, on a small boat nearby the pursuit: \"That morning [August 10, 1914] there arrived in Constantinople the small Italian passenger steamer which had witnessed the Gloucester's action against Goeben and Breslau. Among its passengers were the daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren of the American ambassador Mr. Henry Morgenthau.\" Being the grandchild of Henry Morgenthau, she is referring to herself as she confirmed in 1981 in her book Practicing History, in which she tells the story of her father, Maurice Wertheim, who was traveling from Constantinople to Jerusalem on August 29, 1914, to deliver funds to the Jewish community there. This connection, and her initial desire to write a book on the episode, might explain why two academic reviewers found this chapter \"long and somewhat awkward\" and \"out of context\".\nTuchman creates by combining the standard method of academic history, which is to read authentic, original material with activities more readily associated with journalism, such as field trips. Thus, to write The Guns of August, she read \"letters, telegrams, diaries, memoirs, cabinet documents, battle orders, secret codes, and billets-doux [found in] the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, the National Archives, the British Library and Public Record Office, the Bibliothèque Nationale, the Sterling Library at Yale and the Widener Library at Harvard, [and] rented a small Renault and toured the battlefield of Belgium and France .\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 1988, in her preface to the twenty-sixth anniversary of the book's second edition, Tuchman recounts how positive the reviews were when the book was published in 1962. Since she was \"hardly known to the critics […] with no reputation for them to enjoy smashing, the book received instead the warmest reception.\" One review in particular brought her to tears because it \"elicit[ed] perfect comprehension\": Clifton Fadiman's critic in the Book-of-the-Month Club Bulletin. He wrote that The Guns of August had \"a fair chance [to] turn to be a historical classic\" by displaying \"almost Thucydidean virtues: intelligence, concision, weight, detachment. […] It is [Tuchman's] conviction that the deadlock of the terrible month of August determined the future course of the war and the terms of the peace, the shape of the inter-war period and the conditions of the Second Round. […] [O]ne of the marks of the superior historian is the ability to project human beings as well as events.\"\nIn 1962, Publishers Weekly predicted the book \"will be the biggest new nonfiction seller in your winter season\", which greatly surprised Tuchman but \"as it turned out, they were right.\"\nIndeed, all reviewers have praised her narrative style, even the academic historians who have raised a few pointed critiques to The Guns of August because Tuchman had erected a rigid, deterministic thesis by relying too heavily on sources that corroborated it, ignoring, misrepresenting or downplaying factors that undermined it and veiling it with an anti-German veneer, which could be partially explained by the context of her writing as 1962 was probably the height of the Cold War.\n\n\n=== A unanimous praise of Tuchman's narrative style ===\nThe academic reviews of The Guns of August were published in two waves: for the first edition in 1962–63, and in 2013–14 on the hundredth anniversary of the start of the war and the associated 2014 re-edition of the book. Over these fifty years, Tuchman's narrative style has been constantly praised:\n\nIn 1962, the American historian Harold J. Gordon points out half a dozen major flaws but imparts in closing that Tuchman \"brings together materials from a great many sources and binds them skilfully into a clear and understandable account.\" Fellow Samuel J. Hurwitz lauds her for writing \"imaginatively, vividly, and even passionately, [with] a talent for making scenes of the past come alive, and the result is perhaps even larger than life.\" Professor John W. Oliver praises her ability to put the \"reader [in] a box seat as he watches the opening drama.\" In 1963, Ulrich Trumpener, Professor at the University of Alberta, despite writing a very critical review of her book, notes that \"in terms of sheer narrative power, The Guns of August is an admirable work.\"\nThe American historian Samuel R. Williamson Jr. starts his 2013 critical review by praising \"her narrative style [which] gives the reader a sense of intimacy with the events\" and closes it by quoting Harvard Professor Sidney Fay's: \"she had got the history wrong, but historians need to write like Tuchman or we will be out of business.\" In 2014, the Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan, Professor of International History at the University of Oxford, \"was gripped from her wonderful first sentence. \"So gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep back gasps of admiration.\" She adds further \"When I first read Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August in the autumn of 1963 it was as though history went from black and white to Technicolor\", Tuchman has this \"ability to bring the past to life, in part using what she called the corroborative detail\" and is a \"wonderful storyteller\"; lastly MacMillan loves her \"acerbic wit\" and \"sharp character sketches.\"\n\n\n=== A deterministic thesis erected on biased views framed by the Cold War ===\nThe determinism of Tuchman's thesis has been best expressed by two academic historians fifty years apart. In 1962, Professor Oron J. Hale of the University of Virginia was concerned by how Tuchman connects in a deterministic manner events that are several years, even several decades apart. He provides two such examples:\n\n\"The naval side is inadequate [with] a chapter [out of context] on the British navy's hunt for the German cruisers Goeben and Breslau in the Mediterranean and their escape to Constantinople. In a dubious chain of causation we are told that the Russian declaration of war on Turkey, in November, followed by Gallipoli, Suez, Palestine, the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, and \"the subsequent history of the Middle East, followed from the voyage of the Goeben.\"\nHe concludes his review by noting that Tuchman's \"thesis that the failure of Plan 17 and the Schlieffen Plan, which produced stalemate in the West, was the mold that determined the future course of the war, the conditions of peace and of the inter-war period, as well as the \"Second Round,\" is much too deterministic. The First World War – indeed all major wars – had many turning points. The year 1917, which brought Russian withdrawal and United States entry, was more decisive for the military outcome and the nature of the peace than was 1914.\"\nIn 2014, Margaret MacMillan, who was greatly influenced by the book, ends her positive review on a similar note: \"her main argument that entangling alliances and rigid military timetables caught Europe in a grip that led the powers inexorably towards catastrophe is no longer accepted by most historians.\"\nThis determinism is the result of four biases: i) the sources and historical research Tuchman relies upon, ii) the events she decided to exclude from her book, iii) the factors that she downplayed as they were weakening the strength of her thesis and iv) the bias she had against Germans, which is partially explained by v) the timing of the book, written in 1962 at the height of the Cold War.\n\n\n=== Ignoring historical sources and research, and relying solely on key actors' memories ===\nTuchman has ignored the major works on the origins of the war written by Sidney Fay, Luigi Albertini, Pierre Renouvin, Bernadotte Schmitt, George Gooch and William Langer.   As Professor Gordon notes: \"Forty years of historical research are ignored as the hundreds of thousands of documents that have been published by the governments of Europe.\"  He is echoed by Professor Trumpener: \"A wider utilization of primary sources would have been desirable. For example, neither the Russian and Italian document collection published since 1918 nor the captured German government files, a valuable new source, seem to have been consulted.\"  Instead, as Professor Hale concludes, she relied on \"controversial sources [i.e. retrospective works by statesmen and soldiers], which in many instances are not evaluated critically, rather than upon the solid general staff operational histories of the respective military establishments.\"\n\n\n=== Misrepresenting key military events ===\nThere is a noticeable disbalance between the minimal treatment, when mentioned at all, of the key diplomatic and military events that took place in the Balkans and on the Austro-Russian fronts on one side, and the over-emphasis of the naval chases in the Mediterranean on the other. When it comes to the first Tuchman has disregarded in particular three developments: \n\nThe Galician front – Although Tuchman recognizes that omitting the Austro-Hungarian / Serbian / Russian front was \"not entirely arbitrary\" and resulted from her decisions to strictly confine the book to August 1914, preserve \"unity\" and avoid \"tiresome length\", a few historians deplored these choices. For Professor Williamson, this \"seems unforgivable [for] there would have been no war in the West if the Russians had not decided [...] to intervene in the war on behalf of Serbia and thus attack the Habsburg monarchy.\"  Professor Hale challenges Tuchman on the rigidity of her time frame: \"[d]uring the first week of September, concurrently with the battle of the Marne, massive Russian-Austrian engagements were fought in Galicia, with results as decisive and casualties equal to those of the campaigns in France or East Prussia. All this is excluded with consequent distortion.\"  Professor Trumpener even wonders whether it is \"not obscuring some crucial issues to treat the opening Austro-Hungarian campaigns against Serbs and Russians [...] as mere side shows.\" \nThe Austrian war plan – As a direct consequence of voluntarily ignoring the Galician front \"[t]he Austrian war plan is entirely ignored and the Russian merely touched upon.\" \nThe outbreak of the war – Oron J. Hale was \"disturbed [by] the fragmented treatment of the outbreak of war. [...] The war originated in the Balkans [...] and from a local crisis grew into a general European war through the reckless diplomatic and military actions of Austrian and Russian authorities.\" \nOn the other hand, the chapter 10 dedicated to the Gloucester's chase of the Goeben and the Breslau in the Mediterranean is \"long and somewhat awkward\", \"inadequate\", \"out of context\"  and contains \"numerous inaccuracies and over-simplifications.\" \n\n\n=== Downplaying key factors ===\nProfessor Gordon points out that Tuchman's excessive focus on Germans' villainy led her to pay \"[l]ittle more than passing mention, if that, [..] to universally operating forces as nationalism, imperialism, trade rivalries, and militarism, in creating a situation where war was an increasingly acceptable solution for the problems of Europe.\"  Professor Williamson adds: \"Issues of civil-military relations, alliance structures, and the coordination of military planning receive Tuchman's modest attention at most. The role of the public opinion is only fleetingly mentioned, and economic preparation for war, though noted, gets nothing more.\" \n\n\n=== Anti-German bias ===\nFor Trumpener, Tuchman's treatment of imperial Germany is \"blatantly one-sided.\" Tuchman, according to Trumpener, transforms \"the Germans of 1914 into a nation of barbarians [...] invariably unpleasant, hysterical, or outright brutish [...] The armies, marching like 'predatory ants' across Belgium, soon reveal 'the beast beneath the German skin'. [...] Suffice it to add that one of the German generals, Alexander von Kluck, duly emerges as a 'grim-visaged Attila' and that the Prussian officer corps is, in any case, composed exclusively of 'bullnecked' or 'wasp-waisted' types.\" (All of the internal quotation marks quote passages from Tuchman's book.)\nGordon (1962) concurs with Trumpener's assessment: \"The impression given is that the war was half the result of the fecklessness of the Kaiser and half the result of the unbelievably vicious character of the German people, who forced the war upon an innocent and peace-loving civilized world. [...] Mrs Tuchman's hostility to all things German also seems to have led her to ignore such crucial developments as the Russian agreement not to mobilize against Germany and its violation.\"\nFifty years later, MacMillan (2014) is less stringent in her criticism of Tuchman's negative preconceived opinion of Germans, merely stating that \"[s]he is prone at times to absurd overstatements, for example that the German people were gripped by the idea that divine providence had destined them to be masters of the universe.\"\n\n\n=== The context of the Cold War ===\nProfessor MacMillan continues explaining Tuchman's anti-German bias as a consequence of \"[h]er view that the Germans somehow wanted to impose their culture on the world [which] is surely a reflection of that great ideological struggle of her own time between the west and the Soviet bloc.\"  Indeed, as professor Williamson, concurs: \"By 1962 America's strategic position had been significantly altered. The Soviet arsenal of nuclear missiles made the possibility of war increasingly likely. [...] Later in 1962, the Cuban crisis showed just how dangerous the chances of war might be. Not surprisingly leaders, writers and commentators looked back to 1914 to analyze what had gone wrong. [...] The American public firmly believed that the Germans were solely responsible for the Great War [...] a view of course reaffirmed by German behavior in the Second World War. \" \n\n\n== Publication ==\nThe first edition was published by MacMillan the last week of January 1962 and it stayed on the best seller list for more than forty weeks. A second edition came out in 1988, for the seventieth anniversary of the armistice, with the author's preface. In 1994, a third edition was published for the eightieth anniversary of the start of the war; Robert K. Massie wrote the foreword; it was published in the US by Random House and in Great Britain by Penguin Books.\nBy April 2024, The Guns of August has been translated in (at least) 19 languages: Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Cultural impact ===\nThe book was an immediate bestseller and was on the bestseller list of The New York Times for 42 consecutive weeks. The Pulitzer Prize nomination committee was unable to award it the prize for outstanding history because Joseph Pulitzer's will specifically stated that the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for History must be a book on American history. Instead, Tuchman was given the prize for general nonfiction.\nAccording to the cover notes of an audio version of The Guns of August, \"[President John F. Kennedy] was so impressed by the book, he gave copies to his cabinet and principal military advisers, and commanded them to read it.\" In his book One Minute to Midnight about the Cuban Missile Crisis, Michael Dobbs notes the deep impression Guns had on Kennedy. He often quoted from it and wanted \"every officer in the Army\" to read it as well. Subsequently, \"[t]he secretary of the Army sent copies to every U.S. military base in the world. Kennedy drew from The Guns of August to help in dealing with the crisis in Cuba, including the profound and unpredictable implications a rapid escalation of the situation could have. Robert S. McNamara, United States Secretary of Defense during Kennedy's presidency, recalled that \"[e]arly in his administration, President Kennedy asked his cabinet officials and members of the National Security Council\" to read The Guns of August. McNamara related that Kennedy said The Guns of August graphically portrayed how Europe's leaders had bungled into the debacle of World War I, and that Kennedy told later his cabinet officials that \"We are not going to bungle into war.\"\nThe British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who had served on the Western Front during the First World War, was also profoundly affected by the book. In his diary for Monday, 22 October 1962, he wrote:\n\nWashington, in a rather panicky way, have been urging a NATO 'alert' with all that this implies (in our case, a Royal Proclamation and the call up of Reservists). I told him that we do not repeat not agree at this stage. N. [General Norstad] agreed with this and said he thought NATO powers would take the same view. I said that 'mobilization' had sometimes caused war. Here it was absurd since the additional forces made available by 'Alert' had no military significance.\nGraham Allison, a political scientist who covered the Cuban Missile Crisis in Essence of Decision, noted the effect of Tuchman's book on Kennedy, but also its implications for the proper study of decision-making and warfare. Allison created an entire model of decision-making, which he called the Organizational Process Model, based on such issues as those covered by Tuchman, a model that directly countered game theory and other rationalistic means of explaining events.\n\n\n=== Film adaptation ===\nThe book was the basis for a 1964 documentary film, also titled The Guns of August. The 99-minute film, which premiered in New York City on December 24, 1964, was produced and directed by Nathan Kroll, narrated by Fritz Weaver (with the narration written by Arthur B. Tourtellot), and released by Universal Pictures. It used film footage found in government archives in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin, and Washington, DC.\n\n\n== References ==\nInformational notes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Guns of August at Open Library",

    "full_narrative": "A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century is a narrative history book by the American historian Barbara Tuchman, first published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1978.\nIt won a 1980 U.S. National Book Award in History.\nThe main title, A Distant Mirror, conveys Tuchman's thesis that the death and suffering of the 14th century reflect those of the 20th century, particularly the horrors of World War I and the ominous prospect of nuclear war threatening her time.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book's focus is the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages which caused widespread suffering in Europe in the 14th century. Drawing heavily on Froissart's Chronicles, Tuchman recounts the histories of the Hundred Years' War, the Black Plague, the Papal Schism, pillaging mercenaries, anti-Semitism, popular revolts including the Jacquerie in France, the liberation of Switzerland, the Battle of the Golden Spurs, and various peasant uprisings. She also discusses the advance of the Islamic Ottoman Empire into Europe until the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis. However, Tuchman's scope is not limited to political and religious events. She begins with a discussion of the Little Ice Age, a change in climate that reduced average temperatures in Europe well into the mid-19th century, and describes the lives of all social classes, including nobility, clergy, and peasantry.\nMuch of the narrative is woven around the life of the French nobleman Enguerrand de Coucy. Tuchman chose him as a central figure partly because his life spanned much of the 14th century, from 1340 to 1397. A powerful French noble who married Isabella, eldest daughter of Edward III of England, Coucy's ties put him in the middle of events.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nA Distant Mirror received much popular acclaim. A reviewer in History Today described it as an enthralling work full of \"vivid pen-portraits\". In The Spectator, David Benson called it \"an exciting and even bracing\" book which did away with many sentimental myths about the Middle Ages. It also received a favorable review in the Los Angeles Times.\nHowever, scholarly reaction was lukewarm. In the journal Speculum, Charles T. Wood praised Tuchman's narrative abilities but described the book as a \"curiously dated and old-fashioned work\" and criticized it for being shaped by the political concerns of the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Bernard S. Bachrach criticized Tuchman's reliance on secondary sources and dated translations of medieval narratives at the expense of archival research, and characterized the book as a whole as \"a readable fourteenth-century version of the Fuzz n' Wuz (cops and corpses) that dominates the evening news on television.\" Thomas Ohlgren agreed with many of Bachrach's criticisms, and further took issue with many perceived anachronisms in Tuchman's characterization of the medieval world and a lack of scholarly rigor. William McNeill, writing in the Chicago Tribune, thought that A Distant Mirror, while well-written on a technical level, did not present an intelligible picture of the period.\nDavid Dunham reviewed A Distant Mirror for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"The information density is fairly high, and it's quite readable. I recommend A Distant Mirror to anyone interested in learning more about the middle ages.\"\nThe book inspired Katherine Hoover to write her composition Medieval Suite.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nAs of 2023, all editions are re-printings with identical pagination and contents (xx, 677 pages).\n\n— (August 1978).

    "full_narrative": "Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era is a 1988 book on the American Civil War, written by James M. McPherson. It is the sixth volume of the Oxford History of the United States series. An abridged, illustrated version was published in 2003. The book won the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for History.\n\n\n== Content ==\nBattle Cry of Freedom is a narrative history of two decades of the history of the United States from the outbreak of the Mexican–American War to the Civil War's ending at Appomattox. Thus, it examined the Civil War era, not just the war, as it combined the social, military and political events of the period within a single narrative framework. Historian Hugh Brogan, reviewing the book, commends McPherson for initially describing \"the republic at midcentury\" as \"a divided society, certainly, and a violent one, but not one in which so appalling a phenomenon as civil war is likely. So it must have seemed to most Americans at the time. Slowly, slowly the remote possibility became horrible actuality; and Mr. McPherson sees to it that it steals up on his readers in the same way.\"\nA central concern of this work is the multiple interpretations of freedom. In an interview, McPherson claimed: \"Both sides in the Civil War professed to be fighting for the same 'freedoms' established by the American Revolution and the Constitution their forefathers fought for in the Revolution—individual freedom, democracy, a republican form of government, majority rule, free elections, etc. For Southerners, the Revolution was a war of secession from the tyranny of the British Empire, just as their war was a war of secession from Yankee tyranny. For Northerners, their fight was to sustain the government established by the Constitution with its guaranties of rights and liberties.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBattle Cry of Freedom was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 16 weeks on The New York Times hardcover bestseller list with an additional 12 weeks on the paperback list. Historian Mark E. Neely Jr. praised the book's wide-ranging coverage, writing that in the book McPherson \"seems equally interested in all aspects of the Civil War\" including but not limited to diplomacy, inflation, legislation, medicine, military campaigns, and prisoner-of-war exchanges. Dudley T. Cornish cited the lack of naval history as the book's \"only discernable flaw\" and further commented by saying \"the book's strongest connecting themes are the comprehensive discussions of diplomatic, economic, industrial, political, and social aspects of the nation's travail.\" Michael P. Johnson regarded the book as an overarching synthesis of evidence that refutes Walt Whitman's claim that the war should primarily be understood from the perspective of the sufferers of battle. Johnson asserts that the book classifies the Civil War as revolving primarily around the politics of slavery, and he states that its title \"invites the conceptual miscalculation: Victory = Freedom\", this characterization being Johnson's main critique. Still, he praises it for being \"as a narrative of wartime maneuvers-both political and military-[...] unsurpassed\".\nRobert Franklin Durden noted McPherson as \"in the nationalist tradition of [James Ford] Rhodes and [Allan] Nevins\" and his borrowed view of southerners as \"preemptive counterrevolutionaries\" from Arno Mayer. Harold Hyman positively compared its compactness to Peter Parish's America's Civil War (1975), but criticized its misleading phraseology regarding geographic mobility of wage earners, his use of \"women of questionable virtue\", \"troop train\" when referring to events in 1861, the exclusive riding prowess of \"the sons of Virginia gentry\", and including the greying of Robert E. Lee's beard instead of expanding on important issues such as slave marriage. However, he concluded readers \"will nevertheless reap large rewards from its pages.\" Writing for The New York Times, Brogan described it as \"...the best one-volume treatment of its subject I have ever come across. It may actually be the best ever published.\"\n\n\n== Editions ==\nMcPherson, James M. (2003) [1988]. Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era. Oxford University Press.

    "full_narrative": "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (2010) is a non-fiction book by American author Rebecca Skloot.  It was the 2011 winner of the National Academies Communication Award for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics in science, engineering or medicine.\n\n\n== About ==\nThe book is about  Henrietta Lacks and the immortal cell line, known as HeLa, that came from Lacks's cervical cancer cells in 1951. Skloot became interested in Lacks after a biology teacher referenced her but knew little about her. Skloot began conducting extensive research on her and worked with Lacks' family to create the book. The book is notable for its science writing and dealing with ethical issues of race and class in medical research. Skloot said that some of the information was taken from the journal of Deborah Lacks, Henrietta Lacks's daughter, as well as from \"archival photos and documents, scientific and historical research.\" It is Skloot's first book.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe book was originally licensed for publication in 2001 by the W.H. Freeman trade division, but within a few weeks of the contract signing, parent company Holtzbrinck/Macmillan shuttered the imprint, and the contract was handed over to their Henry Holt imprint where a sales director and an editor summarily canceled the contract. This shortsighted decision is immortalized in the movie. It took Skloot years to find new representation and a new publisher.\nThe book was initially released in hardcover, published by Crown, on February 2, 2010. On the same date, an audiobook edition was published by Random House Audio, narrated by Casandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin, as well as electronic editions in mobile (Kindle) and EPUB formats. A paperback edition was published by Broadway Books on March 8, 2011. It has also been translated into more than 25 foreign language editions.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe book was awarded the National Academies Best Book of the Year Award, the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Young Adult Science Book award, and the Wellcome Trust Book Prize, awarded annually to an outstanding work of fiction or non-fiction on the theme of health and medicine. It also won the Heartland Prize for non-fiction, among others, including a Salon Book Award, and a 100 New York Times Notable Books of the Year. The paperback edition had spent 75 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nCritical reception was largely favorable. It was named a best book of the year by more than 60 media outlets, including New York Times, Oprah, NPR, and Entertainment Weekly.\nLisa Margonelli reviewing in The New York Times Book Review said:\n\nSkloot narrates the science lucidly, tracks the racial politics of medicine thoughtfully and tells the Lacks family’s often painful history with grace. She also confronts the spookiness of the cells themselves, intrepidly crossing into the spiritual plane on which the family has come to understand their mother’s continued presence in the world. Science writing is often just about “the facts.” Skloot’s book, her first, is far deeper, braver and more wonderful. \nDwight Garner of The New York Times wrote: \n\n I put down Rebecca Skloot’s first book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, more than once. Ten times, probably. Once to poke the fire. Once to silence a pinging BlackBerry. And eight times to chase my wife and assorted visitors around the house, to tell them I was holding one of the most graceful and moving nonfiction books I’ve read in a very long time …It has brains and pacing and nerve and heart.\nOne reviewer for The New Atlantis, while mostly positive about the book, questioned its ethical arguments about tissue markets and informed consent involving scientists such as Chester M. Southam, and claimed to have found factual errors: one related to the role of HeLa cells in early space missions, and, another related to a statement in the book that says \"if all HeLa cells ever grown could have been gathered on a scale, their total weight would have measured more than 50 million metric tons.\" Skloot addresses this question on her website, where she explains how the 50 million metric tons figure was calculated, saying \"That calculation was based on the way HeLa cells are known to divide (specifically how often they double their numbers) and the amount of time they’d been alive at the time the calculation was made.\" She clarifies that \"it was a hypothetical calculation because that many cells couldn’t have been saved and put on a scale.\" She also says that the figures \"were verified before the book went to press by the scientists who did the original calculations, and outside experts.\"\n\n\n=== Academic reception ===\nThe book was adopted as a common reading text at more than 125 universities and was widely taught in high school, undergraduate, graduate and doctoral classrooms.\nIn September 2015, schools in Knox County, Tennessee were faced with demands from a parent that the book be removed from Knox County classrooms and libraries; the parent in question alleged that the scene in which Lacks discovered her tumor was depicted in a \"pornographic\" way. \n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that a television film project based on the book was in development. Oprah Winfrey and Alan Ball were teaming together to bring the biopic to HBO. HBO began production on the film in the summer of 2016. Winfrey executive-produced and starred as Deborah, the daughter of Henrietta Lacks. George C. Wolfe wrote the screenplay and directed the film. Lacks' sons and granddaughter were planned to serve as consultants. The film aired in 2017.\nIn Annihilation, a 2018 film which involves cell mutation, the character Lena, a biologist, played by Natalie Portman, reads The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrownsville Hospital Center, Elsie's asylum\nClover, Virginia, Henrietta's home town\nDundalk, Maryland, location of Turners Station in Baltimore\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Immortal Life, authors official book website (audio/video, photos)\nHenrietta Lacks Foundation, non-profit org founded by Rebecca Skloot using proceeds from the book.\nThe Lacks Family, family website.\nExcerpt from \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\",  \"Oprah Magazine, February 2010\nThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, The Sequel \"New York Times\" March 23, 2013\nYour Cells.

After researching the current mainstream view of the relevant peer-reviewed science, Kolbert estimates flora and fauna loss by the end of the 21st century to be between 20 and 50 percent \"of all living species on earth\".\n\n\n== Anthropocene ==\n\nKolbert equates current, general unawareness of this issue to previous widespread disbelief of it during the centuries preceding the late 1700s; at that time, it was believed that prehistoric mass extinctions had never occurred. It was also believed that there were no natural forces—including biological ones—powerful enough to extinguish species en masse. Likewise, in our own time, the possible finality presented by this issue results in denialism. However, scientific studies have shown that human behavior disrupts Earth's balanced and interconnected systems, \"putting our own survival in danger.\" Consequently, the Earth's systems currently affected are the global atmosphere, the water cycle, the ocean's heat absorption, ocean acidity (and its effect on coral reefs), soil moisture and drought conditions, plant destruction by pests/non-indigenous fauna or heat stress, heat regulation by the Earth's ice, and so on.\nThe human species contributes to this disruption—even without intending to—because of our innate capabilities to alter the planet at this stage of our cultural evolution; for instance, we now can harness energy from beneath the Earth's surface. Homo sapiens also can adapt relatively quickly to almost any environment on this planet's surface. Other species, however, have a hard time relocating to new, suitable habitats. They are unable to migrate ahead of current rapid ecological changes or are hampered by artificial barriers such as roadways, cityscapes, and suburban sprawl, which increase discontinuity between viable habitats throughout the world.\n\n\n== Background ==\nElizabeth Kolbert is a science writer for The New Yorker magazine. She is the author of Field Notes from a Catastrophe, as well as several other books. Her writing focuses on the effects of humans and civilization on our planet's ecosystem. Much of her writing involves her experiences of various locations, as noted above. Previously, she was a reporter for The New York Times.\nKolbert resides in Williamstown, Massachusetts, with her husband and children, and she writes in her home office across from Mount Greylock in Massachusetts.\nKolbert has been interviewed by national news and media organizations.\nKolbert's decision to write this book was influenced by a 2008 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences paper, titled, \"Are we in the midst of the sixth mass extinction? A view from the world of amphibians\". Subsequently, Kolbert wrote an article for The New Yorker, titled (similarly to her eventual book), \"The Sixth Extinction?\"\nResearching this article involved amphibian hunting in Panama. She then realized, \"I hadn't scratched the surface, that there was a book there.\"\n\n\n== Summary of chapters ==\n\n\n=== Chapter 1: The Sixth Extinction ===\nThe ancestors of frogs crawled out of water around 400 million years ago. 250 million years ago, frogs were the earliest representation of what would become the modern amphibian orders. Amphibians have been on Earth for longer than mammals or birds; they were even here before dinosaurs. Recently, it has been reported that the extinction rate of frogs is increasing. Based on observed extinction rates far beyond expected background extinction rates, we can predict that an event of a catastrophic nature is headed our way. A decade ago, Panamanian golden frogs were plentiful in numbers and easy to find around Panama. However, within the past couple of years, the frogs started to disappear. Kolbert states that studies by the National Zoological Park in Washington, DC, and a mycologist at the University of Maine, have identified the reason for the increased mortality of Panamanian frogs as a type of Chytrid fungus. However, Chytrid fungi are not naturally found in Panama. This left a puzzling question: how did the fungus get to Panama? Evidence indicates that humans were instrumental in how the fungus traveled. Kolbert uses the frog-fungus relationship as a symbol of how humans are introducing invasive species to various environments, where native species would normally have the proper distribution of alleles for their environment.\n\n\n=== Chapter 2: The Mastodon's Molars ===\nKolbert explains how fossils of the American mastodon (Mammut americanum) shaped Georges Cuvier's views on catastrophism. According to Cuvier, there was no reason the mastodon should have died out. The mastodon was large enough to avoid predation, had large enough teeth to consume an abrasive diet, and had other phenotypes that should have increased its chances of survival. Cuvier concluded there must have been sudden and violent catastrophes that caused mass extinctions of viable species. Kolbert uses the mastodon as a symbol for the idea that catastrophe is an important mechanism of extinction.\n\n\n=== Chapter 3: The Original Penguin ===\nThe great auk was a large flightless bird that lived in the Northern Hemisphere. It had a large, intricately grooved beak. When the first settlers arrived in Iceland, the auk population was probably in the millions. However, the settlers found the auks to be “very good and nourishing meat.” They also used their oily bodies for fuel and fish bait, and their feathers for stuffing mattresses. Despite attempts at protecting the species, by 1844, the last auks were killed. Kolbert uses the great auk as a symbol of how human overexploitation of resources is another important mechanism of extinction.\n\n\n=== Chapter 4: The Luck of the Ammonites ===\nKolbert explains that the main cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event was not the impact of the asteroid itself. It was the dust created by the impact. The debris from the impact incinerated anything in its path. She states that it is impossible to estimate the full extent of the various species that died out due to this catastrophe. However, one class of animals we know did die out because of the effects of the asteroid's impact, are the ammonites. Kolbert explains that, even though ammonites were 'fit' for their current environment, a single moment can completely change which traits are advantageous and which are lethal.\n\n\n=== Chapter 5: Welcome to the Anthropocene ===\nKolbert uses the extinction of graptolites and other clades to explain glaciation as a mechanism for extinction. She then explains how, when carbon dioxide levels in the air are high, there typically is an accompanying increase in temperatures and sea level. Right around the time graptolites became extinct, carbon dioxide levels dropped. Temperatures fell and sea levels plummeted. This caused a change in the chemistry of the ocean, which had a devastating impact on life forms. Kolbert states that human activity has transformed between a third and a half of the land surface on the planet. We have dammed most of the major rivers of the world, increased levels of nitrogen higher than can be fixed naturally by terrestrial ecosystems, used more than half of the world's readily accessible freshwater run-off, removed more than one-third of the primary producers of the oceans' coastal waters and changed the composition of the atmosphere by deforestation and fossil fuel combustion.\n\n\n=== Chapter 6: The Sea Around Us ===\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, we have seen increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at an alarming rate. Studies show we have added approximately 365 billion tons of it by burning fossil fuels, and an additional 180 billion tons as a result of deforestation. We add another 9 billion tons or so a year, an amount that has been increasing by 6 percent annually. Essentially, we have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air to higher than it has been in the last several million years. Some of this carbon dioxide is being absorbed by our oceans to create carbonic acid. This lowers the pH of our ocean and kills much of our marine life. Kolbert uses the drastic decline in life forms around the Castello Aragonese as a warning sign of what is to come if we continue to increase carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\n\n\n=== Chapter 7: Dropping Acid ===\nCoral reefs support thousands of species by providing food and protection. Subsequently, many species have co-evolved with corals. Due to ocean acidification, corals may become extinct by the end of the century. Before the Industrial Revolution, underwater reefs had an aragonite saturation state between 4 and 5. However, if current emission intensities remain as they are today, by 2060, there will no longer be a region above 3.5. This will lead to an increase in the energy needed for calcification. This extra energy that will eventually be expended on calcification is currently vital to corals, as they use it to recover from being eaten away by marine species and battered by waves. Thus, ocean acidification is a mechanism of extinction.\n\n\n=== Chapter 8: The Forest and the Trees ===\nGlobal warming is most commonly seen as a threat to cold-loving species. As temperatures rise, the ice at the North Pole and South Pole will melt. Any living thing that depends on the ice will be faced with extreme challenges that could ultimately drive them to extinction. Kolbert points out that the poles are not the only places affected by global warming, and that other areas have much higher latitudinal diversity gradients. She discusses the work of scientists who have used measures of species-area relationships to model the possible effects of global warming. The extent to which species are mobile and can relocate to new areas, in response to shifting climate conditions, is predicted to be a significant factor in possible species extinction. This has particular importance for trees and other plant species. Even more difficult to estimate is the extent to which ecological communities of species will be able to tolerate disruptive changes.\n\n\n=== Chapter 9: Islands on Dry Land ===\nKolbert points out how everything in life is interconnected, and discusses the importance of patch dynamics. Over time, the fragmentation of environmental areas leads to a decrease in the number of species in an area. This occurs, in part, because the size of such \"islands\" is too small to support a stable number of species members. Also, smaller populations are more vulnerable to these changing events. In addition, the disconnection of islands makes it more difficult for species to reach and recolonize them. One researcher describes this as \"an obstacle course for the dispersal of biodiversity.\" Kolbert also notes that the habits of many species can be highly specialized to their environment. She explains that one minor change can cause a domino effect in various ecological systems.\n\n\n=== Chapter 10: The New Pangea ===\nKolbert points out that there is an evolutionary arms race, in which each species must be equipped to defend against their potential predators and need to be more fit than their competition. A species has no defense if it encounters a new fungus, virus, or bacterium. This can be extremely deadly, as it was in the case of the American bats killed by the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans. Another example of this occurred in the 1800s. The American chestnut was the dominant deciduous tree in eastern American forests. Then, a fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica) started to cause chestnut blight. It was nearly 100 percent lethal. This fungus was unintentionally imported to the US by humans. Kolbert then explains that global trade and travel are creating a virtual \"Pangaea\", in which species of all kinds are being redistributed beyond historical geographic barriers. This furthers the first chapter's idea that invasive species are a mechanism of extinction.\n\n\n=== Chapter 11: The Rhino Gets an Ultrasound ===\nThe Sumatran Rhino was once so abundant in numbers it was considered an agricultural pest. However, as Southeast Asia's forests were cut down, the rhino's habitat became fragmented. In the 1900s, the rhino population had shrunk to just a few hundred. A captive breeding program was widely regarded as a failure and resulted in the deaths of several rhinos, and it was decades before a single baby was born. Today, there are only one hundred living Sumatran rhinos. Kolbert uses this rhino species to illustrate habitat fragmentation as another mechanism of extinction.\n\n\n=== Chapter 12: The Madness Gene ===\nEurope was home to the Neanderthals for at least 100,000 years. Then, about 30,000 years ago, the Neanderthals vanished. Fossil records show that modern humans arrived in Europe 40,000 years ago. Within 10,000 years, Neanderthals were bred out. Through molecular sequencing, scientists have found that there is one to four percent Neanderthal DNA in all non-African humans. This indicates that humans and Neanderthals interbred, and the resulting hybrids reproduced. The pattern continued until Neanderthals were literally bred out. Kolbert states there is every reason to believe that Neanderthals would still exist if it weren't for Homo sapiens.\n\n\n=== Chapter 13: The Things with Feathers ===\nKolbert concludes with hope in humanity, pointing to various efforts to conserve or preserve species. Whether meaning to or not, we are deciding which evolutionary pathways will be shut off forever, and which can be left open to flourish.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSome sources for the book include The Song of the Dodo by David Quammen, The Ghost With Trembling Wings by Scott Weidensaul, and reports from Edward O. Wilson, a biologist. The pioneering studies of naturalist Georges Cuvier and geologist Charles Lyell are also referenced. The book's title is similar to a 1995 book title, The Sixth Extinction, by Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin. Also included are excerpts from interviews with a forest ecologist, atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira, wildlife and conservation experts, a modern-day geologist, and fungus researchers in New England and New York State.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2014 National Book Critics Circle Award (General Nonfiction) finalist\n2014 Library Journal Top Ten Book\n2015 Massachusetts Book Award, Nonfiction\n2015 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction\nBill Gates named the book to his 2014 Summer Reading List.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nExternal links below:\n\nOfficial website\n\n\n=== Kolbert ===\nSixth Extinction: Elizabeth Kolbert.

    "full_narrative": "The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA is an autobiographical account of the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA written by James D. Watson and published in 1968. It has earned both critical and public praise, along with continuing controversy about credit for the Nobel award and attitudes towards female scientists at the time of the discovery.  \n\n\n== Significance ==\nWatson was an American molecular biologist, geneticist and zoologist, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA in 1953 with Francis Crick.\nIn 1998, the Modern Library placed The Double Helix at number 7 on its list of the 100 best nonfiction books of the 20th century. In 2012, The Double Helix was named as one of the 88 \"Books That Shaped America\" by the Library of Congress.\nSince its publication, The Double Helix has been a controversial account. Alhough it was originally slated to be published by Harvard University Press, Watson's home university, Harvard dropped the arrangement after protestations from Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and it was published instead by Atheneum in the United States and Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK.\nThe intimate first-person memoir about scientific discovery was unusual for its time. The book has been hailed for its highly personal view of scientific work, and has been criticised as caring only about the glory of priority,  with critics claiming that Watson was willing to appropriate data from others surreptitiously in order to obtain it. It has also been criticized as being disagreeably sexist towards Rosalind Franklin, another participant in the discovery, who was deceased by the time Watson's book was written.\nThe events described in the book were dramatized in a BBC television program Life Story (known as The Race for the Double Helix in the U.S.).\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nA 1980 Norton Critical Edition of The Double Helix edited by Gunther Stent, analyzed the events surrounding its initial publication. It presents a selection of both positive and negative reviews of the book, by such figures as Philip Morrison, Richard Lewontin, Alex Comfort, Jacob Bronowski, and more in-depth analyses by Peter Medawar, Robert K. Merton, and Andre Lwoff. Erwin Chargaff declined permission to reprint his unsympathetic review from the March 29, 1968, issue of Science, but letters in response from Max Perutz, Maurice Wilkins, and Watson are printed.  Also included are retrospectives from a 1974 edition of Nature written by Francis Crick and Linus Pauling, and an analysis of Franklin's work by her student Aaron Klug. The Norton edition concludes with the 1953 papers on DNA structure as published in Nature.\nIn the book Rosalind Franklin and DNA, author Anne Sayre is very critical of Watson's account. She claims that Watson's book did not give a balanced description of Rosalind Franklin and the nature of her interactions with Maurice Wilkins at King's College, London. Sayre's book raises doubts about the ethics of how Watson and Crick used some of Franklin's results and whether adequate credit was given to her. Watson had very limited contact with Franklin during the time she worked on DNA. By providing more information about Franklin's life than was included in Watson's book, it was possible for Sayre to provide a different perspective on the role Franklin played in Watson and Crick's discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. (See: King's College London DNA Controversy.)\nIn the book's preface, Watson explains that he is describing his impressions at the time of the events, and not at the time he wrote the book. In the epilogue Watson writes; \"Since my initial impressions about [Franklin], both scientific and personal (as recorded in the early pages of this book) were often wrong I want to say something here about her achievements.\" He goes on to describe her superb work, and, despite this, the enormous barriers she faced as a woman in the field of science. He also acknowledged that it took years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate Franklin's generosity and integrity.\n\n\n== An annotated and illustrated edition ==\nAn annotated and illustrated version of the book, edited by Alex Gann and Jan Witkowski, was published in November 2012 by Simon & Schuster in association with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. The new edition coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the 1962 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine to Francis Crick, James D. Watson and Maurice Wilkins. It contains over three hundred annotations on the events and characters portrayed, with facsimile letters and contemporary photographs, many previously unpublished. Their sources include newly discovered correspondence from Crick, the papers of Franklin, Pauling, and Wilkins, and they include a chapter dropped from the original edition that described Watson's holiday in the Italian Alps in 1952. The edition was favorably reviewed in The New York Times by Nicholas Wade who commented, \"anyone seeking to understand modern biology and genomics could do much worse than start with the discovery of the structure of DNA, on which almost everything else is based. This edition includes several appendices, including letters by Crick and Watson giving the first account of the discovery, a previously unpublished chapter, an account of the controversy surrounding the publication, and the unsympathetic review by the late Erwin Chargaff from the March 29, 1968, issue of Science, which he previously declined permission to reprint in the 1980 Norton Critical Edition of The Double Helix edited by Gunther Stent.\nThe book does not include the four press cuttings from the News Chronicle, Varsity and The New York Times (2) of May and June 1953 regarding the discovery of the structure of DNA, and Crick's letter of 13th April 1967 is incomplete.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nIn 1987, the memoir was adapted as a 107-minute television docudrama called Life Story for the BBC, airing on Horizon, the long-running British documentary television series on BBC Two that covers science and philosophy. The script was written by William Nicholson, and it was produced and directed by Mick Jackson. Jeff Goldblum starred as Watson, with Tim Pigott-Smith as Francis Crick, Juliet Stevenson as Rosalind Franklin, and Alan Howard as Maurice Wilkins.\nThe film won several awards in the UK and U.S., including the 1988 BAFTA TV Award as the Best Single Drama.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nJames D.

Mitton was doubtful about all the equations in the draft manuscript, which he felt would put off the buyers in airport bookshops that Hawking wished to reach. In the acknowledgements, Hawking says he was warned that for every equation in the book, the readership would be halved. So it includes only a single equation: \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        =\n        m\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}\n  \n.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\n\n=== Chapter 1: Our Picture of the Universe ===\n\nHawking begins with an anecdote about a scientist lecturing on the universe. An old woman got up and said, \"What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.\" The scientist asked what the tortoise was standing on. She replied, \"You're very clever young man, very clever. But it's turtles all the way down!\" Hawking goes on to explain why we know better.\nHe discusses the history of astronomy, starting with Aristotle's conclusions about a spherical Earth and a circular geocentric model of the universe, later elaborated upon by the second-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy. He discusses the development of the heliocentric model of the Solar System by the Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus in 1514. A century later, the Italian Galileo Galilei turned a Dutch spyglass to the heavens. His observations of Jupiter's moons provided support for Copernicus. The German astronomer Johannes Kepler formulated his laws of planetary motion, in which planets move in ellipses. Kepler's laws were explained by English physicist Isaac Newton in his Principia Mathematica (1687).\nHawking discusses how the subject of the origin of the universe has been debated over time: the perennial existence of the universe hypothesized by Aristotle and other early philosophers was opposed by St. Augustine and other theologians' belief in its creation at a specific time in the past. Immanuel Kant argued that time had no beginning. In our time, the discovery of the expanding universe implied that between 10 billion and 20 billion years ago, the entire universe was contained in one singular extremely dense place, and that it doesn't make sense to ask what happened before. He writes: \"An expanding universe does not preclude a creator, but it does place limits on when he might have carried out his job!\"\n\n\n=== Chapter 2: Space and Time ===\nHawking describes the evolution of scientific thought regarding the nature of space and time. He starts with the Aristotelian idea that the naturally preferred state of a body is to be at rest, and it can only be moved by force, implying that heavier objects will fall faster. However, Galileo experimentally disproved Aristotle's theory by observing the motion of objects of different weights and concluding that all objects would fall at the same rate. This led to Newton's laws of motion and gravity. However, Newton's laws implied that there is no such thing as absolute state of rest or absolute space: whether an object is 'at rest' or 'in motion' depends on the observer's inertial frame of reference.\nHawking describes the classical belief in absolute time, that observers in motion will measure the same time. However, Hawking writes that this commonsense notion does not work at or near the speed of light. That light travels at a finite speed was discovered by Ole Rømer through his observations of Jupiter and its moons. Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell's equations unifying electricity and magnetism predicted the existence of waves moving at a fixed speed, the same speed that had been measured for light. Physicists believed that light must travel through a luminiferous aether, and that the speed of light was relative to that of the aether. The Michelson–Morley experiment, designed to detect the speed of light through the aether, got a null result. Michelson and Morley found that the speed of light was constant regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. Combining this with a postulate that the laws of physics are the same for all observers moving relative to one another, Albert Einstein argued that the aether is superfluous if we abandon absolute time. His 1905 paper became known the special theory of relativity.\nHawking discusses two remarkable consequences of this new theory. The first is the equivalence of mass and energy: they are related by the equation \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        =\n        m\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}\n  \n. This also means that no object with mass can reach the speed of light (c = 3×108 m/s). The second consequence is a fundamental change in our ideas of 'space' and 'time'. Hawking points to the definition of the fundamental unit of length in terms of time as one example.\nIn 1915, Einstein published general relativity, which explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime. Matter and energy (including light) follow geodesics. Einstein's theory of gravity predicts a dynamic universe.\n\n\n=== Chapter 3: The Expanding Universe ===\n\nHawking describes how physicists and astronomers calculated the relative distance of stars from the Earth. Sir William Herschel confirmed the positions and distances of many stars in the night sky. In 1924, Edwin Hubble discovered a method to measure the distance using the brightness of Cepheid variable stars as viewed from Earth. The luminosity and distance of these stars are related by a simple mathematical formula. Using this, he showed that ours is not the only galaxy.\nIn 1929, Hubble discovered that light from most galaxies was shifted to the red, and that the degree of redshift is directly proportional to distance. From this, he determined that the universe is expanding. This possibility had not been seriously considered. Einstein was so sure of a static universe that he added the cosmological constant to his equations. Many astronomers also tried to avoid the implications of general relativity, with one notable exception: the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann.\nIn 1922, Friedmann made two very simple assumptions: the universe is identical wherever we are, (homogeneity), and that it is identical in every direction that we look, (isotropy). It follows that the universe is non-static. Support was found when two physicists at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, found unexpected microwave radiation coming from all parts of the sky. At around the same time, Robert H. Dicke and Jim Peebles were also working on microwave radiation. They argued that radiation from the early universe should be detectable as the cosmic microwave background. This was what Penzias and Wilson had found.\nIn 1965, Roger Penrose used general relativity to prove that a collapsing star could result in a singularity. Hawking and Penrose proved together that the universe should have arisen from a singularity. Hawking later argued this need not be the case once quantum effects are taken into account.\n\n\n=== Chapter 4: The Uncertainty Principle ===\nHawking begins by discussing nineteenth-century French mathematician Laplace's belief in scientific determinism, where scientific laws would be able to perfectly predict the future of the universe. A crack in classical physics appeared with the ultraviolet catastrophe: according to the calculations of British scientists Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans, a hot body should radiate an infinite amount of energy. In 1900, the ultraviolet catastrophe was averted by Max Planck, who proposed that energy must be absorbed or emitted in discrete packets called quanta.\nHawking discusses Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, according to which the speed and the position of a particle cannot be precisely known due to Planck's quantum hypothesis: increasing the accuracy in measuring its speed will decrease the certainty of its position and vice versa. This overturned Laplace's idea of a completely deterministic theory of the universe. Hawking describes the development by Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac of quantum mechanics, a theory which introduced an irreducible element of unpredictability into science, and despite Einstein's strong objections, has proven to be very successful in describing the universe at small scales.\n\nHawking discusses how Heisenberg's uncertainty principle implies the wave–particle duality of light (and particles in general). \nHe describes the phenomenon of interference, where multiple light waves interfere with each other to give rise to a single light wave with properties different from those of the component waves, as well as the interference within particles, exemplified by the two-slit experiment. Hawking writes that American scientist Richard Feynman's sum over histories is a useful way of visualize quantum behavior. Hawking explains that Einstein's general theory of relativity is a classical, non-quantum theory as it ignores the uncertainty principle and that it has to be reconciled with quantum theory in situations where gravity is very strong, as in a singularity.\n\n\n=== Chapter 5: Elementary Particles and Forces of Nature ===\nHawking traces the history of investigation into the nature of matter: Aristotle's four elements, Democritus's indivisible atoms, John Dalton's idea of atoms combining to form molecules, J. J. Thomson's discovery of the electron, Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus, James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron and finally Murray Gell-Mann's theorizing of  quarks which constitute protons and neutrons (collectively called hadrons). Hawking discusses the six different \"flavors\" (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top)  and three different \"colors\" of quarks (red, green, and blue). Later he discusses anti-quarks, which are outnumbered by quarks due to the expansion and cooling of the universe.\n\nHawking introduces the spin of particles. Particles can be divided into two groups. Fermions, or matter particles, have a spin of 1/2. Fermions follow Wolfgang Pauli's exclusion principle: they cannot share the same quantum state (for example, two \"spin up\" protons cannot occupy the same location in space). Without this rule, atoms could not exist. Bosons, or the force-carrying particles, have a spin of 0, 1, or 2 and do not follow the exclusion principle.\n\n Gravity is thought to be carried by gravitons, massless particles with spin 2. The electromagnetic force is carried by photons. The weak nuclear force is responsible for radioactivity and is carried by W and Z bosons. The strong nuclear force, which binds quarks into hadrons and binds hadrons together into atomic nuclei, is carried by the gluon. Hawking writes that color confinement prevents the discovery of quarks and gluons on their own (except at extremely high temperature) as they remain confined within hadrons.\nHawking writes that at extremely high temperature, the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force behave as a single electroweak force, giving rise to the speculation that at even higher temperatures, the electroweak force and strong nuclear force would also behave as a single force. Theories which attempt to describe the behaviour of this \"combined\" force are called Grand Unified Theories, which may help us explain many of the mysteries of physics.\n\n\n=== Chapter 6: Black Holes ===\n\nHawking discusses black holes, regions of spacetime where extremely strong gravity prevents everything, including light, from escaping them. The term black hole was coined by John Archibald Wheeler in 1969, although the idea is older. The Cambridge clergyman John Michell imagined stars so massive that light could not escape their gravitational pull. Hawking explains stellar evolution: how main sequence stars shine by fusing hydrogen into helium, staving off gravitational collapse. A collapsed star may form a white dwarf, supported by electron degeneracy, or a neutron star, supported by the exclusion principle. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar found that for a collapsed star of more than 1.4 solar masses, there would be nothing to halt complete gravitational collapse. He was dissuaded from this thinking by Arthur Eddington, though it later won him the Nobel Prize in Physics. The critical mass is known as the Chandrasekhar limit.\nHe describes the event horizon, the black hole's boundary from which no particle can escape. He writes: \"One could well say of the event horizon what the poet Dante said of the entrance to Hell: 'All hope abandon, ye who enter here.'\" Hawking discusses non-rotating black holes with spherical symmetry and rotating ones with axisymmetry. The discovery of quasars by Maarten Schmidt in 1963 and pulsars by Jocelyn Bell-Burnell in 1967 gave hope that black holes might be detected. Even though black holes (by definition) do not emit light, astronomers can observe them through their interactions with visible matter. A star falling into a black hole would be a powerful source of X-rays. Cygnus X-1, a powerful source of X-rays, was the earliest plausible candidate for a black hole. Hawking concludes by mentioning his 1974 bet with American physicist Kip Thorne. Hawking argued that Cygnus X-1 does not contain a black hole. Hawking conceded the bet as evidence for black holes proved overwhelming.\n\n\n=== Chapter 7: Black Holes Ain't So Black ===\nHawking discusses an aspect of black holes' behavior that he discovered in the 1970s. According to earlier theories, black holes can only become larger because nothing which enters a black hole can come out. This was similar to entropy, a measure of disorder which, per the second law of thermodynamics, always increases. Hawking and his student Jacob Bekenstein suggested that the area of a black hole's event horizon is a measure of its entropy.\nBut if a black hole has entropy, it must have a temperature, and must emit radiation. In 1974, Hawking published a new theory which argued that black holes can emit radiation. He imagined what might happen if a pair of virtual particles appeared near the edge of a black hole. Virtual particles briefly 'borrow' energy from the vacuum, then annihilate each other, returning the borrowed energy and ceasing to exist. However, at the edge of a black hole, one virtual particle might be trapped by the black hole while the other escapes. Thus, the particle takes energy from the black hole instead of from the vacuum, and escape from the black hole as Hawking radiation. According to Hawking, black holes must very slowly shrink over time and eventually \"evaporate\" because of this radiation.\n\n\n=== Chapter 8: The Origin and Fate of the Universe ===\n\nHawking recalls a conference on cosmology at the Vatican, where he was given an audience with Pope John Paul II. The Pope said it was fine to study the early universe, but scientists should not study the Big Bang itself, as that was the moment of Creation and the work of God. Hawking writes: \"I was glad then that he did not know the subject of the talk I had just given at the conference -- the possibility that space-time was finite but had no boundary, which means that it had no beginning, no moment of Creation. I had no desire to share the fate of Galileo, with whom I feel a strong sense of identity, partly because of the coincidence of having been born exactly 300 years after his death!\"\nAt the Big Bang, the universe had an extremely high temperature, which prevented the formation of complex structures like stars, or even very simple ones like atoms. George Gamow predicted that radiation from the Big Bang should still fill the present universe. This was the cosmic microwave background discovered by Penzias and Wilson. The Big Bang created hydrogen and helium, and heavier elements were forged in stars.\nThe Big Bang model was supported by the redshift of galaxies, the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundance of hydrogen and helium. But mysteries remained: Why is the universe isotropic? Why is the cosmic microwave background so homogenous? Widely separated parts of the universe have the same temperature, but there would not have been time for these regions to have come into contact. Alan Guth's model of cosmic Inflation provided an answer to this horizon problem. Inflation explains other characteristics of the universe that had previously greatly confused researchers. After inflation, the universe continued to expand at a slower pace. It became much colder, eventually allowing for the formation of such stars.\nHawking discusses how the universe might have appeared if it had expanded slower or faster than it actually has. If the universe expanded too slowly, it would collapse, and there would not be enough time for life to form. If the universe expanded too quickly, it would have become almost empty. He discusses the anthropic principle, which states that the universe has laws of physics that allow for the evolution of life because, if it didn't, we wouldn't be here.\nHawking suggests the no boundary proposal: that the universe is finite but has no beginning in imaginary time. It might merely exist.\n\n\n=== Chapter 9: The Arrow of Time ===\nHawking discusses three \"arrows of time\". The first is the thermodynamic arrow of time: the direction in which entropy increases. This is given as the explanation for why we never see the broken pieces of a cup gather themselves together to form a whole cup. The second is the psychological arrow of time, whereby our subjective sense of time seems to flow in one direction, which is why we remember the past and not the future. The third is the cosmological arrow of time: the direction in which the universe is expanding rather than contracting. Hawking claims that the psychological arrow is intertwined with the thermodynamic arrow. According to Hawking, during a contraction phase of the universe, the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time would not agree.\nHawking then claims that the \"no boundary proposal\" for the universe implies that the universe will expand for some time before contracting back again. He goes on to argue that the no boundary proposal is what drives entropy and that it predicts the existence of a well-defined thermodynamic arrow of time if and only if the universe is expanding, as it implies that the universe must have started in a smooth and ordered state that must grow toward disorder as time advances. He argues that, because of the no boundary proposal, a contracting universe would not have a well-defined thermodynamic arrow and therefore only a universe that is in an expansion phase can support intelligent life. Using the weak anthropic principle, Hawking goes on to argue that the thermodynamic arrow must agree with the cosmological arrow in order for either to be observed by intelligent life. This, in Hawking's view, is why humans experience these three arrows of time going in the same direction.\n\n\n=== Chapter 10: Wormholes and Time Travel ===\nHawking discusses whether time travel is possible. He shows how physicists have attempted to devise possible methods by humans with advanced technology may be able to travel faster than the speed of light, or travel backwards in time. Kurt Gödel presented Einstein with a solution to general relativity that allowed for time travel in a rotating universe. Einstein–Rosen bridges were proposed early in the history of the theory. These wormholes would appear identical to black holes from the outside, but matter which entered would be relocated to a different location in spacetime, potentially in a distant region of space, or even backwards in time. However, later research demonstrated that such a wormhole would not allow any material to pass through before turning back into a regular black hole. The only way that a wormhole could theoretically remain open, and thus allow faster-than-light travel or time travel, would require the existence of exotic matter with negative energy density, which violates the energy conditions of general relativity. As such, almost all physicists agree that faster-than-light travel and travel backwards in time are not possible.\n\n\n=== Chapter 11: The Unification of Physics ===\n\nQuantum mechanics and general relativity describe the universe with astounding accuracy within their own domains of applicability (atomic and cosmic scales, respectively). However, these two theories run into problems when combined. For example, the uncertainty principle is incompatible with Einstein's theory. This contradiction has led physicists to search for a theory of quantum gravity.\nHawking is cautiously optimistic that such a unified theory of the universe may be found soon, in spite of significant challenges. At the time the book was written, superstring theory had emerged as the most popular theory of quantum gravity, but this theory and related string theories were still incomplete and had not yielded testable predictions (this remains the case as of 2021). String theory proposes that particles behave like one-dimensional \"strings\", rather than as dimensionless particles. These strings \"vibrate\" in many dimensions. Superstring theory requires a total of 10 dimensions. The nature of the six \"hyperspace\" dimensions required by superstring theory are difficult if not impossible to study.\nHawking thus proposes three possibilities: 1) there exists a complete unified theory that we will eventually find; 2) the overlapping characteristics of different landscapes will allow us to gradually explain physics more accurately with time and 3) there is no ultimate theory. The third possibility has been sidestepped by acknowledging the limits set by the uncertainty principle. The second possibility describes what has been happening in physical sciences so far, with increasingly accurate partial theories.\nHawking believes that such refinement has a limit and that by studying the very early stages of the universe in a laboratory setting, a complete theory of Quantum Gravity will be found in the 21st century allowing physicists to solve many of the currently unsolved problems in physics.\n\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nHawking summarises the efforts made by humans through their history to understand the universe and their place in it: starting from the belief in anthropomorphic spirits controlling nature, followed by the recognition of regular patterns in nature, and finally with the understanding of the inner workings of the universe. He recalls Laplace's suggestion that the universe's structure and evolution could eventually be precisely explained by a set of laws whose origin is left in God's domain. However, Hawking states that the uncertainty principle introduced by quantum theory has set limits on knowledge.\nHawking comments that historically, the study of cosmology has been primarily motivated by a search for philosophical and religious insights, for instance, to better understand the nature of God, or even whether God exists at all. However, for Hawking, most scientists today who work on these theories approach them with mathematical calculation and empirical observation, rather than asking such philosophical questions. In his mind, the increasingly technical nature of these theories have caused modern cosmology to become increasingly divorced from philosophy. Hawking nonetheless expresses hope that one day everybody would understand the true origin and nature of the universe. \"That would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we know would know the mind of God\".\n\n\n== Editions ==\n1988: The first edition included an introduction by Carl Sagan that tells the following story: Sagan was in London for a scientific conference in 1974, and between sessions he wandered into a different room, where a larger meeting was taking place. \"I realized that I was watching an ancient ceremony: the investiture of new fellows into the Royal Society, one of the most ancient scholarly organizations on the planet. In the front row, a young man in a wheelchair was, very slowly, signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton ... Stephen Hawking was a legend even then.\" In his introduction, Sagan goes on to add that Hawking is the \"worthy successor\" to Newton and Paul Dirac, both former Lucasian Professors of Mathematics.\nThe introduction was removed after the first edition, as it was copyrighted by Sagan, rather than by Hawking or the publisher, and the publisher did not have the right to reprint it in perpetuity. Hawking wrote his own introduction for later editions.\n\n1994, A brief history of time – An interactive adventure. A CD-Rom with interactive video material created by S. W. Hawking, Jim Mervis, and Robit Hairman (available for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, and Windows XP).\n1996, Illustrated, updated and expanded edition: This hardcover edition contained full-color illustrations and photographs to help further explain the text, as well as the addition of topics that were not included in the original book.\n1998, Tenth-anniversary edition: It features the same text as the one published in 1996, but was also released in paperback and has only a few diagrams included. ISBN 0553109537\n2005, A Briefer History of Time: a collaboration with Leonard Mlodinow of an abridged version of the original book. It was updated again to address new issues that had arisen due to further scientific development. ISBN 0-553-80436-7\n\n\n== Adaptions ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nIn 1991, Errol Morris directed a documentary film about Hawking; although they share a title, the film is a biographical study of Hawking, and not a filmed version of the book.\n\n\n=== Apps ===\n\"Stephen Hawking's Pocket Universe: A Brief History of Time Revisited\" is based on the book. The app was developed by Preloaded for Transworld publishers, a division of the Penguin Random House group.\nThe app was produced in 2016. It was designed by Ben Courtney and produced by Jemma Harris and is available on iOS only.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nThe Metropolitan Opera commissioned an opera to premiere in the 2015–2016 season based on Hawking's book. It was to be composed by Osvaldo Golijov with a libretto by Alberto Manguel in a production by Robert Lepage. The planned opera was changed to be about a different subject and eventually canceled completely.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA Brief History of Time was included on Time magazine's list of the 100 best nonfiction books since the magazine's founding.

In the foreword to the book's 30th-anniversary edition, Dawkins said he \"can readily see that [the book's title] might give an inadequate impression of its contents\" and in retrospect wishes he had taken Tom Maschler's advice and titled it The Immortal Gene. He laments that “Too many people read it by title only.” In response, he expanded on the evolution of altruism in the BBC documentary Nice Guys Finish First.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDawkins builds upon George C. Williams's book Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966), which argued that altruism is not based upon group benefit per se, but results from selection that occurs \"at the level of the gene mediated by the phenotype\" and that any selection at the group level occurred only under rare circumstances. W. D. Hamilton and others developed this approach further during the 1960s; they opposed the concepts of group selection and of selection aimed directly at benefit to the individual organism:\n\nDespite the principle of 'survival of the fittest' the ultimate criterion which determines whether [a gene] G will spread is not whether the behavior is to the benefit of the behaver, but whether it is to the benefit of the gene G ...With altruism this will happen only if the affected individual is a relative of the altruist, therefore having an increased chance of carrying the gene.\n\n— W. D. Hamilton, The Evolution of Altruistic Behavior (1963), pp. 354–355.\n\nWilkins and Hull (2014) provide an extended discussion of Dawkins's views and of his book The Selfish Gene.\n\n\n== Book ==\n\n\n=== Contents ===\nDawkins begins by discussing the altruism that people display, indicating that he will argue it is explained by gene selfishness, and attacking group selection as an explanation. He considers the origin of life with the arrival of molecules able to replicate themselves. From there, he looks at DNA's role in evolution, and its organisation into chromosomes and genes, which in his view behave selfishly. He describes organisms as apparently purposive but fundamentally simple survival machines, which use negative feedback to achieve control. This extends, he argues, to the brain's ability to simulate the world with subjective consciousness, and signalling between species. He then introduces the idea of the evolutionarily stable strategy, and uses it to explain why alternative competitive strategies like bullying and retaliating exist. This allows him to consider what selfishness in a gene might actually mean, describing W. D. Hamilton's argument for kin selection, that genes for behaviour that improves the survival chances of close relatives can spread in a population, because those relatives carry the same genes.\nDawkins examines childbearing and raising children as evolutionary strategies. He attacks the idea of group selection for the good of the species as proposed by V. C. Wynne-Edwards, arguing instead that each parent necessarily behaves selfishly. A question is whether parents should invest in their offspring equally or should favour some of them and explains that what is best for the survival of the parents' genes is not always best for individual children. Similarly, Dawkins argues, there are conflicts of interest between males and females, but he notes that R. A. Fisher showed that the optimal sex ratio is 50:50. He explains that this is true even in an extreme case like the harem-keeping elephant seal, where 4% of the males get 88% of copulations. In that case, the strategy of having a female offspring is safe, as she'll have a pup, but the strategy of having a male can bring a large return (dozens of pups), even though many males live out their lives as bachelors. Amotz Zahavi's theory of honest signalling explains stotting as a selfish act, he argues, improving the springbok's chances of escaping from a predator by indicating how difficult the chase would be.\nDawkins discusses why many species live in groups, achieving mutual benefits through mechanisms such as Hamilton's selfish herd model: each individual behaves selfishly but the result is herd behaviour. Altruism too can evolve, as in the social insects such as ants and bees, where workers give up the right to reproduce in favour of a sister, the queen; in their case, the unusual (haplodiploid) system of sex determination may have helped to bring this about, as females in a nest are exceptionally closely related.\nThe final chapter of the first edition introduced the idea of the meme, a culturally-transmitted entity such as a hummable tune, by analogy to genetic transmission. Dawkins describes God as an old idea which probably arose many times, and which has sufficient psychological appeal to survive effectively in the meme pool. The second edition (1989) added two more chapters.\n\n\n=== Themes ===\n\n\n==== \"Selfish\" genes ====\nIn describing genes as being \"selfish\", Dawkins states unequivocally that he does not intend to imply that they are driven by any motives or will, but merely that their effects can be metaphorically and pedagogically described as if they were. His contention is that the genes that are passed on are the ones whose evolutionary consequences serve their own implicit interest (to continue the anthropomorphism) in being replicated, not necessarily those of the organism. In later work, Dawkins brings evolutionary \"selfishness\" down to creation of a widely proliferated extended phenotype.\nFor some, the metaphor of \"selfishness\" is entirely clear, while to others it is confusing, misleading, or simply silly to ascribe mental attributes to something that is mindless. For example, Andrew Brown has written:\n\n\"Selfish\", when applied to genes, doesn't mean \"selfish\" at all. It means, instead, an extremely important quality for which there is no good word in the English language: \"the quality of being copied by a Darwinian selection process.\" This is a complicated mouthful. There ought to be a better, shorter word—but \"selfish\" isn't it.\nDonald Symons also finds it inappropriate to use anthropomorphism in conveying scientific meaning in general, and particularly in this instance. He writes in The Evolution of Human Sexuality (1979):\n\nIn summary, the rhetoric of The Selfish Gene exactly reverses the real situation: through [the use of] metaphor genes are endowed with properties only sentient beings can possess, such as selfishness, while sentient beings are stripped of these properties and called machines...The anthropomorphism of genes...obscures the deepest mystery in the life sciences: the origin and nature of mind.\n\n\n==== \"Replicators\" ====\nDawkins proposes the idea of the \"replicator\":\n\nIt is finally time to return to the problem with which we started, to the tension between individual organism and gene as rival candidates for the central role in natural selection...One way of sorting this whole matter out is to use the terms 'replicator' and 'vehicle'. The fundamental units of natural selection, the basic things that survive or fail to survive, that form lineages of identical copies with occasional random mutations, are called replicators. DNA molecules are replicators. They generally, for reasons that we shall come to, gang together into large communal survival machines or 'vehicles'.\n— Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, p. 253 (Anniversary Edition)\nThe original replicator (Dawkins Replicator) was the initial molecule which first managed to reproduce itself and thus gained an advantage over other molecules within the primordial soup. As replicating molecules became more complex, Dawkins postulates, the replicators became the genes within organisms, with each organism's body serving the purpose of a 'survival machine' for its genes.\nDawkins writes that gene combinations which help an organism to survive and reproduce tend to also improve the gene's own chances of being replicated, and, as a result, \"successful\" genes frequently provide a benefit to the organism. An example of this might be a gene that protects the organism against a disease. This helps the gene spread, and also helps the organism.\n\n\n==== Genes vs organisms ====\nThere are other times when the implicit interests of the vehicle and replicator are in conflict, such as the genes behind certain male spiders' instinctive mating behaviour, which increase the organism's inclusive fitness by allowing it to reproduce but shorten its life by exposing it to the risk of being eaten by the cannibalistic female. Another example is the existence of segregation distorter genes that are detrimental to their host, but nonetheless propagate themselves at its expense. Likewise, the persistence of junk DNA that [Dawkins believed at that time] provides no benefit to its host can be explained on the basis that it is not subject to selection. These unselected for but transmitted DNA variations connect the individual genetically to its parents but confer no survival benefit.\nThese examples might suggest that there is a power struggle between genes and their interactor. In fact, the claim is that there isn't much of a struggle because the genes usually win without a fight. However, the claim is made that if the organism becomes intelligent enough to understand its own interests, as distinct from those of its genes, there can be true conflict.\nAn example of such a conflict might be a person using birth control to prevent fertilisation, thereby inhibiting the replication of his or her genes. But this action might not be a conflict of the 'self-interest' of the organism with his or her genes, since a person using birth control might also be enhancing the survival chances of their genes by limiting family size to conform with available resources, thus avoiding extinction as predicted under the Malthusian model of population growth.\n\n\n==== Altruism ====\nDawkins says that his \"purpose\" in writing The Selfish Gene is \"to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism.\" He does this by supporting the claim that \"gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism at the level of individual animals.\" Gene selection provides one explanation for kin selection and eusociality, where organisms act altruistically, against their individual interests (in the sense of health, safety or personal reproduction), namely the argument that by helping related organisms reproduce, a gene succeeds in \"helping\" copies of themselves (or sequences with the same phenotypic effect) in other bodies to replicate. The claim is made that these \"selfish\" actions of genes lead to unselfish actions by organisms. A requirement upon this claim, supported by Dawkins in Chapter 10: \"You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours\" by examples from nature, is the need to explain how genes achieve kin recognition, or manage to orchestrate mutualism and coevolution. Although Dawkins (and biologists in general) recognize these phenomena result in more copies of a gene, evidence is inconclusive whether this success is selected for at a group or individual level. In fact, Dawkins has proposed that it is at the level of the extended phenotype: \n\nWe agree [referring to Wilson and Sober's book Unto others: The evolution and psychology of unselfish behavior] that genes are replicators, organisms and groups are not. We agree that the group selection controversy ought to be a controversy about groups as vehicles, and we could easily agree to differ on the answer...I coined the [term] vehicle not to praise it but to bury it...Darwinism can work on replicators whose phenotypic effects (interactors) are too diffuse, too multi-levelled, too incoherent to deserve the accolade of vehicle...Extended phenotypes can include inanimate artifacts like beaver dams...But the vehicle is not something fundamental...Ask rather \"Is there a vehicle in this situation and, if so, why?\"\n—Richard Dawkins, Burying the Vehicle\nAlthough Dawkins agrees that groups can assist survival, they rank as a \"vehicle\" for survival only if the group activity is replicated in descendants, recorded in the gene, the gene being the only true replicator. An improvement in the survival lottery for the group must improve that for the gene for sufficient replication to occur. Dawkins argues qualitatively that the lottery for the gene is based upon a very long and broad record of events, and group advantages are usually too specific, too brief, and too fortuitous to change the gene lottery:\n\nWe can now see that the organism and the group of organisms are true rivals for the vehicle role in the story, but neither of them is even a candidate for the replicator role.  The controversy between 'individual selection' and 'group selection' is a real controversy between alternative vehicles...As it happens the outcome, in my view, is a decisive victory for the individual organism. The group is too wishy-washy an entity.\n—Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, pp. 254–255\nPrior to the 1960s, it was common for altruism to be explained in terms of group selection, where the benefits to the organism or even population were supposed to account for the popularity of the genes responsible for the tendency towards that behaviour. Modern versions of \"multilevel selection\" claim to have overcome the original objections, namely, that at that time no known form of group selection led to an evolutionarily stable strategy. The claim still is made by some that it would take only a single individual with a tendency towards more selfish behaviour to undermine a population otherwise filled only with the gene for altruism towards non-kin.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Selfish Gene was extremely popular when first published, causing \"a silent and almost immediate revolution in biology\", and it continues to be widely read. It has sold over a million copies and has been translated into more than 25 languages. Proponents argue that the central point, that replicating the gene is the object of selection, usefully completes and extends the explanation of evolution given by Charles Darwin before the basic mechanisms of genetics were understood.\nAccording to the ethologist Alan Grafen, acceptance of adaptionist theories is hampered by a lack of a mathematical unifying theory and a belief that anything in words alone must be suspect. According to Grafen, these difficulties along with an initial conflict with population genetics models at the time of its introduction \"explains why within biology the considerable scientific contributions it [The Selfish Gene] makes are seriously underestimated, and why it is viewed mainly as a work of exposition.\" According to comparative psychologist Nicky Hayes, \"Dawkins presented a version of sociobiology that rested heavily on metaphors drawn from animal behavior, and extrapolated these...One of the weaknesses of the sociological approach is that it tends only to seek confirmatory examples from among the huge diversity of animal behavior. Dawkins did not deviate from this tradition.\" More generally, critics argue that The Selfish Gene oversimplifies the relationship between genes and the organism. (As an example, see Thompson.)\nThe Selfish Gene further popularised sociobiology in Japan after its translation in 1980. With the addition of Dawkins's book to the country's consciousness, the term \"meme\" entered popular culture. Yuzuru Tanaka of Hokkaido University wrote a book, Meme Media and Meme Market Architectures, while the psychologist Susan Blackmore wrote The Meme Machine (2000), with a foreword by Dawkins. The information scientist Osamu Sakura has published a book in Japanese and several papers in English on the topic. Nippon Animation produced an educational television program titled The Many Journeys of Meme.\nIn 1976, the ecologist Arthur Cain, one of Dawkins's tutors at Oxford in the 1960s, called it a \"young man's book\" (which Dawkins points out was a deliberate quote of a commentator on the New College, Oxford philosopher A. J. Ayer's Language, Truth, and Logic (1936)). Dawkins noted that he had been \"flattered by the comparison, [but] knew that Ayer had recanted much of his first book and [he] could hardly miss Cain's pointed implication that [he] should, in the fullness of time, do the same.\" This point also was made by the philosopher Mary Midgley: \"The same thing happened to AJ Ayer, she says, but he spent the rest of his career taking back what he'd written in Language, Truth and Logic. \"This hasn't occurred to Dawkins\", she says. \"He goes on saying the same thing.\"\" However, according to Wilkins and Hull, Dawkins's thinking has developed, although perhaps not defusing this criticism:\n\nIn Dawkins's early writings, replicators and vehicles played different but complementary and equally important roles in selection, but as Dawkins honed his view of the evolutionary process, vehicles became less and less fundamental...In later writings Dawkins goes even further and argues that phenotypic traits are what really matter in selection and that they can be treated independently of their being organized into vehicles...Thus, it comes as no surprise when Dawkins  proclaims that he \"coined the term 'vehicle' not to praise it but to bury it.\" As prevalent as organisms might be, as determinate as the causal roles that they play in selection are, reference to them can and must be omitted from any perspicuous characterization of selection in the evolutionary process. Dawkins is far from a genetic determinist, but he is certainly a genetic reductionist.\n— John S Wilkins, David Hull, Dawkins on Replicators and Vehicles, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\nIn Humankind: A Hopeful History, Rutger Bregman contrasts the portrayal of human nature in The Selfish Gene with a more cooperative view.\n\n\n=== Units of selection ===\nAs to the unit of selection: \"One internally consistent logical picture is that the unit of replication is the gene,...and the organism is one kind of ...entity on which selection acts directly.\" Dawkins proposed the matter without a distinction between 'unit of replication' and 'unit of selection' that he made elsewhere: \"the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even strictly the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity.\" However, he continues in a later chapter:\n\nOn any sensible view of the matter Darwinian selection does not work on genes directly. ...The important differences between genes emerge only in their effects. The technical word phenotype is used for the bodily manifestation of a gene, the effect that a gene has on the body...Natural selection favours some genes rather than others not because of the nature of the genes themselves, but because of their consequences—their phenotypic effects...But we shall now see that the phenotypic effects of a gene need to be thought of as all the effects that it has on the world. ...The phenotypic effects of a gene are the tools by which it levers itself into the next generation. All I am going to add is that the tools may reach outside the individual body wall...Examples that spring to mind are artefacts like beaver dams, bird nests, and caddis houses.\n— Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, Chapter 13, pp. 234, 235, 238\nDawkins's later formulation is in his book The Extended Phenotype (1982), where the process of selection is taken to involve every possible phenotypical effect of a gene.\nStephen Jay Gould finds Dawkins's position tries to have it both ways:\n\nDawkins claims to prefer genes and to find greater insight in this formulation. But he allows that you or I might prefer organisms—and it really doesn't matter.\n— Stephen Jay Gould, The Structure of Evolutionary Theory, pp. 640-641\nThe view of The Selfish Gene is that selection based upon groups and populations is rare compared to selection on individuals. Although supported by Dawkins and by many others, this claim continues to be disputed. While naïve versions of group selectionism have been disproved, more sophisticated formulations make accurate predictions in some cases while positing selection at higher levels. Both sides agree that very favourable genes are likely to prosper and replicate if they arise and both sides agree that living in groups can be an advantage to the group members. The conflict arises in part over defining concepts: \n\nCultural evolutionary theory, however, has suffered from an overemphasis on the experiences and behaviors of individuals at the expense of acknowledging complex group organization...Many important behaviors related to the success and function of human societies are only properly defined at the level of groups.\nIn The Social Conquest of Earth (2012), the entomologist E. O. Wilson contends that although the selfish-gene approach was accepted \"until 2010 [when] Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita, and I demonstrated that inclusive fitness theory, often called kin selection theory, is both mathematically and biologically incorrect.\" Chapter 18 of The Social Conquest of Earth describes the deficiencies of kin selection and outlines group selection, which Wilson argues is a more realistic model of social evolution. He criticises earlier approaches to social evolution, saying: \"unwarranted faith in the central role of kinship in social evolution has led to the reversal of the usual order in which biological research is conducted. The proven best way in evolutionary biology, as in most of science, is to define a problem arising during empirical research, then select or devise the theory that is needed to solve it. Almost all research in inclusive-fitness theory has been the opposite:  hypothesize the key roles of kinship and kin selection, then look for evidence to test that hypothesis.\" According to Wilson: \"People must have a tribe...Experiments conducted over many years by social psychologists have revealed how swiftly and decisively people divide into groups, and then discriminate in favor of the one to which they belong.\" (pp. 57, 59) According to Wilson: \"Different parts of the brain have evolved by group selection to create groupishness.\" (p. 61)\nSome authors consider facets of this debate between Dawkins and his critics about the level of selection to be blather:\n\n\"The particularly frustrating aspects of these constantly renewed debates is that, even though they seemed to be sparked by rival theories about how evolution works, in fact they often involve only rival metaphors for the very same evolutionary logic and [the debates over these aspects] are thus empirically empty.\"\n— Laurent Keller, Levels of Selection in Evolution, p.4\nOther authors say Dawkins has failed to make some critical distinctions, in particular, the difference between group selection for group advantage and group selection conveying individual advantage.\n\n\n=== Choice of words ===\nA good deal of objection to The Selfish Gene stemmed from its failure to be always clear about \"selection\" and \"replication\". Dawkins says the gene is the fundamental unit of selection, and then points out that selection does not act directly upon the gene, but upon \"vehicles\" or '\"extended phenotypes\". Stephen Jay Gould took exception to calling the gene a 'unit of selection' because selection acted only upon phenotypes. Summarizing the Dawkins-Gould difference of view, Sterelny says:\n\nGould thinks gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes.\n—Kim Sterelny: Dawkins vs. Gould, p. 83\nThe word \"cause\" here is somewhat tricky: does a change in lottery rules (for example, inheriting a defective gene \"responsible\" for a disorder) \"cause\" differences in outcome that might or might not occur? It certainly alters the likelihood of events, but a concatenation of contingencies decides what actually occurs. Dawkins thinks the use of \"cause\" as a statistical weighting is acceptable in common usage. Like Gould, Gabriel Dover in criticizing The Selfish Gene says:\n\nIt is illegitimate to give 'powers' to genes, as Dawkins would have it, to control the outcome of selection...There are no genes for interactions, as such: rather, each unique set of inherited genes contributes interactively to one unique phenotype...the true determinants of selection.\n— Gabriel Dover: Dear Mr. Darwin, p. 56\nHowever, from a comparison with Dawkins's discussion of this very same point, it would seem both Gould's and Dover's comments are more a critique of his sloppy usage than a difference of views. Hull suggested a resolution based upon a distinction between replicators and interactors. The term \"replicator\" includes genes as the most fundamental replicators but possibly other agents, and interactor includes organisms but maybe other agents, much as do Dawkins's 'vehicles'. The distinction is as follows:\n\nreplicator: an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in successive replications.\ninteractor: an entity that interacts as a cohesive whole with its environment in such a way that this interaction causes replication to be differential.\nselection: a process in which the differential extinction or proliferation of interactors causes the differential perpetuation of the replicators that produced them.\nHull suggests that, despite some similarities, Dawkins takes too narrow a view of these terms, engendering some of the objections to his views. According to Godfrey-Smith, this more careful vocabulary has cleared up \"misunderstandings in the \"units of selection\" debates.\"\n\n\n=== Enactive arguments ===\nBehavioural genetics entertains the view:\n\nthat genes are dynamic contributors to behavioral organization and are sensitive to feedback systems from the internal and external environments. Technically behavior is not inherited; only DNA molecules are inherited. From that point on behavioral formation is a problem of constant interplay between genetic potential and environmental shaping.\n—D.D. Thiessen, Mechanism specific approaches in behavior genetics, p. 91\nThis view from 1970 is still espoused today, and conflicts with Dawkins's view of \"the gene as a form of \"information [that] passes through bodies and affects them, but is not affected by them on its way through\"\". The philosophical/biological field of enactivism stresses the interaction of the living agent with its environment and the relation of probing the environment to cognition and adaptation. Gene activation depends upon the cellular milieu. An extended discussion of the contrasts between enactivism and Dawkins's views, and with their support by Dennett, is provided by Thompson.\nIn Mind in Life, the philosopher Evan Thompson has assembled a multi-sourced objection to the \"selfish gene\" idea. Thompson takes issue with Dawkin's reduction of \"life\" to \"genes\" and \"information\":\n\nLife is just bytes and bytes and bytes of digital information.\n— Richard Dawkins: River out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life, p. 19\nOn the bank of the Oxford canal...is a large willow tree, and it is pumping downy seeds into the air...It is raining instructions out there; it's raining programs; it's raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading algorithms. That is not a metaphor, it is the plain truth.\n— Richard Dawkins: The Blind Watchmaker, p. 111\nThompson objects that the gene cannot operate by itself, since it requires an environment such as a cell, and life is \"the creative outcome of highly structured contingencies\". Thompson quotes Sarkar:\n\nthere is no clear technical notion of \"information\" in molecular biology. It is little more than a metaphor that masquerades as a theoretical concept and ...leads to a misleading picture of the nature of possible explanations in molecular biology.\n— Sahotra Sarkar Biological information: a skeptical look at some central dogmas of molecular biology, p. 187\nThompson follows with a detailed examination of the concept of DNA as a look-up-table and the role of the cell in orchestrating the DNA-to-RNA transcription, indicating that by anyone's account the DNA is hardly the whole story. Thompson goes on to suggest that the cell-environment interrelationship has much to do with reproduction and inheritance, and a focus on the gene as a form of \"information [that] passes through bodies and affects them but is not affected by them on its way through\" is tantamount to adoption of a form of material-informational dualism that has no explanatory value and no scientific basis. (Thomson, p. 187) The enactivist view, however, is that information results from the probing and experimentation of the agent with the agent's environment subject to the limitations of the agent's abilities to probe and process the result of probing, and DNA is simply one mechanism the agent brings to bear upon its activity.\n\n\n=== Moral arguments ===\nAnother criticism of the book is its treatment of morality, and more particularly altruism, as existing only as a form of selfishness:\n\nIt is important to realize that the above definitions of altruism and selfishness are behavioural, not subjective. I am not concerned here with the psychology of motives...My definition is concerned only with whether the effect of an act is to lower or raise the survival prospects of the presumed altruist and the survival prospects of the presumed beneficiary.\n— Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, p. 12\nWe can even discuss ways of cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism, something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world.\n— Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, p. 179\nThe philosopher Mary Midgley has suggested this position is a variant of Hobbes's explanation of altruism as enlightened self-interest, and that Dawkins goes a step further to suggest that our genetic programming can be overcome by what amounts to an extreme version of free will. Part of Mary Midgley's concern is that Richard Dawkins's account of The Selfish Gene serves as a moral and ideological justification for selfishness to be adopted by modern human societies as simply following \"nature\", providing an excuse for behavior with bad consequences for future human society.\nDawkins's major concluding theme, that humanity is finally gaining power over the \"selfish replicators\" by virtue of their intelligence, is criticized also by primatologist Frans de Waal, who refers to it as an example of a \"veneer theory\" (the idea that morality is not fundamental, but is laid over a brutal foundation). Dawkins claims he merely describes how things are under evolution, and makes no moral arguments. On BBC-2 TV, Dawkins pointed to evidence for a \"Tit-for-Tat\" strategy (shown to be successful in game theory) as the most common, simple, and profitable choice.\nMore generally, the objection has been made that The Selfish Gene discusses philosophical and moral questions that go beyond  biological arguments, relying upon anthropomorphisms and careless analogies.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nThe Selfish Gene was first published by Oxford University Press in 1976 in eleven chapters with a preface by the author and a foreword by Robert Trivers. A second edition was published in 1989. This edition added two extra chapters, and substantial endnotes to the preceding chapters, reflecting new findings and thoughts. It also added a second preface by the author, but the original foreword by Trivers was dropped. The book contains no illustrations.\nThe book has been translated into at least 23 languages including Arabic, Thai and Turkish.\nIn 2006, a 30th-anniversary edition was published with the Trivers foreword and a new introduction by the author in which he states, \"This edition does, however---and it is a source of particular joy to me---restore the original Foreword by Robert Trivers.\"  This edition was accompanied by a festschrift entitled Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think (2006). In March 2006, a special event entitled The Selfish Gene: Thirty Years On was held at the London School of Economics. In March 2011, Audible Inc published an audiobook edition narrated by Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward.\nIn 2016, Oxford University Press published The Extended Selfish Gene, a 40th anniversary edition with a new epilogue, in which Dawkins describes the continued relevance of the gene's eye view of evolution and states that it, along with coalescence analysis \"illuminates the deep past in ways of which I had no inkling when I first wrote The Selfish Gene...\" It contains two chapters from his later The Extended Phenotype. He credits Yan Wong, \"my co-author of The Ancestor's Tale, from whom I learned everything I know about coalescence theory and much else besides.\" \n\n\n=== Editions ===\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nIn April 2016, The Selfish Gene was listed in The Guardian's list of the 100 best nonfiction books, by Robert McCrum.\n\nIan McEwan writes that  There has never been a science book quite like it. Drawing on the work of a handful of scientists, it bound together genetics and Darwinian natural selection in a creative synthesis that amazed even those few who were already familiar with the concepts. It hastened a sea change in evolutionary theory, it affected profoundly the teaching of biology, it enticed an enthusiastic younger generation into the subject, and spawned a huge literature, and eventually a new discipline - memetics. At the same time, and this is the measure of its achievement, it addressed itself without condescension to the layman. It did so provocatively, and with style.\nIn the years since then, Dawkins' work might be seen as one extended invitation addressed to us non-scientists to enjoy science, to indulge ourselves at a feast of human ingenuity. Just as we can sit around the kitchen table and discuss operas, movies or novels without being composers, directors or novelists, so we can engage with this subject, one more sublime achievement of accumulated creativity. We can make it \"ours\" just as we might the music of Bach or Bill Evans.\n\nThe Selfish Gene stood at the beginning of a golden age of science writing. With a fine sense of literary tradition, the physicist Steven Weinberg, in his book Dreams of a Final Theory, revisited  Huxley's  lecture on chalk in order to make the case for reductionism. Steven Pinker's application of Darwinian thought to Chomskyan linguistics in The Language Instinct is one of the finest celebrations of language I know. Among many other indispensable 'classics', I would propose EO Wilson's The Diversity of Life on the ecological wonders of the Amazon rain forest, and on the teeming micro-organisms in a handful of soil; David Deutsch's masterly account of the Many Worlds theory in The Fabric of Reality; Jared Diamond's melding of history with biological thought in Guns, Germs and Steel...\nWeinberg included it on his list of the 13 best science books for the general reader.\nIn July 2017, a poll to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Royal Society Science Book Prize listed The Selfish Gene as the most influential science book of all time.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nThe Making of the Fittest (2006) by Sean B.

He also presents arguments to refute certain criticisms made of his first book, The Selfish Gene. (Both books espouse the gene-centered view of evolution.) It was illustrated by Liz Pyle. It won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Current interest. A computer program of the same name was released and it was the basis for a BBC  documentary. An audiobook was released, read by Dawkins and Lalla Ward.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe title of the book refers to the watchmaker analogy made famous by William Paley in his 1802 book Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity. Paley, writing long before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, held that the complexity of living organisms was evidence of the existence of a divine creator by drawing a parallel with the way in which the existence of a watch compels belief in an intelligent watchmaker. Dawkins, in contrasting the differences between human design and its potential for planning with the workings of natural selection, therefore dubbed evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n1. Explaining the Very Improbable\nDawkins addresses the argument from design. He emphasizes that natural selection is nonrandom (since only adaptive traits are selected for) and cumulative (as adaptive traits accumulate).\n2. Good Design\nDawkins discusses the evolution of  echolocation in bats. Many animals have some ability to navigate by sound. Such abilities can be honed by natural selection to produce the sophisticated sonar seen in bats.\n3. Accumulating Small Change\nDawkins writes that \"We have seen that living things are too improbable and too beautifully 'designed' to have come into existence by chance. How then, did they come into existence? The answer, Darwin's answer, is by gradual, step-by-step transformations from simple beginnings. ... Each successive change in the gradual evolutionary process was simple enough, relative to its predecessor, to have arisen by chance. But the whole sequence of cumulative steps constitutes anything but a chance process. ... The cumulative process is directed by non-random survival.\"\nDawkins illustrates the difference between the potential for the development of complexity as a result of pure randomness, as opposed to that of randomness coupled with cumulative selection. He demonstrates this by the example of the weasel program. Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer simulation of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind Watchmaker, which was sold separately as a teaching aid.\nThe program displayed a two-dimensional shape (a \"biomorph\") made up of straight black lines, the length, position, and angle of which were defined by a simple set of rules and instructions (analogous to a genome). Adding new lines (or removing them) based on these rules offered a discrete set of possible new shapes (mutations), which were displayed on screen so that the user could choose between them. The chosen mutation would then be the basis for another generation of biomorph mutants to be chosen from, and so on. Thus, the user, by selection, could steer the evolution of biomorphs. This process often produced images which were reminiscent of real organisms, for instance beetles, bats, or trees. Dawkins speculated that the unnatural selection role played by the user in this program could be replaced by a more natural agent if, for example, colourful biomorphs could be selected by butterflies or other insects, via a touch-sensitive display set up in a garden.\n4: Making Tracks Through Animal Space\nDawkins looks at the evolution of the eye. Many animals have a patch of light-sensitive cells. Natural selection would favor the formation of a \"cup\" which can detect direction. From there you can get a pinhole camera eye, as seen in the chambered nautilus. The addition of a lens results in the cephalopod eye. \"For each of these types of eye, stages corresponding to evolutionary intermediates exist as working eyes among modern animals.\" Any improvements would be favored by natural selection. In fact, eyes have evolved several times independently, an example of convergent evolution. He returns to echolocation, noting that \"Any animal that can hear at all may hear echoes. Blind humans frequently learn to make use of these echoes. A rudimentary version of such a skill in ancestral mammals would have provide ample raw material for natural selection to build upon, leading by gradual degrees to the high perfection of bats.\" Echolocation also seems to have evolved several times independently, another example of convergent evolution.\n5. The power and the archives\nDawkins looks at genetics. Gregor Mendel discovered that inheritance is particulate. R. A. Fisher united Darwin and Mendel in the modern synthesis.\n6. Origins and miracles\nDawkins looks at the origin of life, including the work of Graham Cairns-Smith.\n7. Constructive evolution\nDawkins looks at evolutionary arms races between predator and prey, and the Red Queen's hypothesis. Gene duplication is introduced as a means of increasing a species's genetic capacity.\n8. Explosions and spirals\nDawkins looks at Darwin's concept of sexual selection, revived by R. A. Fisher.  It is thought that peacocks evolved colorful plumage to attract peahens. But the peahens are also passing along genes preferring plumage. This is an example of linkage disequilibrium, which can lead to runaway evolution.\n9. Puncturing punctualism\nDawkins examines the punctuated equilibrium theory of Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould.\n10. The one true tree of life\nDawkins examines molecular taxonomy. Neutral mutations serve as molecular clocks that allow us to tell when species diverged.\n11: Doomed rivals\n\nDawkins examines alternatives to natural selection, like Lamarckism, and finds them wanting.\nIn an appendix to the 1996 edition, Dawkins explains how his experiences \nwith computer models led him to a greater appreciation of the role of embryological constraints on natural selection. In particular, he recognised that certain patterns of embryological development could lead to the success of a related group of species in filling varied ecological niches, though he emphasised that this should not be confused with group selection. He dubbed this insight the evolution of evolvability.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nTim Radford, writing in The Guardian, noted that despite Dawkins's \"combative secular humanism\", he had written \"a patient, often beautiful book... that begins in a generous mood and sustains its generosity to the end.\" 30 years on, people still read the book, Radford argues, because it is \"one of the best books ever to address, patiently and persuasively, the question that has baffled bishops and disconcerted dissenters alike: how did nature achieve its astonishing complexity and variety?\"\nPhilosopher and historian of biology Michael T. Ghiselin, writing in The New York Times, comments that Dawkins \"succeeds admirably in showing how natural selection allows biologists to dispense with such notions as purpose and design\". He notes that analogies with computer programs have their limitations, but are still useful. Ghiselin observes that Dawkins is \"not content with rebutting creationists\" but goes on to press home his arguments against alternative theories to neo-Darwinism. He thinks the book fills the need to know more about evolution that creationists \"would conceal from them.\" He concludes that \"Readers who are not outraged will be delighted.\"\nKenneth R. Miller writes that Dawkins \"brilliantly explains how complex mechanisms and structures are put together by the process of evolution\" adding \"It is true that he makes certain theological points that I don’t agree with.\"\nJerry Coyne also recommends the book: \"I’ve always thought of Dawkins as an extremely smart child. He is not a child of course, he’s a really brilliant man. But he looks at things with the eyes of a child, in a way that I don’t think any scientist who wrote really well, including Stephen Jay Gould, ever could. He sees things with this fresh viewpoint that brings them alive.\"\nThe American philosopher of religion Dallas Willard, reflecting on the book, denies the connection of evolution to the validity of arguments from design to God: whereas, he asserts, Dawkins seems to consider the arguments to rest entirely on that basis. Willard argues that Chapter 6, \"Origins and Miracles\", attempts the \"hard task\" of making not just a blind watchmaker but \"a blind watchmaker watchmaker\", which he comments would have made an \"honest\" title for the book. He notes that Dawkins demolishes several \"weak\" arguments, such as the argument from personal incredulity. He denies that Dawkins's computer \"exercises\" and arguments from gradual change show that complex forms of life could have evolved. Willard concludes by arguing that in writing this book, Dawkins is not functioning as a scientist \"in the line of Darwin\", but as \"just a naturalist metaphysician\".\n\n\n== Influence ==\nThe engineer Theo Jansen read the book in 1986 and became fascinated by evolution and natural selection.

Published on September 27, 1962, the book documented the environmental harm caused by the indiscriminate use of DDT, a pesticide used by soldiers during World War II.

The result of her research was Silent Spring, which brought environmental concerns to the American public. The book was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, but it swayed public opinion and led to a reversal in US pesticide policy, a nationwide ban on DDT for agricultural uses, and an environmental movement that led to the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency.\nIn 2006, Silent Spring was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by the editors of Discover magazine.\n\n\n== Research and writing ==\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Carson became concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science after World War II. The United States Department of Agriculture's 1957 fire ant eradication program, which involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides mixed with fuel oil and included the spraying of private land, prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. Landowners in Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future, laying the basis for later environmental actions.\nThe impetus for Silent Spring was a letter written in January 1958 by Carson's friend, Olga Owens Huckins, to The Boston Herald, describing the death of birds around her property in Duxbury, Massachusetts, resulting from the aerial spraying of DDT to kill mosquitoes, a copy of which Huckins sent to Carson. Carson later wrote that this letter prompted her to study the environmental problems caused by the overuse of chemical pesticides.\nThe Audubon Naturalist Society actively opposed chemical spraying programs and recruited Carson to help publicize the US government's spraying practices and related research. Carson began the four-year project of Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She tried to enlist essayist E. B. White and a number of journalists and scientists to her cause. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it became a solo project. Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring.\nAs her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides. She took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information on the subject. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods, such as biological pest control.\n\nBy 1959, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, Fire Ants on Trial; Carson called it \"flagrant propaganda\" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in The Washington Post, that attributed the recent decline in bird populations—in her words, the \"silencing of birds\"—to pesticide overuse. The same year, the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of US cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she was discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible \"financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs\".\nResearch at the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of National Cancer Institute researcher and founding director of the environmental cancer section Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.\nBy 1960, Carson had sufficient research material and the writing was progressing rapidly. She had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the resulting human sickness and ecological damage. In January 1960, she suffered an illness which kept her bedridden for weeks, delaying the book. As she was nearing full recovery in March, she discovered cysts in her left breast, requiring a mastectomy. By December that year, Carson discovered that she had breast cancer, which had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for a discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of some new pesticides. However, further health troubles delayed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.\nThe work's title was inspired by a poem by John Keats, \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\", which contained the lines \"The sedge is wither'd from the lake, And no birds sing.\" \"Silent Spring\" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: Silent Spring would be a metaphorical title for the entire book—suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world—rather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong. With Carson's approval, editor Paul Brooks at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, \"A Fable for Tomorrow\", which was intended to provide the fact that something like the story in the book could happen any time in the near future. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing and were planning to promote the book by sending the manuscript to select individuals for final suggestions. In Silent Spring, Carson relied on evidence from two New York state organic farmers, Marjorie Spock and Mary Richards, and that of biodynamic farming advocate Ehrenfried Pfeiffer in developing her case against DDT.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe overarching theme of Silent Spring is the powerful—and often negative—effect humans have on the natural world. Carson's main argument is that pesticides have detrimental effects on the environment; she says these are more properly termed \"biocides\" because their effects are rarely limited to solely targeting pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides—many of which are subject to bioaccumulation—are scrutinized. Carson accuses the chemical industry of intentionally spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides. About DDT and cancer, Carson says only:\n\nIn laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them, but felt there was some \"justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell carcinomas\". Dr. Hueper [author of Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases] now gives DDT the definite rating of a \"chemical carcinogen\".\nCarson predicts increased consequences in the future, especially since targeted pests may develop resistance to pesticides and weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated invasive species. The book closes with a call for a biotic approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.\nCarson never called for an outright ban on DDT. She said in Silent Spring that even if DDT and other insecticides had no environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counterproductive because it would create insect resistance to pesticides, making them useless in eliminating the target insect populations:\n\nNo responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease through the control of insect vectors of infection, but it has heard little of the other side of the story—the defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very means of fighting.\nCarson also said that \"Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes\", and quoted the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: \"Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity'. Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.\"\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nAt the time the book was written, environmental issues were excluded from mainstream political conversation in America. However, Carson believed that governments should consider what environmental impact a policy may have before implementing it; for example, in chapter 10 she describes a pesticide program from 1957 that was intended to control the spread of fire ants:With the development of chemicals of broad lethal powers, there came a sudden change in the official attitude towards the fire ant. In 1957 the United States Department of Agriculture launched one of the most remarkable publicity campaigns in its history. The fire ant suddenly became the target of a barrage of government releases, motion pictures, and government-inspired stories portraying it as a despoiler of southern agriculture and a killer of birds, livestock, and man. A mighty campaign was announced, in which the federal government in cooperation with the afflicted states would ultimately treat some 20,000,000 acres in nine southern states.Despite calls from experts to consider the damage using the pesticides could bring to the environment, the Agriculture Department dismissed the objections and continued on with the program:Urgent protests were made by most of the state conservation departments, by national conservation agencies, and by ecologists and even by some entomologists, calling upon the then Secretary of Agriculture, Ezra Benson, to delay the program at least until some research had been done to determine the effects of heptachlor and dieldrin on wild and domestic animals and to find the minimum amount that would control the ants. The protests were ignored and the program was launched in 1958. A million acres were treated the first year. It was clear that any research would be in the nature of a post mortem.After the program, an increased number of birds, cattle, horses and other wildlife were found dead in the areas where the pesticides had been sprayed. To make matters worse, the heptachlor and dieldrin sprayed accomplished nothing, instead creating more infested areas. Had the government researched the impact the chemicals could have on wildlife they could have prevented the deaths and environmental damage and saved the taxpayer's money. Overall, Silent Spring not only uncovered the many negative effects pesticides have on the environment but also asked for environmental issues to be discussed and treated seriously within the political sphere.\n\n\n== Promotion and reception ==\nCarson and the others involved with publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism and were concerned about the possibility of being sued for libel. Carson was undergoing radiation therapy for her cancer and expected to have little energy to defend her work and respond to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass prominent supporters before the book's release.\nMost of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of Silent Spring to many of the delegates and promoted the upcoming serialization in The New Yorker. Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a long-time environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case and had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides.\nThough Silent Spring had generated a fairly high level of interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became more intense with its serialization, which began in the June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as the American public. Around that time, Carson learned that Silent Spring had been selected as the Book of the Month for October; she said this would \"carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like—much less The New Yorker\". Other publicity included a positive editorial in The New York Times and excerpts of the serialized version were published in Audubon Magazine. There was another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide had broken just before the book's publication, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.\nIn the weeks before the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to Silent Spring from the chemical industry. DuPont, a major manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D, and Velsicol Chemical Company, the only manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor, were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin, and The New Yorker and Audubon Magazine unless their planned Silent Spring features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process Silent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing, which included a pamphlet by William O. Douglas endorsing the book.\nAmerican Cyanamid biochemist Robert White-Stevens and former Cyanamid chemist Thomas Jukes were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT. According to White-Stevens, \"If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth\". Others attacked Carson's personal character and scientific credentials, her training being in marine biology rather than biochemistry. White-Stevens called her \"a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature\". According to historian Linda Lear the former US Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, asked in a letter to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, \"Why a spinster with no children was so concerned about genetics?\" Benson's conclusion was Carson was \"probably a Communist\".\nMonsanto published 5,000 copies of a parody called \"The Desolate Year\" (1962) which projected a world of famine and disease caused by banning pesticides.\nMany critics repeatedly said Carson was calling for the elimination of all pesticides, but she had made it clear she was not advocating this but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on ecosystems. She concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance. Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson \"quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the paradigm of scientific progress that defined postwar American culture\".\nThe academic community—including prominent defenders such as H. J. Muller, Loren Eiseley, Clarence Cottam and Frank Egler—mostly backed the book's scientific claims and public opinion backed Carson's text. The chemical industry campaign was counterproductive because the controversy increased public awareness of the potential dangers of pesticides, an early example of the Streisand Effect. Pesticide use became a major public issue after a CBS Reports television special, The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson, which was broadcast on April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from Silent Spring and interviews with other experts, mostly critics including White-Stevens. According to biographer Linda Lear, \"in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended\". Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide hazards and the public release of a pesticide report by the President's Science Advisory Committee. Within a year of publication, attacks on the book and on Carson had lost momentum.\nIn one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee, which issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims. Following the report's release, Carson also testified before a US Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept most of them because her health was steadily declining, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she could, and appeared on The Today Show and gave speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal from the National Audubon Society, the Cullum Geographical Medal from the American Geographical Society, and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\nOf Carson, Maria Popova wrote, \"Her lyrical writing rendered her not a mere translator of the natural world, but an alchemist transmuting the steel of science into the gold of wonder.\"\n\n\n== Translations ==\nThe book was translated into many languages including German, French, Dutch, Japanese, Russian and Italian.\n\nGerman: Der stumme Frühling, first edition 1963.\nFrench: Printemps silencieux, first edition 1963.\nDutch: Dode lente, first edition 1964 or 1962\nJapanese: 生と死の妙薬, first edition 1964. Successive prints post-2001 titled 沈黙の春\nRussian: Безмолвная весна, first edition 1965.\nSwedish: Tyst vår, first edition 1963.\nChinese: 寂静的春天, first edition 1979.\nItalian: Primavera silenziosa.\nSpanish: Primavera silenciosa.\nDanish: Det Tavse Forår.\nFinnish: Äänetön kevät, first edition 1962, after parts of the book were published in an 8-part article series by the largest subscription newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Helsinki times/news), earlier that year.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Grassroots environmentalism and the EPA ===\nCarson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. Silent Spring became a rallying point for the new social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, \"Silent Spring altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically.\" Carson's work and the activism it inspired are partly responsible for the deep ecology movement and the strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential to the rise of ecofeminism and to many feminist scientists. Carson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States, and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world. The 1967 formation of the Environmental Defense Fund was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to \"establish a citizen's right to a clean environment\", and the arguments against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States, except in emergency cases.\nThe creation of the Environmental Protection Agency by the Nixon Administration in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had written about. Until then, the USDA was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a conflict of interest (COI), since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as \"the extended shadow of Silent Spring\". Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcement of the 1972 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, was directly related to Carson's work. Contrary to the position of the pesticide industry, the DDT phase-out action taken by the EPA (led by William Ruckelshaus) implied that there was no way to adequately regulate DDT use. Ruckelshaus' conclusion was that DDT could not be used safely. History professor Gary Kroll wrote, \"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring played a large role in articulating ecology as a 'subversive subject'—as a perspective that cuts against the grain of materialism, scientism, and the technologically engineered control of nature.\"\nIn a 2013 interview, Ruckelshaus briefly recounted his decision to ban DDT except for emergency uses, noting that Carson's book featured DDT and for that reason the issue drew considerable public attention.\nFormer Vice President of the United States and environmentalist Al Gore wrote an introduction to the 1992 edition of Silent Spring. He wrote: \"Silent Spring had a profound impact ... Indeed, Rachel Carson was one of the reasons that I became so conscious of the environment and so involved with environmental issues  ...  [she] has had as much or more effect on me than any, and perhaps than all of them together.\"\n\n\n=== Debate over environmentalism and DDT restrictions ===\nCarson has been targeted by some organizations opposed to the environmental movement, including Roger Bate of the pro-DDT advocacy group Africa Fighting Malaria and the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI); these sources oppose restrictions on DDT, attribute large numbers of deaths to such restrictions, and argue that Carson was responsible for them. These arguments have been dismissed as \"outrageous\" by former World Health Organization scientist Socrates Litsios. May Berenbaum, University of Illinois entomologist, says, \"to blame environmentalists who oppose DDT for more deaths than Hitler is worse than irresponsible\". Investigative journalist Adam Sarvana and others characterize this notion as a \"myth\" promoted principally by Bate.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, campaigns against the book intensified, in part due to efforts by the tobacco industry to cast larger doubt on science-driven policy as a way of contesting bans on smoking. In 2009, the heavily corporate-funded CEI set up a website falsely blaming Carson for deaths to malaria. This triggered a point-by-point rebuttal by biographer William Souder, who reviewed the distortions used by campaigners against Silent Spring.\nA 2012 review article in Nature by Rob Dunn commemorating the 50th anniversary of Silent Spring and summarizing the progressive environmental-policy changes made since then, prompted a response in a letter written by Anthony Trewavas and co-signed by 10 others, including Christopher Leaver, Bruce Ames and Peter Lachmann, who quote estimates of 60 to 80 million deaths \"as a result of misguided fears based on poorly understood evidence\".\nBiographer Hamilton Lytle believes these estimates are unrealistic, even if Carson can be \"blamed\" for worldwide DDT policies. John Quiggin and Tim Lambert wrote, \"the most striking feature of the claim against Carson is the ease with which it can be refuted\". DDT was never banned for anti-malarial use, and its ban for agricultural use in the United States in 1972 did not apply outside the US nor to anti-malaria spraying. The international treaty that banned most uses of DDT and other organochlorine pesticides—the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (which became effective in 2004)—included an exemption for the use of DDT for malaria control until affordable substitutes could be found. Mass outdoor spraying of DDT was abandoned in poor countries subject to malaria, such as Sri Lanka, in the 1970s and 1980s; this was not because of government prohibitions but because the DDT had lost its ability to kill the mosquitoes. Because of insects' very short breeding cycle and large number of offspring, the most resistant insects survive and pass on their genetic traits to their offspring, which replace the pesticide-slain insects relatively rapidly. Agricultural spraying of pesticides produces pesticide resistance in seven to ten years.\nSome experts have said that restrictions placed on the agricultural use of DDT have increased its effectiveness for malaria control. According to pro-DDT advocate Amir Attaran, the result of the (activated in 2004) Stockholm Convention banning DDT's use in agriculture \"is arguably better than the status quo ... For the first time, there is now an insecticide which is restricted to vector control only, meaning that the selection of resistant mosquitoes will be slower than before.\"\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nSilent Spring has been featured in many lists of the best nonfiction books of the twentieth century. It was fifth in the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Nonfiction and number 78 in the National Review's 100 best non-fiction books of the 20th century. In 2006, Silent Spring was named one of the 25 greatest science books of all time by the editors of Discover Magazine. In 2012, the American Chemical Society designated the legacy of Silent Spring a National Historic Chemical Landmark at Chatham University in Pittsburgh.\nIn 1996, a follow-up book, Beyond Silent Spring, co-written by H. F. van Emden and David Peakall, was published.\nIn 1967, George Newson composed the tape composition Silent Spring using birdsong recorded at London Zoo as source material. It was premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in January 1968.\nSilent Spring is mentioned in the 2008 science fiction novel The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin, as well as its Tencent 2023 and Netflix 2024 television series adaptations.\nIn 2011, the American composer Steven Stucky wrote the eponymously titled symphonic poem Silent Spring to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the book's publication. The piece was given its world premiere in Pittsburgh on February 17, 2012, with the conductor Manfred Honeck leading the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.\nNaturalist David Attenborough has stated that Silent Spring was probably the book that had changed the scientific world the most, after the On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources and further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSilent Spring at Faded Page (Canada)\nThe New York Times July 22, 1962 report of chemical industry's campaign against the 16 Archived July 3, 2014, at the Wayback Machine, 23 Archived May 27, 2014, at the Wayback Machine, 30 Archived May 27, 2014, at the Wayback Machine June 1962 serial in The New Yorker\nNew York Times book review September 23, 1962\nGraham, Frank Jr.; Since Silent Spring: rebuttal to the attack by chemical-agribusiness companies Archived April 17, 2014, at the Wayback Machine; Audubon Magazine\nDoyle, Jack “Power in the Pen”: Silent Spring: 1962 (Publishing, Politics, Ecology) pophistorydig.com\nNatural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): The Story of Silent Spring – NRDC\nPhotos of the first edition of Silent Spring\nSilent Spring, A Visual History curated by the Michigan State University Museum\nRachel Carson's Silent Spring Turns 50 – Elizabeth Grossman – The Atlantic\nGriswold, Eliza; How Silent Spring Ignited the Environmental Movement The New York Times September 21, 2012\nThe Rachel Carson Council",

Carson initially planned to call the sequel Return to the Sea, and began writing in 1948, just after hiring Marie Rodell as her literary agent. Carson began by writing a single chapter (what would be \"The Birth of an Island\") along with a detailed outline, which Rodell used to pitch the book to publishers. During research for the book, Carson met with a number of oceanographers to discuss current research. Carson and Rodell had little initial success with magazines as outlets for the islands chapter, nor for a second chapter titled \"Another Beachhead.\"  In April 1949, with about a third of the chapters complete, Rodell began trying to find a publisher for the entire book. By June she had arranged a contract with Oxford University Press that promised completion of the manuscript by March 1, 1950. Carson continued to write and research through 1949 and into 1950, despite unexpected health and financial difficulties. In part the research involved a trip aboard a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ship, Albatross III. After revising the completion date, Carson completed the manuscript in June 1950. By that time, several periodicals (The New Yorker, Science Digest, and The Yale Review) were interested in publishing some of the chapters.\n\nNine of fourteen chapters were serialized in The New Yorker beginning on June 2, 1951, and the book was published on July 2 by Oxford University Press. The serialization created a very large popular response, and the book was the subject of the feature review in The New York Times Book Review the day before publication. One chapter (\"The Birth of an Island\") was published in The Yale Review; it won the George Westinghouse Science Writing prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAfter the book's release, Carson was inundated with an unexpected volume of fan mail and media attention. She was soon the object of attention from \"the literary crowd,\" and because of a subsequent condensation in Reader's Digest, a broad general audience as well. The book sold more than 250,000 copies in 1951, in addition to the condensation and excerpts published elsewhere.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nA film version was filmed in 1952 and released in 1953; it won the 1953 Oscar for Best Documentary (though Carson was extremely disappointed with the script and would never sell film rights to her work again).\n\n\n== See also ==\nSea Around Us Project\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\nLear, Linda.

Kuhn called the core concepts of an ascendant revolution its \"paradigms\" and thereby launched this word into widespread analogical use in the second half of the 20th century. Kuhn's insistence that a paradigm shift was a mélange of sociology, enthusiasm and scientific promise, but not a logically determinate procedure, caused an uproar in reaction to his work. Kuhn addressed concerns in the 1969 postscript to the second edition. For some commentators The Structure of Scientific Revolutions introduced a realistic humanism into the core of science, while for others the nobility of science was tarnished by Kuhn's introduction of an irrational element into the heart of its greatest achievements.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions was first published as a monograph in the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, then as a book by University of Chicago Press in 1962. In 1969, Kuhn added a postscript to the book in which he replied to critical responses to the first edition. A 50th Anniversary Edition (with an introductory essay by Ian Hacking) was published by the University of Chicago Press in April 2012.\nKuhn dated the genesis of his book to 1947, when he was a graduate student at Harvard University and had been asked to teach a science class for humanities undergraduates with a focus on historical case studies. Kuhn later commented that until then, \"I'd never read an old document in science.\" Aristotle's Physics was astonishingly unlike Isaac Newton's work in its concepts of matter and motion. Kuhn wrote: \"as I was reading him, Aristotle appeared not only ignorant of mechanics, but a dreadfully bad physical scientist as well. About motion, in particular, his writings seemed to me full of egregious errors, both of logic and of observation.\" This was in an apparent contradiction with the fact that Aristotle was a brilliant mind. While perusing Aristotle's Physics, Kuhn formed the view that in order to properly appreciate Aristotle's reasoning, one must be aware of the scientific conventions of the time. Kuhn concluded that Aristotle's concepts were not \"bad Newton,\" just different. This insight was the foundation of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.\nCentral ideas regarding the process of scientific investigation and discovery had been anticipated by Ludwik Fleck in Fleck (1935). Fleck had developed the first system of the sociology of scientific knowledge. He claimed that the exchange of ideas led to the establishment of a thought collective, which, when developed sufficiently, separated the field into esoteric (professional) and exoteric (laymen) circles. Kuhn wrote the foreword to the 1979 edition of Fleck's book, noting that he read it in 1950 and was reassured that someone \"saw in the history of science what I myself was finding there.\"\nKuhn was not confident about how his book would be received. Harvard University had denied his tenure a few years prior. By the mid-1980s, however, his book had achieved blockbuster status. When Kuhn's book came out in the early 1960s, \"structure\" was an intellectually popular word in many fields in the humanities and social sciences, including linguistics and anthropology, appealing in its idea that complex phenomena could reveal or be studied through basic, simpler structures. Kuhn's book contributed to that idea.\nOne theory to which Kuhn replies directly is Karl Popper's \"falsificationism,\" which stresses falsifiability as the most important criterion for distinguishing between that which is scientific and that which is unscientific. Kuhn also addresses verificationism, a philosophical movement that emerged in the 1920s among logical positivists. The verifiability principle claims that meaningful statements must be supported by empirical evidence or logical requirements.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n=== Basic approach ===\nKuhn's approach to the history and philosophy of science addresses conceptual issues like the practice of normal science, influence of historical events, emergence of scientific discoveries, nature of scientific revolutions and progress through scientific revolutions. What sorts of intellectual options and strategies were available to people during a given period? What types of lexicons and terminology were known and employed during certain epochs? Stressing the importance of not attributing traditional thought to earlier investigators, Kuhn's book argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and possibilities.\nKuhn did not see scientific theory as proceeding linearly from an objective, unbiased accumulation of all available data, but rather as paradigm-driven:\n\n\"The operations and measurements that a scientist undertakes in the laboratory are not \"the given\" of experience but rather \"the collected with difficulty\". They are not what the scientist sees—at least not before his research is well advanced and his attention focused. Rather, they are concrete indices to the content of more elementary perceptions, and as such they are selected for the close scrutiny of normal research only because they promise opportunity for the fruitful elaboration of an accepted paradigm. Far more clearly than the immediate experience from which they in part derive, operations and measurements are paradigm-determined. Science does not deal in all possible laboratory manipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a paradigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has partially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms engage in different concrete laboratory manipulations.\"\n\n\n=== Historical examples of chemistry ===\n\nKuhn explains his ideas using examples taken from the history of science. For instance, eighteenth-century scientists believed that homogenous solutions were chemical compounds.  Therefore, a combination of water and alcohol was generally classified as a compound. Nowadays it is considered to be a solution, but there was no reason then to suspect that it was not a compound. Water and alcohol would not separate spontaneously, nor will they separate completely upon distillation (they form an azeotrope). Water and alcohol can be combined in any proportion.\nUnder this paradigm, scientists believed that chemical reactions (such as the combination of water and alcohol) did not necessarily occur in fixed proportion. This belief was ultimately overturned by Dalton's atomic theory, which asserted that atoms can only combine in simple, whole-number ratios. Under this new paradigm, any reaction which did not occur in fixed proportion could not be a chemical process. This type of world-view transition among the scientific community exemplifies Kuhn's paradigm shift.\n\n\n=== Examples from applied microbiology ===\nIn 1860 Louis Pasteur published experimental results proving that fermentation was caused by microorganisms, instead of some self-starting chemical reaction, which was the reigning theory. As summarized by science writer Charles Mann, \"Pasteur’s work led to a pitched intellectual battle—and the eventual triumph of germ theory, which overturned earlier ideas about infectious disease.\" Mann continues:\nPasteur’s work on the role of microorganisms in infectious disease inaugurated the modern discipline of microbiology—and led to a host of about-faces in previous medical beliefs. German researcher Robert Koch, often considered microbiology’s co-founder, then discovered the microbes that caused anthrax, cholera and tuberculosis. All cast aside earlier ideas. For instance, many in Koch’s Germany believed tuberculosis was a hereditary disease passed down through families until 1882, when the scientist unveiled Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for the disease.\nWhile paradigm shifts in the physical and chemical sciences can greatly affect how technologies evolve in societally impactful ways, anything pertaining to the wellbeing of human bodies can easily become politicized. Mann offers examples pertaining to the decades long controversy over the age threshold recommended for regular breast cancer screenings and to the initial World Health Organization pronouncement in 2020 that COVID-19 could not be transmitted through the air. Government policies and mandates issued to thwart the COVID-19 pandemic were in part impelled by scientific understandings that were later overturned.\n\n\n=== Copernican Revolution ===\n\nA famous example of a revolution in scientific thought is the Copernican Revolution. In Ptolemy's school of thought, cycles and epicycles (with some additional concepts) were used for modeling the movements of the planets in a cosmos that had a stationary Earth at its center. As accuracy of celestial observations increased, complexity of the Ptolemaic cyclical and epicyclical mechanisms had to increase to maintain the calculated planetary positions close to the observed positions. Copernicus proposed a cosmology in which the Sun was at the center and the Earth was one of the planets revolving around it. For modeling the planetary motions, Copernicus used the tools he was familiar with, namely the cycles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic toolbox. Yet Copernicus' model needed more cycles and epicycles than existed in the then-current Ptolemaic model, and due to a lack of accuracy in calculations, his model did not appear to provide more accurate predictions than the Ptolemy model. Copernicus' contemporaries rejected his cosmology, and Kuhn asserts that they were quite right to do so: Copernicus' cosmology lacked credibility.\nKuhn illustrates how a paradigm shift later became possible when Galileo Galilei introduced his new ideas concerning motion. Intuitively, when an object is set in motion, it soon comes to a halt. A well-made cart may travel a long distance before it stops, but unless something keeps pushing it, it will eventually stop moving. Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of nature: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed. Given the knowledge available at the time, this represented sensible, reasonable thinking.\nGalileo put forward a bold alternative conjecture: suppose, he said, that we always observe objects coming to a halt simply because some friction is always occurring. Galileo had no equipment with which to objectively confirm his conjecture, but he suggested that without any friction to slow down an object in motion, its inherent tendency is to maintain its speed without the application of any additional force.\nThe Ptolemaic approach of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: there seemed to be no end to the mushrooming growth in complexity required to account for the observable phenomena. Johannes Kepler was the first person to abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.\nGalileo's conjecture was merely that – a conjecture. So was Kepler's cosmology. But each conjecture increased the credibility of the other, and together, they changed the prevailing perceptions of the scientific community. Later, Newton showed that Kepler's three laws could all be derived from a single theory of motion and planetary motion. Newton solidified and unified the paradigm shift that Galileo and Kepler had initiated.\n\n\n=== Coherence ===\nOne of the aims of science is to find models that will account for as many observations as possible within a coherent framework. Together, Galileo's rethinking of the nature of motion and Keplerian cosmology represented a coherent framework that was capable of rivaling the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic framework.\nOnce a paradigm shift has taken place, the textbooks are rewritten. Often the history of science too is rewritten, being presented as an inevitable process leading up to the current, established framework of thought. There is a prevalent belief that all hitherto-unexplained phenomena will in due course be accounted for in terms of this established framework. Kuhn states that scientists spend most (if not all) of their careers in a process of puzzle-solving. Their puzzle-solving is pursued with great tenacity, because the previous successes of the established paradigm tend to generate great confidence that the approach being taken guarantees that a solution to the puzzle exists, even though it may be very hard to find. Kuhn calls this process normal science.\nAs a paradigm is stretched to its limits, anomalies – failures of the current paradigm to take into account observed phenomena – accumulate. Their significance is judged by the practitioners of the discipline. Some anomalies may be dismissed as errors in observation, others as merely requiring small adjustments to the current paradigm that will be clarified in due course. Some anomalies resolve themselves spontaneously, having increased the available depth of insight along the way. But no matter how great or numerous the anomalies that persist, Kuhn observes, the practicing scientists will not lose faith in the established paradigm until a credible alternative is available; to lose faith in the solvability of the problems would in effect mean ceasing to be a scientist.\nIn any community of scientists, Kuhn states, there are some individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a crisis exists, embark on what Kuhn calls revolutionary science, exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear to be accompanied by numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. Kuhn cites, as an example, that Alexis Clairaut, in 1750, was able to account accurately for the precession of the Moon's orbit using Newtonian theory, after sixty years of failed attempts.  It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new paradigm will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging paradigm is solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a paradigm shift will have occurred.\nKuhn uses Norwood Russell Hanson's concept of 'theory-ladenness' to explain paradigm shifts. It shows that scientists may interpret the same phenomenon differently depending on the prevailing theory, and it reveals how perspectives on existing data change when a new paradigm emerges.\n\n\n=== Phases ===\nKuhn explains the process of scientific change as the result of various phases of paradigm change.\n\nPhase 1 – It exists only once and is the pre-paradigm phase, in which there is no consensus on any particular theory. This phase is characterized by several incompatible and incomplete theories. Consequently, most scientific inquiry takes the form of lengthy books, as there is no common body of facts that may be taken for granted.  When the actors in the pre-paradigm community eventually gravitate to one of these conceptual frameworks and ultimately to a widespread consensus on the appropriate choice of methods, terminology and on the kinds of experiment that are likely to contribute to increased insights, the old schools of thought disappear. The new paradigm leads to a more rigid definition of the research field, and those who are reluctant or unable to adapt are isolated or have to join rival groups.\nPhase 2 – Normal science begins, in which puzzles are solved within the context of the dominant paradigm. As long as there is consensus within the discipline, normal science continues. Over time, progress in normal science may reveal anomalies, facts that are difficult to explain within the context of the existing paradigm. While usually these anomalies are resolved, in some cases they may accumulate to the point where normal science becomes difficult and where weaknesses in the old paradigm are revealed.\nPhase 3 – If the paradigm proves chronically unable to account for anomalies, the community enters a crisis period. Crises are often resolved within the context of normal science. However, after significant efforts of normal science within a paradigm fail, science may enter the next phase.\nPhase 4 – Paradigm shift, or scientific revolution, is the phase in which the underlying assumptions of the field are reexamined and a new paradigm is established.\nPhase 5 – Post-revolution, the new paradigm's dominance is established and so scientists return to normal science, solving puzzles within the new paradigm.\nA science may go through these cycles repeatedly, though Kuhn notes that it is a good thing for science that such shifts do not occur often or easily.\n\n\n=== Incommensurability ===\nAccording to Kuhn, the scientific paradigms preceding and succeeding a paradigm shift are so different that their theories are incommensurable—the new paradigm cannot be proven or disproven by the rules of the old paradigm, and vice versa. A later interpretation by Kuhn of \"commensurable\" versus \"incommensurable\" was as a distinction between \"languages\", namely, that statements in commensurable languages were translatable fully from one to the other, while in incommensurable languages, strict translation is not possible. The paradigm shift does not merely involve the revision or transformation of an individual theory, it changes the way terminology is defined, how the scientists in that field view their subject, and, perhaps most significantly, what questions are regarded as valid, and what rules are used to determine the truth of a particular theory. The new theories were not, as the scientists had previously thought, just extensions of old theories, but were instead completely new world views.\nSuch incommensurability exists not just before and after a paradigm shift, but in the periods in between conflicting paradigms. It is simply not possible, according to Kuhn, to construct an impartial language that can be used to perform a neutral comparison between conflicting paradigms, because the very terms used are integral to the respective paradigms, and therefore have different connotations in each paradigm. The advocates of mutually exclusive paradigms are in a difficult position: \"Though each may hope to convert the other to his way of seeing science and its problems, neither may hope to prove his case. The competition between paradigms is not the sort of battle that can be resolved by proofs.\" Scientists subscribing to different paradigms end up talking past one another.\nKuhn states that the probabilistic tools used by verificationists are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to falsify a statement will fall under one of the paradigms they are supposed to help compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of falsifiability is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed as it has. In the practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, the textbooks will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.\nKuhn further developed his ideas regarding incommensurability in the 1980s and 1990s. In his unpublished manuscript The Plurality of Worlds, Kuhn introduces the theory of kind concepts: sets of interrelated concepts that are characteristic of a time period in a science and differ in structure from the modern analogous kind concepts. These different structures imply different \"taxonomies\" of things and processes, and this difference in taxonomies constitutes incommensurability. This theory is strongly naturalistic and draws on developmental psychology to \"found a quasi-transcendental theory of experience and of reality.\"\n\n\n=== Exemplar ===\nKuhn introduced the concept of an exemplar in a postscript to the second edition of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1970). He noted that he was substituting the term \"exemplars\" for \"paradigm\", meaning the problems and solutions that students of a subject learn from the beginning of their education. For example, physicists might have as exemplars the inclined plane, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, or instruments like the calorimeter.\nAccording to Kuhn, scientific practice alternates between periods of normal science and revolutionary science. During periods of normalcy, scientists tend to subscribe to a large body of interconnecting knowledge, methods, and assumptions which make up the reigning paradigm (see paradigm shift). Normal science presents a series of problems that are solved as scientists explore their field. The solutions to some of these problems become well known and are the exemplars of the field.\nThose who study a scientific discipline are expected to know its exemplars. There is no fixed set of exemplars, but for a physicist today it would probably include the harmonic oscillator from mechanics and the hydrogen atom from quantum mechanics.\n\n\n== Kuhn on scientific progress ==\nThe first edition of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions ended with a chapter titled \"Progress through Revolutions\", in which Kuhn spelled out his views on the nature of scientific progress. Since he considered problem solving (or \"puzzle solving\") to be a central element of science, Kuhn saw that for a new candidate paradigm to be accepted by a scientific community,\n\n\"First, the new candidate must seem to resolve some outstanding and generally recognized problem that can be met in no other way. Second, the new paradigm must promise to preserve a relatively large part of the concrete problem-solving ability that has accrued to science through its predecessors. Novelty for its own sake is not a desideratum in the sciences as it is in so many other creative fields. As a result, though new paradigms seldom or never possess all the capabilities of their predecessors, they usually preserve a great deal of the most concrete parts of past achievement and they always permit additional concrete problem-solutions besides.\"\nIn the second edition, Kuhn added a postscript in which he elaborated his ideas on the nature of scientific progress. He described a thought experiment involving an observer who has the opportunity to inspect an assortment of theories, each corresponding to a single stage in a succession of theories. What if the observer is presented with these theories without any explicit indication of their chronological order? Kuhn anticipates that it will be possible to reconstruct their chronology on the basis of the theories' scope and content, because the more recent a theory is, the better it will be as an instrument for solving the kinds of puzzle that scientists aim to solve. Kuhn remarked: \"That is not a relativist's position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress.\"\n\n\n== Influence and reception ==\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions has been credited with producing the kind of \"paradigm shift\" Kuhn discussed. Since the book's publication, over one million copies have been sold, including translations into sixteen different languages. In 1987, it was reported to be the twentieth-century book most frequently cited in the period 1976–1983 in the arts and the humanities.\n\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nThe first extensive review of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was authored by Dudley Shapere, a philosopher who interpreted Kuhn's work as a continuation of the anti-positivist sentiment of other philosophers of science, including Paul Feyerabend and Norwood Russell Hanson. Shapere noted the book's influence on the philosophical landscape of the time, calling it \"a sustained attack on the prevailing image of scientific change as a linear process of ever-increasing knowledge\". According to the philosopher Michael Ruse, Kuhn discredited the ahistorical and prescriptive approach to the philosophy of science of Ernest Nagel's The Structure of Science (1961). Kuhn's book sparked a historicist \"revolt against positivism\" (the so-called \"historical turn in philosophy of science\" which looked to the history of science as a source of data for developing a philosophy of science), although this may not have been Kuhn's intention; in fact, he had already approached the prominent positivist Rudolf Carnap about having his work published in the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science. The philosopher Robert C. Solomon noted that Kuhn's views have often been suggested to have an affinity to those of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Kuhn's view of scientific knowledge, as expounded in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, has been compared to the views of the philosopher Michel Foucault.\n\n\n=== Sociology ===\nThe first field to claim descent from Kuhn's ideas was the sociology of scientific knowledge. Sociologists working within this new field, including Harry Collins and Steven Shapin, used Kuhn's emphasis on the role of non-evidential community factors in scientific development to argue against logical empiricism, which discouraged inquiry into the social aspects of scientific communities. These sociologists expanded upon Kuhn's ideas, arguing that scientific judgment is determined by social factors, such as professional interests and political ideologies.\nBarry Barnes detailed the connection between the sociology of scientific knowledge and Kuhn in his book T. S. Kuhn and Social Science. In particular, Kuhn's ideas regarding science occurring within an established framework informed Barnes's own ideas regarding finitism, a theory wherein meaning is continuously changed (even during periods of normal science) by its usage within the social framework.\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions elicited a number of reactions from the broader sociological community. Following the book's publication, some sociologists expressed the belief that the field of sociology had not yet developed a unifying paradigm, and should therefore strive towards homogenization. Others argued that the field was in the midst of normal science, and speculated that a new revolution would soon emerge. Some sociologists, including John Urry, doubted that Kuhn's theory, which addressed the development of natural science, was necessarily relevant to sociological development.\n\n\n=== Economics ===\nDevelopments in the field of economics are often expressed and legitimized in Kuhnian terms. For instance, neoclassical economists have claimed \"to be at the second stage [normal science], and to have been there for a very long time – since Adam Smith, according to some accounts (Hollander, 1987), or Jevons according to others (Hutchison, 1978)\". In the 1970s, post-Keynesian economists denied the coherence of the neoclassical paradigm, claiming that their own paradigm would ultimately become dominant.\nWhile perhaps less explicit, Kuhn's influence remains apparent in recent economics. For instance, the abstract of Olivier Blanchard's paper \"The State of Macro\" (2008) begins:\n\nFor a long while after the explosion of macroeconomics in the 1970s, the field looked like a battlefield. Over time however, largely because facts do not go away, a largely shared vision both of fluctuations and of methodology has emerged. Not everything is fine. Like all revolutions, this one has come with the destruction of some knowledge, and suffers from extremism and herding.\n\n\n=== Political science ===\nIn 1974, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was ranked as the second most frequently used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods. In particular, Kuhn's theory has been used by political scientists to critique behavioralism, which claims that accurate political statements must be both testable and falsifiable. The book also proved popular with political scientists embroiled in debates about whether a set of formulations put forth by a political scientist constituted a theory, or something else.\nThe changes that occur in politics, society and business are often expressed in Kuhnian terms, however poor their parallel with the practice of science may seem to scientists and historians of science. The terms \"paradigm\" and \"paradigm shift\" have become such notorious clichés and buzzwords that they are sometimes viewed as effectively devoid of content.\n\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions was soon criticized by Kuhn's colleagues in the history and philosophy of science. In 1965, a special symposium on the book was held at an International Colloquium on the Philosophy of Science that took place at Bedford College, London, and was chaired by Karl Popper. The symposium led to the publication of the symposium's presentations plus other essays, most of them critical, which eventually appeared in an influential volume of essays. Kuhn expressed the opinion that his critics' readings of his book were so inconsistent with his own understanding of it that he was \"tempted to posit the existence of two Thomas Kuhns,\" one the author of his book, the other the individual who had been criticized in the symposium by Professors Popper, Feyerabend, Lakatos, Toulmin and Watkins.\nA number of the included essays question the existence of normal science. In his essay, Feyerabend suggests that Kuhn's conception of normal science fits organized crime as well as it does science. Popper expresses distaste with the entire premise of Kuhn's book, writing, \"the idea of turning for enlightenment concerning the aims of science, and its possible progress, to sociology or to psychology (or ... to the history of science) is surprising and disappointing.\"\n\n\n=== Concept of paradigm ===\nStephen Toulmin defined paradigm as \"the set of common beliefs and agreements shared between scientists about how problems should be understood and addressed\". In his 1972 work, Human Understanding, he argued that a more realistic picture of science than that presented in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions would admit the fact that revisions in science take place much more frequently, and are much less dramatic than can be explained by the model of revolution/normal science. In Toulmin's view, such revisions occur quite often during periods of what Kuhn would call \"normal science\". For Kuhn to explain such revisions in terms of the non-paradigmatic puzzle solutions of normal science, he would need to delineate what is perhaps an implausibly sharp distinction between paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic science.\nOne of the early critics of Kuhn,  Norwood Russell Hanson, criticized Kuhn's paradigm shift theory as conceptually circular and therefore unfalsifiable.\n\n\n=== Incommensurability of paradigms ===\nIn a series of texts published in the early 1970s, Carl R. Kordig asserted a position somewhere between that of Kuhn and the older philosophy of science. His criticism of the Kuhnian position was that the incommensurability thesis was too radical, and that this made it impossible to explain the confrontation of scientific theories that actually occurs. According to Kordig, it is in fact possible to admit the existence of revolutions and paradigm shifts in science while still recognizing that theories belonging to different paradigms can be compared and confronted on the plane of observation. Those who accept the incommensurability thesis do not do so because they admit the discontinuity of paradigms, but because they attribute a radical change in meanings to such shifts.\nKordig maintains that there is a common observational plane. For example, when Kepler and Tycho Brahe are trying to explain the relative variation of the distance of the Sun from the horizon at sunrise, both see the same thing (the same configuration is focused on the retina of each individual). This is just one example of the fact that \"rival scientific theories share some observations, and therefore some meanings\". Kordig suggests that with this approach, he is not reintroducing the distinction between observations and theory in which the former is assigned a privileged and neutral status, but that it is possible to affirm more simply the fact that, even if no sharp distinction exists between theory and observations, this does not imply that there are no comprehensible differences at the two extremes of this polarity.\nAt a secondary level, for Kordig there is a common plane of inter-paradigmatic standards or shared norms that permit the effective confrontation of rival theories.\nIn 1973, Hartry Field published an article that also sharply criticized Kuhn's idea of incommensurability. In particular, he took issue with this passage from Kuhn:\n\n\"Newtonian mass is immutably conserved; that of Einstein is convertible into energy. Only at very low relative velocities can the two masses be measured in the same way, and even then they must not be conceived as if they were the same thing.\"\nField takes this idea of incommensurability between the same terms in different theories one step further. Instead of attempting to identify a persistence of the reference of terms in different theories, Field's analysis emphasizes the indeterminacy of reference within individual theories. Field takes the example of the term \"mass\", and asks what exactly \"mass\" means in modern post-relativistic physics. He finds that there are at least two different definitions:\n\nRelativistic mass: the mass of a particle is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by the speed of light squared. Since the total energy of a particle in relation to one system of reference differs from the total energy in relation to other systems of reference, while the speed of light remains constant in all systems, it follows that the mass of a particle has different values in different systems of reference.\n\"Real\" mass: the mass of a particle is equal to the non-kinetic energy of a particle divided by the speed of light squared. Since non-kinetic energy is the same in all systems of reference, and the same is true of light, it follows that the mass of a particle has the same value in all systems of reference.\nProjecting this distinction backwards in time onto Newtonian dynamics, we can formulate the following two hypotheses:\n\nHR: the term \"mass\" in Newtonian theory denotes relativistic mass.\nHp: the term \"mass\" in Newtonian theory denotes \"real\" mass.\nAccording to Field, it is impossible to decide which of these two affirmations is true. Prior to the theory of relativity, the term \"mass\" was referentially indeterminate. But this does not mean that the term \"mass\" did not have a different meaning than it now has. The problem is not one of meaning but of reference. The reference of such terms as mass is only partially determined: we do not really know how Newton intended his use of this term to be applied. As a consequence, neither of the two terms fully denotes (refers). It follows that it is improper to maintain that a term has changed its reference during a scientific revolution; it is more appropriate to describe terms such as \"mass\" as \"having undergone a denotional refinement\".\nIn 1973, Donald Davidson objected that the concept of incommensurable scientific paradigms competing with each other is logically inconsistent. In his article Davidson goes well beyond the semantic version of the incommensurability thesis: to make sense of the idea of a language independent of translation requires a distinction between conceptual schemes and the content organized by such schemes. But, Davidson argues, no coherent sense can be made of the idea of a conceptual scheme, and therefore no sense may be attached to the idea of an untranslatable language.\n\n\n=== Incommensurability and perception ===\nThe close connection between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs is at the root of the notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn maintained that the perception of the world depends on how the percipient conceives the world: two scientists who witness the same phenomenon and are steeped in two radically different theories will see two different things. According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines what we see.\nJerry Fodor attempts to establish that this theoretical paradigm is fallacious and misleading by demonstrating the impenetrability of perception to the background knowledge of subjects. The strongest case can be based on evidence from experimental cognitive psychology, namely the persistence of perceptual illusions. Knowing that the lines in the Müller-Lyer illusion are equal does not prevent one from continuing to see one line as being longer than the other. This impenetrability of the information elaborated by the mental modules limits the scope of interpretationalism.\nIn epistemology, for example, the criticism of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then it is possible to maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they interpret it differently. The point is that it is necessary to distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.\nOther critics, such as Israel Scheffler, Hilary Putnam and Saul Kripke, have focused on the Fregean distinction between sense and reference in order to defend scientific realism. Scheffler contends that Kuhn confuses the meanings of terms such as \"mass\" with their referents. While their meanings may very well differ, their referents (the objects or entities to which they correspond in the external world) remain fixed.\n\n\n== Subsequent commentary by Kuhn ==\nIn 1995 Kuhn argued that the Darwinian metaphor in the book should have been taken more seriously than it had been.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1998 Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction: The Board's List (69)\n1999 National Review 100 Best Nonfiction Books of the Century (25)\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nKuhn, Thomas S.

Wilson Prize for Literary Science Writing Nominee for Longlist\n2017: Phi Beta Kappa Society Book Award in Science\n\n\n== PBS documentary ==\nA documentary has been produced by Ken Burns with the same title The Gene: An Intimate History in 2020. Siddhartha Mukherjee served as a key commentator in the said documentary.\n\n\n=== Episode 1 ===\nIn 2014, He Jiankui had intentionally altered the gene in the embryo of twin girls in the People's Republic of China. David Baltimore pontificates that it wasn't \"medically necessary.\" Francis Collins says it would have been illegal in the United States.\nKIF1A is a gene that make motor protein in the body.\nThe idea that in each sperm or egg is a tiny person is known as pre-formationism. Theodor Boveri was an early biologist studying chromosomes in 1900s. Later, Danish researcher Wilhelm Johannsen called the sites of heredity on chromosomes \"genes.\"\nThomas Morgan discovers that some traits are linked in fruit flies.\nDavid Botstein sought to trace the gene causing Huntington's disease.  Genetic markers allow us to track genes. Eventually, biologists found the CAG chemical phrase on human Chromosome 4 responsible for Huntington's disease.\nIn 1971, Paul Berg conducted experiments in which he used \"bacterial scissors.\"\nIn 1975, the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA was held to discuss the implications of preventing and curing genetic diseases. One interviewee in the 1970s wondered if recombinant DNA experiments could produce \"Frankensteins.\"\nVenture capitalist Bob Swanson meets with Herbert Boyer in the 1970s to lay out his vision for Genentech. Their first drug would be insulin to help diabetic people.\n\n\n=== Episode 2 ===\nBy the 1980s, scientists had only uncovered about 100 actual genes. In 1986, hundreds of biologists convene at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in Long Island, New York, to discuss a plan to read out the entire human genome. In the late 1970s, Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert had pioneered DNA sequencing.\nBernadine Healy was the NIH director at the inception of the Human Genome Project.\nFrançois Jacob and Jacques Monod were working in Paris in the 1950s and 1960s; their goal was to understand transcription (going from DNA to RNA).\nSMN2 is a gene that when mutated can cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\nAlthough some genetic diseases are caused by defect in a single gene, Richard Klausner points out that the situation gets complicated because some diseases are caused by defects in many genes. David B. Goldstein (geneticist) says that there are over 100 genes that increase the risk of schizophrenia.\nIn 2013, Lettie Lassiter was diagnosed with stage 4 gallbladder cancer. Later, this cancer spreads to her brain!\nNusinersen is a medication used in treating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\nJesse Gelsinger who was going to die because of a liver disease known as OTC (Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency) agreed to receive gene therapy from James Wilson. The therapy didn't succeed and Gelsinger died anyway.\nEric Lander explain that bacteria can edit DNA.\nCRISPR is like a \"biometric identification system\" according to Samuel H. Sternberg. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna have collaborated on CRISPR work.\nA dwarf mother has a \"precarious feeling\" that CRISPR may be used to produce children with normal heights; she prefers having dwarf children like she is.\nHe Jiankui has been vilified for editing the genes of Lulu and Nana to give them protection against HIV. He Jiankui, who is interviewed in this documentary, vouches that his sole objective \"was to prevent HIV infection. The girls are safe, healthy.\" He had performed pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). His competitor peers had hostile questions for He at a conference. Aside from He's Chinese peers, Eric Lander calls He's breakthrough \"unethical.\"\n\n\n=== Cast ===\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nBryan Appleyard of The Sunday Times called it \"Dramatic and precise... thrilling and comprehensive account of what seems certain to be the most radical, controversial and, to borrow from the subtitle, intimate science of our time. He is a natural storyteller... A page-turner... Read this book and steel yourself for what comes next.\"\nAndrew Solomon wrote in the Washington Post: \"With a marriage of architectural precision and luscious narrative, an eye for both the paradoxical detail and the unsettling irony, and a genius for locating the emotional truths buried in chemical abstractions, Mukherjee leaves you feeling as though you’ve just aced a college course for which you’d been afraid to register – and enjoyed every minute of it.\"\n\n\n== Criticism and response ==\nIn his 2016 article 'Same but different', an excerpt from the chapter \"The First Derivative of Identity\" of this book, in The New Yorker, he attributed the most important genetic functions to epigenetic factors (such as histone modification and DNA methylation).\"Chance events—injuries, infections, infatuations; the haunting trill of that particular nocturne—impinge on one twin and not on the other. Genes are turned on and off in response to these events, as epigenetic marks are gradually layered above genes, etching the genome with its own scars, calluses, and freckles.\"This analogy based on his mother and her twin sister, who have distinct personalities, was critiqued by geneticists such as Mark Ptashne, at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and John Greally, at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, because of over emphasis on histone modification and DNA methylation, when they really are only minor contributors. Steven Henikoff, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, opined that, \"Mukherjee seemed not to realize that transcription factors occupy the top of the hierarchy of epigenetic information... histone modifications at most act as cogs in the machinery.\" In response, Mukherjee did admit \"he now realizes that he erred by omitting key areas of the science, but that he didn’t mean to mislead. 'I sincerely thought that I had done it justice.' \"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKen Burns presents The Gene: An Intimate History\n\"Siddhartha Mukherjee: The Gene\". YouTube.

It won two Emmys and a Peabody Award, and has since been broadcast in more than 60 countries and seen by over 500 million people. A book was also published to accompany the series.\nCosmos: A Personal Voyage has been considered highly significant since its broadcast; David Itzkoff of The New York Times described it as \"a watershed moment for science-themed television programming\".\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nCosmos was produced in 1978 and 1979 by Los Angeles PBS member station KCET on a roughly $6.3 million budget, with over $2 million additionally allocated to promotion. The program's format is similar to earlier BBC documentaries such as Kenneth Clark's Civilisation, Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man, and David Attenborough's Life on Earth. However, unlike those series, which were shot entirely on film, Cosmos used videotape for interior scenes and special effects, with film being used for exteriors and location shooting (this film-video hybrid format was common in British scripted television at the time, but less so in documentary productions). The BBC—a co-producer of Cosmos—later screened the series, but the episodes were cut to fit 50-minute slots.\n\nThe series is notable for its groundbreaking use of special effects, which allow Sagan to seemingly walk through environments that are actually models rather than full-sized sets. The soundtrack includes pieces of music provided by Greek composer Vangelis, such as Alpha, Pulstar, and Heaven and Hell Part 1 (the last movement serves as the signature theme music for the show, and is directly referenced by the title of the fourth episode). Throughout the 13 hours of the series, many tracks from several 1970s albums are used, such as Albedo 0.39, Meddle, Spiral, Ignacio, Beaubourg, and China. The worldwide success of the documentary series put Vangelis' music in the homes of many, and brought it to the attention of a global audience.\nTurner Home Entertainment purchased Cosmos from series producer KCET in 1989. In making the move to commercial television, the hour-long episodes were edited to shorter lengths, and Sagan shot new epilogues for several episodes, in which he discussed new discoveries—and alternative viewpoints—that had arisen since the original broadcast. A 14th episode, consisting of an interview between Sagan and Ted Turner, was also produced. This new version of the series was eventually released as a VHS box set. This same re-edited version was also released on 12\" LaserDisc. Two episodes were released per disc, one episode on each side. The LaserDiscs for the various episodes were sold separately, not in a boxed set (as was done for VHS).\nCosmos was unavailable for many years after its initial release because of copyright issues with the soundtrack music, but when it was released in 2000 on worldwide NTSC DVD, subtitles in seven languages and remastered 5.1 sound were included, as well as an alternative music and sound effects track. In 2005, The Science Channel rebroadcast the series for its 25th anniversary, with updated computer graphics and film footage, digital sound, and information about relevant scientific discoveries in the intervening 25 years. Despite being shown again on the Science Channel, the total amount of time for the original 13 episodes (780 minutes) was reduced 25% to 585 minutes (45 minutes per episode) in order to make room for commercials.\nIn a 2009 UK release, Fremantle Media Enterprises digitally restored and remastered the original series as a five-disc DVD set which included bonus science updates. \n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n=== Ted Turner Interviews Carl Sagan ===\nSome versions of the series, including the first North American home video release (though not the DVD release), included a specially-made fourteenth episode, which consisted of an hour-long interview between Sagan and Ted Turner, released in 1981 in which the two discussed the series and new discoveries made in the years since its first broadcast.\n\n\n== Special edition ==\n\nThe 1986 special edition of Cosmos features new computer animated sequences and filmed segments with Sagan, as well as new narration. It includes content from Sagan's book Comet and discussion of his theory of nuclear winter; this material was not used in subsequent television or home video releases. The special edition premiered as one marathon program on the TBS network, and was later broadcast in Japan, Germany, Australia, Singapore, and Argentina. It is much shorter than the original version, at four and a half hours, divided into six 45-minute episodes:\n\nOther Worlds, Part 1\nOther Worlds, Part 2\nChildren of the Stars, Part 1\nChildren of the Stars, Part 2\nMessage from the Sky, Part 1\nMessage from the Sky, Part 2\nThe 1986 version of Cosmos contains a mix of music used in the original version, with a unique soundtrack composed by Vangelis specifically for the special edition. The score is often referred to as Comet, as \"Comet 16\" is used during the opening and closing credits of each episode. Of the 21 cues, \"Comet 16\" is the only one that has been officially released, although some of the new music appears in the 2000 remastered DVD release.\n\n\n== Music of Cosmos ==\n\n\n=== LP and cassette ===\nIn 1981, a soundtrack LP was released by RCA Records shortly after the series' airing, which included the signature theme \"Movement 3\" (from \"Symphony to the Powers B\" from the album Heaven and Hell) by Greek synthesist and composer Vangelis (catalog No. ABL 1–4003 and TMS-50061; both also released on cassette tape).\nSide A\n\nSpace / Time Continuum\n\"Movement 3\" (from \"Symphony to the Powers B\" from the album Heaven and Hell) – Vangelis\n\"Symphony No.11 In G Minor ('The Year 1905'), Op.103: The Palace Square (Adagio)\" – Dmitri Shostakovich (Performed by Leopold Stokowski and the Houston Symphony)\n\"Alpha\" (from the album Albedo 0.39)– Vangelis\nLife\n\"(Depicting) Cranes In Their Nest\" – Goro Yamaguchi\n\"Pachelbel's Canon\" – Johann Pachelbel (Performed by James Galway)\n\"The Four Seasons: Spring\" – Antonio Vivaldi\n\"The Sea Named 'Solaris' (BWV 788)\" – Johann Sebastian Bach (Performed by Isao Tomita)\nThe Harmony of Nature\n\"Partita For Violin Solo No. 3 In E, BWV 1006\" – Johann Sebastian Bach (Performed by Arthur Grumiaux)\nSide B\n\nExploration\n\"'Vishnu Symphony No. 19, Op. 217\" – Alan Hovhaness\n\"Legacy\" – Larry Fast\n\"Russian Easter Festival Overture\" – Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (Performed by Seattle Symphony)\n\"Inside The Heart Of The Universe\" – Toru Takemitsu\nCataclism\n\"Fly...Night Bird\" – Roy Buchanan\n\"Beaubourg, Part 2\" – Vangelis\n\"The Rite of Spring\" – Igor Stravinsky (Performed by Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra)\nAffirmation\n\"Entends-Tu Les Chiens Aboyer?\" – Vangelis\n\"Izlel ye Delyo Haydutin\" – Traditional (Performed by Valya Balkanska)\n\"Heaven & Hell, Part I\" – Vangelis\n\n\n=== CD ===\nIn 1994, RCA Records reissued the original soundtrack compilation on compact disc and, in 2002, reissued it on its Collectables label (RCA 07863 54003-2 USA; Collectables COL-CD-6293 USA). In 2002, a special two-disc \"collector's edition\" of music from the series was released to coincide with the DVD reissue, containing complete versions of many of the songs from the series only available as snippets on previous releases.\n\n\n==== Collector's Edition ====\nDisc One\n\n\"Heaven & Hell, Part I\" – Vangelis (4:09)\n\"The Year 1905\" – Dmitri Shostakovich (Performed by Helsinki Philharmonic) (5:38)\n\"Alpha\" – Vangelis (5:42)\n\"(Depicting) Cranes In Their Nest\" – Goro Yamaguchi (1:00)\n\"Clarinet Concerto in A Major, K. 622\" – Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Performed by Mostly Mozart Orchestra) (7:53)\n\"Pachelbel's Canon\" – Johann Pachelbel (Performed by James Galway) (5:08)\n\"Metamorphosis\" – Jeffrey Boydstun (3:34)\n\"The Sea Named 'Solaris' (BWV 788)\" – Johann Sebastian Bach (Performed by Isao Tomita) (6:04)\n\"Partita For Violin Solo No. 3 In E, BWV 1006\" – Johann Sebastian Bach (Performed by Arthur Grumiaux) (2:53)\n\"The Four Seasons: Spring\" – Antonio Vivaldi (3:21)\n\"Sonata C-Dur Für Trompete, Oboe, Und Basso Continuo\" – Gottfried Finger (Performed by Leipziger Bach-Collegium) (1:21)\n\"Concerto For Mandolin & Strings In C Major\" – Antonio Vivaldi (2:34)\n\"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\" – Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (6:35)\n\"Legacy\" – Larry Fast (5:47)\n\"Russian Easter Festival Overture\" – Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (Performed by Seattle Symphony) (7:44)\nDisc Two\n\n\"Pulstar\" – Vangelis (5:13)\n\"'Vishnu Symphony No. 19, Op. 217\" – Alan Hovhaness (4:02)\n\"Melancholy Blues\" – Louis Armstrong And His Hot Seven (2:59)\n\"Aquarius – Hair (Original Off-Broadway Cast Recording) (3:56)\n\"Beaubourg, Part 2\" – Vangelis (3:14)\n\"The Planets: Mars\" – Gustav Holst (Performed by Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra) (7:09)\n\"Alien Images 1\" – Jeff Boydstun (3:24)\n\"Fly...Night Bird\" – Roy Buchanan (7:43)\n\"Entends-Tu Les Chiens Aboyer?\" – Vangelis (2:50)\n\"The Rite of Spring\" – Igor Stravinsky (Performed by Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra) (10:31)\n\"Prayer of St. Gregory\" – Alan Hovhaness (Performed by Seattle Symphony) (4:45)\n\"Izlel ye Delyo Haydutin\" – Traditional (Performed by Valya Balkanska) (5:01)\n\"Comet 16\" – Vangelis (3:48) (Only the special edition of Cosmos)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\nThe main theme, titled Heaven and Hell, Part 1, but edited from Heaven and Hell Part 1 3rd Movement, was released in the UK as an edited 7\" single by BBC Records (Cat No: BBC1). The 7\" single did not have the quiet keyboard intro to be found on the full Vangelis LP version originally released in 1975. The B-side of the 7\" single was an edited version of Alpha, taken from the Vangelis LP Albedo 0.39.\n\n1981 Heaven and Hell / Alpha RCA 71 UK\n1981 Heaven and Hell / Alpha BBC 1\n1981 Theme from the TV-series COSMOS / Alpha PB 5356 Holland\n1981 Titelmelodie aus der TV-Serie \"Unser Kosmos\" / Alpha PB 5356 West-Germany\n\n\n== Sequel series ==\n\nOn August 5, 2011, plans were announced for a sequel to the series, bringing up-to-date special effects and scientific discoveries to the themes and messages of the original series. The new 13-part series, referred to as Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, was originally announced to premiere in the 2012–13 United States network television schedule, but a Twitter update from astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson in June 2012 indicated an early 2014 release. Episodes began airing March 9, 2014 on the Fox Network and the next day on National Geographic Channel. The new series was hosted by Tyson and produced by the two surviving original creators, Ann Druyan and Steven Soter, with Seth MacFarlane. Another sequel series from the same team (with Tyson again hosting), Cosmos: Possible Worlds, premiered on March 9, 2020, on National Geographic.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Carl Sagan Portal\nCosmos at IMDb\nThe Music of Cosmos: A Look at The Music of Vangelis Papathanassiou\nA Complete List of the Cosmos Soundtrack Music, based on the original cue sheets\nCosmos DVD review on VideoVista",

He explains methods to help distinguish between ideas that are considered valid science and those that can be considered pseudoscience. Sagan states that when new ideas are offered for consideration, they should be tested by means of skeptical thinking and should stand up to rigorous questioning.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nSagan explains that science is not just a body of knowledge, but is a way of thinking. Sagan shows how scientific thinking is both imaginative and disciplined, bringing humans to an understanding of how the universe is, rather than how they wish to perceive it. He says that science works much better than any other system because it has a \"built-in error-correcting machine\". Superstition and pseudoscience get in the way of the ability of many laypersons to appreciate the beauty and benefits of science. Skeptical thinking allows people to construct, understand, reason, and recognize valid and invalid arguments. Wherever possible, there must be independent validation of the concepts whose truth should be proved. He states that reason and logic would succeed once the truth was known. Conclusions emerge from premises, and the acceptability of the premises should not be discounted or accepted because of bias.\n\n\n=== Dragon in my garage ===\n\nAs an example of skeptical thinking, Sagan offers a story concerning a fire-breathing dragon who lives in his garage. When he persuades a rational, open-minded visitor to meet the dragon, the visitor remarks that they are unable to see the creature. Sagan replies that he \"neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon\". The visitor suggests spreading flour on the floor so that the creature's footprints might be seen, which Sagan says is a good idea, \"but this dragon floats in the air\". When the visitor considers using an infrared camera to view the creature's invisible fire, Sagan explains that her fire is heatless. He continues to counter every proposed physical test with a reason why the test will not work.\nSagan concludes by asking: \"Now what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true.\"\nContinuing with concepts relevant to the 'dragon in my garage' story, Sagan writes about a patient of John Mack who claimed to have scars on her body which were from encounters with aliens. Sagan writes that if the patient is asked what her scars look like, she is unable to show them because, unfortunately, they are located in the private areas of her body.\n \n\n\n=== Baloney detection kit ===\nSagan presents a set of tools for skeptical thinking that he calls the \"baloney detection kit\". Skeptical thinking consists both of constructing a reasoned argument and recognizing a fallacious or fraudulent one. In order to identify a fallacious argument, Sagan suggests employing such tools as independent confirmation of facts, debate, development of different hypotheses, quantification, the use of Occam's razor, and the possibility of falsification. Sagan's \"baloney detection kit\" also provides tools for detecting \"the most common fallacies of logic and rhetoric\", such as argument from authority and statistics of small numbers. Through these tools, Sagan argues the benefits of a critical mind and the self-correcting nature of science can take place.\nSagan provides nine tools as the first part of this kit.\n\nThere must be independent confirmation of the facts given when possible.\nEncourage debate on the evidence from all points of view.\nRealize that an argument from authority is not always reliable. Sagan supports this by telling us that \"authorities\" have made mistakes in the past and they will again in the future.\nConsider more than one hypothesis. Sagan adds to this by telling us that we must think of the argument from all angles and think all the ways it can be explained or disproved. The hypothesis that then still hasn't been disproved has a much higher chance of being correct.\nTry to avoid clinging obdurately to your own hypothesis and so become biased. Sagan tells us to compare our own hypothesis with others to see if we can find reasons to reject our own hypothesis.\nQuantify. Sagan tells us that if whatever we are trying to explain has numerical value or quantitative data related to it, then we'll be much more able to compete against other hypotheses.\nIf there is a chain of argument, every link in that chain must be correct.\nThe use of Occam's razor, which says to choose the hypothesis that is simpler and requires the fewest assumptions.\nAsk if a given hypothesis can be falsified. Sagan tells us that if a hypothesis cannot be tested or falsified then it is not worth considering.\nSagan suggests that with the use of this \"baloney detection kit\" it is easier to critically think and find the truth.\n\n\n==== Logical fallacies ====\nThere is a second part to the kit. This consists of twenty logical fallacies that one must not commit when offering up a new claim.\n\nAd hominem. An arguer attacks the opposing arguer and not the actual argument.\nArgument from authority. Someone expects another to immediately believe that a person of authority or higher knowledge is correct.\nArgument from adverse consequences. Someone says that something must be done a certain way or else there will be adverse consequences.\nAppeal to ignorance. One argues a claim in that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa.\nSpecial pleading. An arguer responds to a deeply complex or rhetorical question or statement by, usually, saying \"oh you don't understand how so and so works.\"\nBegging the question. An arguer assumes the answer and makes a claim such as, this happened because of that, or, this needs to happen in order for that to happen.\nObservational selection. Someone talks about how great something is by explaining all of the positive aspects of it while purposely not mentioning any of the negative aspects.\nStatistics of small numbers. Someone argues something by giving the statistics in small numbers, which isn't very reliable.\nMisunderstanding of the nature of statistics. Someone misinterprets statistics given to them.\nFallacy of inconsistency. An arguer is very inconsistent in their claims.\nNon sequitur. This is Latin for \"it doesn't follow\". A claim is made that doesn't make much sense, such as \"Our nation will prevail because God is great.\"\nPost hoc ergo propter hoc. Latin for \"it happened after, so it was caused by\". An arguer claims that something happened because of a past event when really it probably didn't.\nMeaningless question. Someone asks a question that has no real meaning or doesn't add to the argument at all.\nThe excluded middle. An arguer only considers or mentions the two opposite extremes of the conversation and excludes the aspects in between the two extremes.\nShort-term vs. long-term. A subset of the excluded middle, but so important it was pulled out for special attention.\nSlippery slope, related to excluded middle (e.g., If we allow abortion in the first weeks of pregnancy, it will be impossible to prevent the killing of a full-term infant. Or, conversely: If the state prohibits…).\nConfusion of correlation and causation. The latter causes the former.\nStraw man. Caricaturing a position to make it easier to attack. This is also a short-term/long-term fallacy.\nSuppressed evidence, or half-truth.\nWeasel word. Talleyrand said: \"An important art of politicians is to find new names for institutions which under old names have become odious to the public.\" \nSagan provides a skeptical analysis of several examples of what he refers to as superstition, fraud, and pseudoscience such as witches, UFOs, ESP, and faith healing. He is critical of organized religion.\nIn a 2020 interview for Skeptical Inquirer, when Sagan's wife Ann Druyan was asked about the origin of the phrase \"baloney detection kit\", she said that\n\nIt didn't really come from Carl. It actually came from a friend of mine named Arthur Felberbaum who died about forty years ago. He and Carl and I once sat down for dinner together. His politics were very left wing, so Carl and Arthur and I were trying to find common ground so that we could have a really good dinner together. And at one point, Arthur said, \"Carl, it's just that I dream that every one of us would have a baloney detection kit in our head.\" And that's where that idea came from.\n\n\n=== Misuse of science ===\nSagan indicates that science can be misused. Thus, he is highly critical of Edward Teller, the \"father of the hydrogen bomb\", and Teller's influence on politics, and contrasts his stance to that of Linus Pauling and other scientists who took moral positions.\nSagan also discusses the misuse of science in representation. He relates to the depiction of the mad scientist character in children's TV shows and is critical of this occurrence. Sagan suggests an addition of scientific television programs, many of which would take a look at believed hoaxes of the past and encourage viewers to engage in critical thinking to better represent science on popular television.\n\n\n==== Misuse of psychiatric authority ====\nSagan indicates that therapists can contribute to the growth of pseudoscience or the infusion of \"false stories\". He is critical of John Mack and his support of  abduction cases, which were represented in his patients.\nSagan writes about the story of Paul Ingram. Ingram's daughter reported that her father had sexually abused her. He was told that \"sex offenders often repressed memories of their crimes.\" Ingram was eventually able to have a foggy visualization of the claimed events, and he suggested that perhaps \"a demon might be responsible.\" Sagan describes how once Ingram started remembering events, so did several other individuals and family members. A \"memory recovery\" technique was performed on Ingram, and he confessed to the crimes. A medical examination was done on his daughter, where none of the scars she described were actually found. Sagan writes that Ingram later tried to plead innocence once \"away from his daughters, his police colleagues, and his pastor.\"\n\n\n==== Hoaxes ====\nHoaxes have played a valuable role in the history of science by revealing the flaws in our thinking and helping us advance our critical thinking skills. One of Sagan's examples is the \"Carlos hoax\" by James Randi that revealed flaws in reporting by news media. Carlos was described as an ancient spirit that supposedly possessed José Alvarez and provided Alvarez with advanced knowledge about the universe. Many news outlets assumed this was true and reported it as such, which spread misinformation.\nSagan also cites crop circles as hoaxes.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\nThe book was a New York Times bestseller.  The contemporary skeptical movement considers it an important book. The Demon-Haunted World has been criticized (in Smithsonian magazine and The New York Times) for not incorporating certain information relevant to the items he discusses in his book. The Smithsonian article by Paul Trachtman argues that Sagan relates issues of government choices and declining scientific thinking skills to pseudoscience topics like astrology and faith healing but ignores other issues that may be causing governmental bodies and other individuals to turn away from science. One such issue is consequences of pouring governmental money into cancer research. Trachtman writes, \"it is not because of such beliefs that Congress now approaches the NIH budget with an ax. In fact, billions of dollars spent on years of research in the war on cancer have spawned growing professional bureaucracies and diminishing medical benefits.\" Trachtman argues that Sagan does not include problems like growing bureaucracies and diminishing medical benefits as reasons for a lack of scientific attention. In his review for The New York Times, James Gorman also argues for an unaddressed issue in Sagan's book, saying Sagan fails to emphasize the idea that scientists should take a more active role in teaching science to the public, while he does mention the failures of the education system to do so.\nThe review in the Smithsonian magazine and a review by academic biologist Richard Lewontin in the New York Review of Books provide a range of opinions on Sagan's attitude towards religious ideas. Per the New York Review article, \"when it comes to the Supreme Extraterrestrial he is rather circumspect.\" The Smithsonian article suggests Sagan was very clear about his religious beliefs in the book, for he \"splits his universe in two, into science and irrationality.\" The Smithsonian goes on to say that Sagan's defined religious views fall within the area of an untestable claim, a type of claim he argues against in The Demon-Haunted World.\nLewontin's review also claims that Sagan includes something in The Demon-Haunted World which he also is arguing against in that same text. The article mentions how Sagan discusses a natural predisposition people have towards science; but, the article says, \"He does not tell us how he used the scientific method to discover the \"embedded\" human proclivity for science.\" Sagan heavily discusses the importance of using the scientific method in his book, and this article claims he strays away from his own message by not including a description of his use of the scientific method on this topic.\nA review by Lee Dembart in the Los Angeles Times was positive. It described Sagan's book as \"a manifesto for clear thought\", with the main issue being the length of eight chapters. Gorman's review in The New York Times also criticised the length of the book.\nThe book has received a number of retrospective reviews. An article in The Guardian, 2012, described the book as somewhat dated, though still insightful. Another article from The Verge in 2017 noted that a quote from the book regarding Sagan's pessimistic prediction for a future America had gone viral on Twitter, which the article described as \"chillingly prescient\". The article praised the book, stating that Sagan \"practiced the scientific skepticism and thinking that he preached, and that's what helped him accurately analyze the trends of his time and forecast their eventual outcomes in ours.\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nExtraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds – 1841 book by Charles Mackay\nJunk science – Scientific data considered to be spurious or fraudulent\nPathological science – Area of research which persists despite being widely discredited\nRationalism – Epistemological view centered on reason\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAyala, F.

In it, he explores time from the Big Bang to the discovery of quantum mechanics, via evolution and geology.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBill Bryson wrote this book because he was dissatisfied with his scientific knowledge—that was, not much at all. He writes that science was a distant, unexplained subject at school. Textbooks and teachers alike did not ignite the passion for knowledge in him, mainly because they never delved into the whys, hows, and whens.\n\n\"It was as if [the textbook writer] wanted to keep the good stuff secret by making all of it soberly unfathomable.\"\n\n\n== Contents ==\nBryson describes graphically and in layperson's terms the size of the universe and that of atoms and subatomic particles. He then explores the history of geology and biology and traces life from its first appearance to today's modern humans, emphasizing the development of the modern Homo sapiens. Furthermore, he discusses the possibility of the Earth being struck by a meteorite and reflects on human capabilities of spotting a meteor before it impacts the Earth, and the extensive damage that such an event would cause. He also describes some of the most recent destructive disasters of volcanic origin in the history of our planet, including Krakatoa and Yellowstone National Park.\nA large part of the book is devoted to relating humorous stories about the scientists behind the research and discoveries and their sometimes eccentric behaviours. Bryson also speaks about modern scientific views on human effects on the Earth's climate and livelihood of other species, and the magnitude of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and the mass extinctions caused by some of these events.\nAn illustrated edition of the book was released in November 2005. A few editions in audiobook form are also available, including an abridged version read by the author, and at least three unabridged versions.\n\n\n== Second edition ==\nRecognising both the errors in the original and, more importantly, the significant advances in scientific knowledge, a second edition was published in late 2025.  This contains extensive revisions to all chapters.\n\n\n== Awards and reviews ==\nThe book received generally favourable reviews, with reviewers citing the book as informative, well-written, and entertaining.\nIn 2004, this book won Bryson The Aventis Prizes for Science Books for best general science book. Bryson later donated the GBP£10,000 prize to the Great Ormond Street Hospital children's charity.\nIn 2005, the book won the EU Descartes Prize for science communication. It was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize for the same year.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBig History\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBill Bryson – A short history of nearly everything presentation at the Royal Society\nInterview with Mariella Frostrup (BBC Radio 4)\nA list of errata in A Short History of Nearly Everything",

In 2000, it won the Royal Society Prize for Science Books and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. A new edition was released in 2003, with an updated preface.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Part I: The Edge of Knowledge ===\nChapter 1, \"Tied Up With String\", briefly introduces the conflicts between our current theories, and how they may be resolved. He introduces the building blocks of matter, electrons and quarks, and the forces that govern them.\n\n\n=== Part II: The Dilemma of Space, Time, and the Quantum ===\nChapter 2, \"Space, Time, and the Eye of the Beholder\" explains Albert Einstein's special relativity, which united James Clerk Maxwell's electrodynamics with Galileo's principle of relativity. Einstein established that speed of light is a universal constant, and that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in relative motion. As a consequence, Isaac Newton's absolute time and space were replaced by a dynamic spacetime. \nChapter 3, \"Of Warps and Ripples\", introduces Einstein's general relativity, which resolved the conflict between Newton's theory of gravity and special relativity. General relativity explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime. \nChapter 4, \"Microscopic Weirdness\", introduces quantum mechanics. Greene begins with Max Planck's 1900 proposal that energy is absorbed and emitted in discrete units, or  quanta. In 1905, Einstein used quantum theory to explain the photoelectric effect, the extraction of electrons from a metal by light. Greene uses the double-slit experiment to illustrate wave-particle duality of light. Louis de Broglie extended this to include matter. Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that we cannot simultaneously know the position and velocity of a particle, and the more we know about one, the less we know about the other. \nChapter 5, \"The Need For a New Theory: General Relativity vs. Quantum Mechanics\" explains the conflict between the two pillars of modern physics. \n\n\n=== Part III: The Cosmic Symphony ===\nChapter 6, \"Nothing But Music: The Essentials of String Theory\" offers a brief history of string theory, starting with Gabriele Veneziano's work on the strong nuclear force. String theory replaces the conception of electrons and quarks as point particles with tiny, vibrating loops of string. One such vibration describes the properties predicted for the graviton, the postulated quantum of gravity. \nChapter 7, \"The 'Super' in Superstrings discusses the importance of symmetry in physics, and the possibility of supersymmetry. \nChapter 8, \"More Dimensions than Meets the Eye\" discusses Theodor Kaluza's proposed unification of general relativity and electromagnetism, which required an extra dimension of space. The idea was elaborated on by the mathematician Oskar Klein. \nChapter 9, \"The Smoking Gun: Experimental Signatures\" discusses criticisms of string theory, namely that it has not yet yielded testable predictions. Greene explains how this may change in the near future. \n\n\n=== Part IV: String Theory and the Fabric of Spacetime ===\nChapter 10, \"Quantum Geometry\" discusses Calabi-Yau spaces and their applications.\nChapter 11, \"Tearing the Fabric of Space\" discusses Greene's own work in string theory, and how strings could repair tears in the fabric of space\nChapter 12, \"Beyond Strings: In Search of M-Theory\" discusses the different versions of string theory, and how they might be pointing towards a single theory, mysteriously called M-Theory. \nChapter 13, \"Black Holes: A String/ M-Theory Perspective\" looks at mysteries of black holes and how they might be resolved by string theory. Greene discusses Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein's discovery of black hole thermodynamics and Hawking's discovery of Hawking radiation. \nChapter 14, \"Reflections on Cosmology\" gives an overview of the standard Big Bang model and the refinements of inflationary cosmology. String theory could answer questions such as whether the universe began with a  singularity.\n\n\n=== Part V: Unification in the Twenty-First Century ===\nChapter 15,\"Prospects\" looks at questions string theory might answer, such as the nature of space and time. He speculates about the future of the theory. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nGeorge Johson wrote in The New York Times:\n\nWriting about this area of physics, as Greene does, without assuming that the reader has any mathematical background is the hardest challenge of popular science writing. Michio Kaku, a physicist at City College in New York, provided a very nice introduction to superstrings in Beyond Einstein: The Cosmic Quest for the Theory of the Universe. But Greene goes beyond Kaku's book, exploring the ideas and recent developments with a depth and clarity I wouldn't have thought possible. Like Simon Singh in Fermat's Enigma, he has a rare ability to explain even the most evanescent ideas in a way that gives at least the illusion of understanding, enough of a mental toehold to get on with the climb.\nJohn H. Schwarz wrote:\n\nSince he is an expert in the subject, Greene's description of the current state of understanding of string theory is reliable. I am not aware of any errors in his depiction of the subject. He writes with a flair that is rare in the scientific world, and which should make the book very appealing to the lay reader. Indeed, following the publication of this book, he has become something of a media celebrity.\nIan McEwan included the book in his canon of science writing. Steven Weinberg included it on his list of the thirteen best science books for the general reader.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe Elegant Universe was adapted into an Emmy Award-winning three-hour program in three parts for television broadcast by David Hickman in late 2003 on the PBS series NOVA.\n\nEinstein's Dream\nString's The Thing\nWelcome To The 11th Dimension\nThe Elegant Universe was also interpreted by choreographer Karole Armitage, of Armitage Gone! Dance, in New York City. A performance of the work-in-progress formed part of the inaugural World Science Festival.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Fabric of the Cosmos (2004)\nThe Road to Reality (2004)\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBrian Greene, \"The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory\", Vintage Series, Random House Inc., February 2000 ISBN 0-375-70811-1\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The Elegant Universe\".

It was published on 24 November 1859. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection, although Lamarckism was also included as a mechanism of lesser importance. The book presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had collected on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.\nVarious evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.\nThe book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. Darwin was already highly regarded as a scientist, so his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T. H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism. Within two decades, there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences.\n\n",

With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences.\n\n\n== Summary of Darwin's theory ==\n\nDarwin's theory of evolution is based on key facts and the inferences drawn from them, which biologist Ernst Mayr summarised as follows:\n\nEvery species is fertile enough that if all offspring survived to reproduce, the population would grow (fact).\nDespite periodic fluctuations, populations remain roughly the same size (fact).\nResources such as food are limited and are relatively stable over time (fact).\nA struggle for survival ensues (inference).\nIndividuals in a population vary significantly from one another (fact).\nMuch of this variation is heritable (fact).\nIndividuals less suited to the environment are less likely to survive and less likely to reproduce; individuals more suited to the environment are more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce and leave their heritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of natural selection (fact).\nThis slowly effected process results in populations changing to adapt to their environments, and ultimately, these variations accumulate over time to form new species (inference).\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Developments before Darwin's theory ===\n\nIn later editions of the book, Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.\nThe Protestant Reformation inspired a literal interpretation of the Bible, with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an emerging science seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of René Descartes and the empiricism of the Baconian method. After the turmoil of the English Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem. The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan, but did recognize the hierarchical nature of different taxa. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004 BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas, but James Hutton proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism.\nCharles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s, and French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no perceptible extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.\nIn Britain, William Paley's Natural Theology saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial \"design\" by the Creator acting through natural laws. All naturalists in the two English universities (Oxford and Cambridge) were Church of England clergymen, and science became a search for these laws. Geologists adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood. Some anatomists such as Robert Grant were influenced by Lamarck and Geoffroy, but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation as a threat to divinely appointed social order.\n\n\n=== Inception of Darwin's theory ===\n\nDarwin went to Edinburgh University in 1825 to study medicine. In his second year he neglected his medical studies for natural history and spent four months helping Robert Grant's research into marine invertebrates. Grant revealed his enthusiasm for the transmutation of species, but Darwin rejected it. Starting in 1827, at Cambridge University, Darwin learnt science as natural theology from botanist John Stevens Henslow, and read Paley, John Herschel and Alexander von Humboldt. Filled with zeal for science, he studied catastrophist geology with Adam Sedgwick.\nIn December 1831, he joined the Beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist. He read Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore, at St. Jago, found Lyell's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes. Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their \"centre of creation\". The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed \"miserable, degraded savages\", and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. As the Beagle neared England in 1836, he noted that species might not be fixed.\nRichard Owen showed that fossils of extinct species Darwin found in South America were allied to living species on the same continent. In March 1837, ornithologist John Gould announced that Darwin's rhea was a separate species from the previously described rhea (though their territories overlapped), that mockingbirds collected on the Galápagos Islands represented three separate species each unique to a particular island, and that several distinct birds from those islands were all classified as finches. Darwin began speculating, in a series of notebooks, on the possibility that \"one species does change into another\" to explain these findings, and around July sketched a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to higher forms. Unconventionally, Darwin asked questions of fancy pigeon and animal breeders as well as established scientists. At the zoo he had his first sight of an ape, and was profoundly impressed by how human the orangutan seemed.\nIn late September 1838, he started reading Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population with its statistical argument that human populations, if unrestrained, breed beyond their means and struggle to survive. Darwin related this to the struggle for existence among wildlife and botanist de Candolle's \"warring of the species\" in plants; he immediately envisioned \"a force like a hundred thousand wedges\" pushing well-adapted variations into \"gaps in the economy of nature\", so that the survivors would pass on their form and abilities, and unfavourable variations would be destroyed. By December 1838, he had noted a similarity between the act of breeders selecting traits and a Malthusian Nature selecting among variants thrown up by \"chance\" so that \"every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected\".\nDarwin now had the basic framework of his theory of natural selection, but he was fully occupied with his career as a geologist and held back from compiling it until his book on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs was completed. As he recalled in his autobiography, he had \"at last got a theory by which to work\", but it was only in June 1842 that he allowed himself \"the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in pencil\".\n\n\n=== Further development ===\n\nDarwin continued to research and extensively revise his theory while focusing on his main work of publishing the scientific results of the Beagle voyage. He tentatively wrote of his ideas to Lyell in January 1842; then in June he roughed out a 35-page \"Pencil Sketch\" of his theory. Darwin began correspondence about his theorising with the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in January 1844, and by July had rounded out his \"sketch\" into a 230-page \"Essay\", to be expanded with his research results and published if he died prematurely.\nIn November 1844, the anonymously published popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, written by Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened public interest in the concept of transmutation of species. Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped to pave the way for the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s.\nHooker was persuaded to take away a copy of the \"Essay\" in January 1847, and eventually sent a page of notes giving Darwin much-needed feedback. Reminded of his lack of expertise in taxonomy, Darwin began an eight-year study of barnacles, becoming the leading expert on their classification. Using his theory, he discovered homologies showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and he found an intermediate stage in the evolution of distinct sexes.\nDarwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his young son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.\n\n\n== Publication ==\n\n\n=== Time taken to publish ===\nIn his autobiography, Darwin said he had \"gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it\". On the first page of his 1859 book he noted that, having begun work on the topic in 1837, he had drawn up \"some short notes\" after five years, had enlarged these into a sketch in 1844, and \"from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object.\"\nVarious biographers have proposed that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, and he may have wanted to be sure he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.\nA more recent study by science historian John van Wyhe has determined that the idea that Darwin delayed publication only dates back to the 1940s, and Darwin's contemporaries thought the time he took was reasonable. Darwin always finished one book before starting another. While he was researching, he told many people about his interest in transmutation without causing outrage. He firmly intended to publish, but it was not until September 1854 that he could work on it full-time. His 1846 estimate that writing his \"big book\" would take five years proved optimistic.\n\n\n=== Events leading to publication: \"big book\" manuscript ===\n\nAn 1855 paper on the \"introduction\" of species, written by Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that patterns in the geographical distribution of living and fossil species could be explained if every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1–2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a \"sketch\" account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species as his \"big book\" on Natural Selection. His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas.\n\n\n=== Joint publication of papers by Wallace and Darwin ===\nDarwin was hard at work on the manuscript for his \"big book\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\", by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\n\n\n=== Abstract of Species book ===\nSoon after the meeting, Darwin decided to write \"an abstract of my whole work\" in the form of one or more papers to be published by the Linnean Society, but was concerned about \"how it can be made scientific for a Journal, without giving facts, which would be impossible.\" He asked Hooker how many pages would be available, but \"If the Referees were to reject it as not strictly scientific I would, perhaps publish it as pamphlet.\" He began his \"abstract of Species book\" on 20 July 1858, while on holiday at Sandown, and wrote parts of it from memory, while sending the manuscripts to his friends for checking.\nBy early October, he began to \"expect my abstract will run into a small volume, which will have to be published separately.\" Over the same period, he continued to collect information and write large fully detailed sections of the manuscript for his \"big book\" on Species, Natural Selection.\n\n\n=== Murray as publisher; choice of title ===\n\nBy mid-March 1859 Darwin's abstract had reached the stage where he was thinking of early publication; Lyell suggested the publisher John Murray, and met with him to find if he would be willing to publish. On 28 March Darwin wrote to Lyell asking about progress, and offering to give Murray assurances \"that my Book is not more un-orthodox, than the subject makes inevitable.\" He enclosed a draft title sheet proposing An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection, with the year shown as \"1859\".\nMurray's response was favourable, and a very pleased Darwin told Lyell on 30 March that he would \"send shortly a large bundle of M.S. but unfortunately I cannot for a week, as the three first chapters are in three copyists' hands\". He bowed to Murray's objection to \"abstract\" in the title, though he felt it excused the lack of references, but wanted to keep \"natural selection\" which was \"constantly used in all works on Breeding\", and hoped \"to retain it with Explanation, somewhat as thus\",— Through Natural Selection or the preservation of favoured races.\nOn 31 March Darwin wrote to Murray in confirmation, and listed headings of the 12 chapters in progress: he had drafted all except \"XII. Recapitulation & Conclusion\". Murray responded immediately with an agreement to publish the book on the same terms as he published Lyell, without even seeing the manuscript: he offered Darwin two-thirds of the profits. Darwin promptly accepted with pleasure, insisting that Murray would be free to withdraw the offer if, having read the chapter manuscripts, he felt the book would not sell well (eventually Murray paid £180 to Darwin for the first edition and by Darwin's death in 1882 the book was in its sixth edition, earning Darwin nearly £3000).\nOn 5 April, Darwin sent Murray the first three chapters, and a proposal for the book's title. An early draft title page suggests On the Mutability of Species. Murray cautiously asked Whitwell Elwin to review the chapters. At Lyell's suggestion, Elwin recommended that, rather than \"put forth the theory without the evidence\", the book should focus on observations upon pigeons, briefly stating how these illustrated Darwin's general principles and preparing the way for the larger work expected shortly: \"Every body is interested in pigeons.\" Darwin responded that this was impractical: he had only the last chapter still to write. In September the main title still included \"An essay on the origin of species and varieties\", but Darwin now proposed dropping \"varieties\".\nWith Murray's persuasion, the title was eventually agreed as On the Origin of Species, with the title page adding by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. In this extended title (and elsewhere in the book) Darwin used the biological term \"races\" interchangeably with \"varieties\", meaning varieties within a species. He used the term broadly, and as well as discussions of \"the several races, for instance, of the cabbage\" and \"the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants\", there are three instances in the book where the phrase \"races of man\" is used, referring to races of humans.\n\n\n=== Publication and subsequent editions ===\nOn the Origin of Species was first published on Thursday 24 November 1859, priced at fifteen shillings with a first printing of 1250 copies. The book had been offered to booksellers at Murray's autumn sale on Tuesday 22 November, and all available copies had been taken up immediately. In total, 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies, and five for Stationers' Hall copyright, around 1,170 copies were available for sale. Significantly, 500 were taken by Mudie's Library, ensuring that the book promptly reached a large number of subscribers to the library. The second edition of 3,000 copies was quickly brought out on 7 January 1860, and incorporated numerous corrections as well as a response to religious objections by the addition of a new epigraph on page ii, a quotation from Charles Kingsley, and the phrase \"by the Creator\" added to the closing sentence. During Darwin's lifetime the book went through six editions, with cumulative changes and revisions to deal with counter-arguments raised. The third edition came out in 1861, with a number of sentences rewritten or added and an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species. In response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton's law even though the cause of gravity was unknown, and Leibnitz had accused Newton of introducing \"occult qualities & miracles\". The fourth edition in 1866 had further revisions. The fifth edition, published on 10 February 1869, incorporated more changes and for the first time included the phrase \"survival of the fittest\", which had been coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Biology (1864).\nIn January 1871, George Jackson Mivart's On the Genesis of Species listed detailed arguments against natural selection, and claimed it included false metaphysics. Darwin made extensive revisions to the sixth edition of the Origin (this was the first edition in which he used the word \"evolution\" which had commonly been associated with embryological development, though all editions concluded with the word \"evolved\"), and added a new chapter VII, Miscellaneous objections, to address Mivart's arguments.\nThe sixth edition was published by Murray on 19 February 1872 as The Origin of Species, with \"On\" dropped from the title. Darwin had told Murray of working men in Lancashire clubbing together to buy the fifth edition at 15 shillings and wanted it made more widely available; the price was halved to 7s 6d by printing in a smaller font. It includes a glossary compiled by W.S. Dallas. Book sales increased from 60 to 250 per month.\n\n\n=== Publication outside Great Britain ===\n\nIn the United States, botanist Asa Gray, an American colleague of Darwin, negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, but learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning to exploit the absence of international copyright to print Origin. Darwin was delighted by the popularity of the book, and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5% royalty with Appleton's of New York, who got their edition out in mid-January 1860, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter, Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, but it is not clear if this referred to the first printing only, as there were four that year.\nThe book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. As of 1977, Origin had appeared in an additional 18 languages, including Chinese by Ma Chün-wu who added non-Darwinian ideas; he published the preliminaries and chapters 1–5 in 1902–1904, and his complete translation in 1920.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Title pages and introduction ===\n\nPage ii contains quotations by William Whewell and Francis Bacon on the theology of natural laws, harmonising science and religion in accordance with Isaac Newton's belief in a rational God who established a law-abiding cosmos. In the second edition, Darwin added an epigraph from Joseph Butler affirming that God could work through scientific laws as much as through miracles, in a nod to the religious concerns of his oldest friends. The Introduction establishes Darwin's credentials as a naturalist and author, then refers to John Herschel's letter suggesting that the origin of species \"would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\":\n\nWHEN on board HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.\nDarwin refers specifically to the distribution of the species rheas, and to that of the Galápagos tortoises and mockingbirds. He mentions his years of work on his theory, and the arrival of Wallace at the same conclusion, which led him to \"publish this Abstract\" of his incomplete work. He outlines his ideas, and sets out the essence of his theory:\n\nAs many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.\nStarting with the third edition, Darwin prefaced the introduction with a sketch of the historical development of evolutionary ideas. In that sketch he acknowledged that Patrick Matthew had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831; in the fourth edition he mentioned that William Charles Wells had done so as early as 1813.\n\n\n=== Variation under domestication and under nature ===\nChapter I covers animal husbandry and plant breeding, going back to ancient Egypt. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes fancy pigeon breeding, noting that \"[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing\", yet all were descended from one species, the rock dove. Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \"sports\" or \"monstrosities\" (example: Ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution. In this chapter Darwin expresses his erroneous belief that environmental change is necessary to generate variation. The opening two sentences of On The Origin demonstrate this point and also show that Darwin did not see the role of natural selection in stabilizing selection:\nWhen we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature.\nIt can be seen here that Darwin attributes the greater variation amongst individuals of domestic varieties compared to their progenitor populations in nature as being due to their \"conditions of life\" (environment) being \"not so uniform as\", and \"somewhat different from\" those of the parent species\". He later erroneously elaborates that changed \"conditions of life\" act on the reproductive organs to generate greater variability in the progeny. Even after 1860 when Darwin read the correct reason for greater variation in domestic varieties in Patrick Matthew's book, On Naval Timber and Arboriculture published in 1831, future editions of On the Origin of Species contained these first two sentences unchanged and continued to omit the correct explanation of stabilizing selection.\nIn Chapter II, Darwin specifies that the distinction between species and varieties is arbitrary, with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found. He concludes that \"a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species\" and that \"species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties\". He argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature. Historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another, but had generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the archetype of each species, that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of God. Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world.\n\n\n=== Struggle for existence, natural selection, and divergence ===\nIn Chapter III, Darwin asks how varieties \"which I have called incipient species\" become distinct species, and in answer introduces the key concept he calls \"natural selection\"; in the fifth edition he adds, \"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\"\n\nOwing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring ... I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.\nHe notes that both A. P. de Candolle and Charles Lyell had stated that all organisms are exposed to severe competition. Darwin emphasizes that he used the phrase \"struggle for existence\" in \"a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another\"; he gives examples ranging from plants struggling against drought to plants competing for birds to eat their fruit and disseminate their seeds. He describes the struggle resulting from population growth: \"It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.\" He discusses checks to such increase including complex ecological interdependencies, and notes that competition is most severe between closely related forms \"which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature\".\nChapter IV details natural selection under the \"infinitely complex and close-fitting ... mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life\". Darwin takes as an example a country where a change in conditions led to extinction of some species, immigration of others and, where suitable variations occurred, descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions. He remarks that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence in character between breeds, and suggests that natural selection might do the same, saying:\n\nBut how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.\nHistorians have remarked that here Darwin anticipated the modern concept of an ecological niche. He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.\n\nDarwin proposes sexual selection, driven by competition between males for mates, to explain sexually dimorphic features such as lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds. He analysed sexual selection more fully in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could \"see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection\". Using a tree diagram and calculations, he indicates the \"divergence of character\" from original species into new species and genera. He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred, while new branches formed in \"the great Tree of life ... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications\".\n\n\n=== Variation and heredity ===\nIn Darwin's time there was no agreed-upon model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, \"The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown.\" He accepted a version of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought \"there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited\", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island-dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism.\nBreeding of animals and plants showed related varieties varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.\nMore detail was given in Darwin's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel's theories of genetic inheritance.\n\n\n=== Difficulties for the theory ===\nChapter VI begins by saying the next three chapters will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, \"Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms?  Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?\" Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms.\nAnother difficulty, related to the first one, is the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in time. Darwin commented that by the theory of natural selection \"innumerable transitional forms must have existed,\" and wondered \"why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?\" (For further discussion of these difficulties, see Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist? and Bernstein et al. and Michod.)\nThe chapter then deals with whether natural selection could produce complex specialised structures, and the behaviours to use them, when it would be difficult to imagine how intermediate forms could be functional. Darwin said:\n\nSecondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection?\nHis answer was that in many cases animals exist with intermediate structures that are functional. He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors. He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved. Darwin concludes: \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\"\nIn a section on \"organs of little apparent importance\", Darwin discusses the difficulty of explaining various seemingly trivial traits with no evident adaptive function, and outlines some possibilities such as correlation with useful features. He accepts that we \"are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations\" which distinguish domesticated breeds of animals, and human races. He suggests that sexual selection might explain these variations:\n\nI might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.\nChapter VII (of the first edition) addresses the evolution of instincts. His examples included two he had investigated experimentally: slave-making ants and the construction of hexagonal cells by honey bees. Darwin noted that some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others, and he observed that many ant species will collect and store the pupae of other species as food. He thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps. He suggested that bees that make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells, under pressure from natural selection to economise wax. Darwin concluded:\n\nFinally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, —ants making slaves, —the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, —not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\nChapter VIII addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species. Darwin said that, far from being constant, the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species, and the viability and fertility of the hybrids, varied greatly, especially among plants. Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely, and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty. Darwin concluded: \"Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.\"\nIn the sixth edition Darwin inserted a new chapter VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and could not have been produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes on one side and the camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.\n\n\n=== Geological record ===\nChapter IX deals with the fact that the geological record appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable transitional fossils expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell's argument in Principles of Geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well-founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he cited the example of The Weald as discussed in Principles of Geology together with other observations from Hugh Miller, James Smith of Jordanhill and Andrew Ramsay. Combining this with an estimate of recent rates of sedimentation and erosion, Darwin calculated that erosion of The Weald had taken around 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well-developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.\nChapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, but not at the same rate – some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.\n\n\n=== Geographic distribution ===\nChapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography, starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: \"On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.\" Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.\nChapter XII continues the discussion of biogeography. After a brief discussion of freshwater species, it returns to oceanic islands and their peculiarities; for example on some islands roles played by mammals on continents were played by other animals such as flightless birds or reptiles. The summary of both chapters says:\n\n... I think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent ... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar; ...\n\n\n=== Classification, morphology, embryology, rudimentary organs ===\nChapter XIII starts by observing that classification depends on species being grouped together in a Taxonomy, a multilevel system of groups and sub-groups based on varying degrees of resemblance. After discussing classification issues, Darwin concludes:\n\nAll the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, ...\nDarwin discusses morphology, including the importance of homologous structures. He says, \"What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?\" This made no sense under doctrines of independent creation of species, as even Richard Owen had admitted, but the \"explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications\" showing common descent. He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar embryos. Darwin discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in baleen whales, are found only in embryonic stages. These factors also supported his theory of descent with modification.\n\n\n=== Concluding remarks ===\nThe final chapter, \"Recapitulation and Conclusion\", reviews points from earlier chapters, and Darwin concludes by hoping that his theory might produce revolutionary changes in many fields of natural history. He suggests that psychology will be put on a new foundation and implies the relevance of his theory to the first appearance of humanity with the sentence that \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\" Darwin ends with a passage that became well known and much quoted:\n\nIt is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us ... Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\nDarwin added the phrase \"by the Creator\" from the 1860 second edition onwards, so that the ultimate sentence begins \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\".\n\n\n== Structure, style, and themes ==\n\n\n=== Nature and structure of Darwin's argument ===\nDarwin's aims were twofold: to show that species had not been separately created, and to show that natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar with the concept of transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.\nLater chapters provide evidence that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternative concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, and its ability to explain a wide range of observations. This reflected the influence of William Whewell's idea of a consilience of inductions, as explained in his work Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, where if you could argue that a proposed mechanism successfully explained various phenomena you could then use those arguments as evidence for that mechanism.\n\n\n=== Literary style ===\nThe Examiner review of 3 December 1859 commented, \"Much of Mr. Darwin's volume is what ordinary readers would call 'tough reading;' that is, writing which to comprehend requires concentrated attention and some preparation for the task. All, however, is by no means of this description, and many parts of the book abound in information, easy to comprehend and both instructive and entertaining.\"\nWhile the book was readable enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Though Richard Owen did complain in the Quarterly Review that the style was too easy for a serious work of science. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.\n\n\n=== Human evolution ===\nFrom his early transmutation notebooks in the late 1830s onwards, Darwin considered human evolution as part of the natural processes he was investigating, and rejected divine intervention. In 1856, his \"big book on species\" titled Natural Selection was to include a \"note on Man\", but when Wallace enquired in December 1857, Darwin replied; \"You ask whether I shall discuss 'man';—I think I shall avoid whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest & most interesting problem for the naturalist.\"\nOn 28 March 1859, with his manuscript for the book well under way, Darwin wrote to Lyell offering the suggested publisher John Murray assurances \"That I do not discuss origin of man\".\nIn the final chapter of On the Origin of Species, \"Recapitulation and Conclusion\", Darwin briefly highlights the human implications of his theory:\n\n\"In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"\nDiscussing this in January 1860, Darwin assured Lyell that \"by the sentence [Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history] I show that I believe man is in same predicament with other animals. Many modern writers have seen this sentence as Darwin's only reference to humans in the book; Janet Browne describes it as his only discussion there of human origins, while noting that the book makes other references to humanity.\nSome other statements in the book are quietly effective at pointing out the implication that humans are simply another species, evolving through the same processes and principles affecting other organisms. For example, in Chapter III: \"Struggle for Existence\" Darwin includes \"slow-breeding man\" among other examples of Malthusian population growth. In his discussions on morphology, Darwin compares and comments on bone structures that are homologous between humans and other mammals.\nDarwin's early notebooks discussed how non-adaptive characteristics could be selected when animals or humans chose mates, with races of humans differing over ideas of beauty. In his 1856 notes responding to Robert Knox's The Races of Man: A Fragment, he called this effect sexual selection. He added notes on sexual selection to his \"big book on species\", and in mid-1857 he added a section heading \"Theory applied to Races of Man\", but did not add text on this topic.\nIn On the Origin of Species, Chapter VI: \"Difficulties on Theory\", Darwin mentions this in the context of \"slight and unimportant variations\":\n\nI might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.\"\nWhen Darwin published The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex twelve years later, he said that he had not gone into detail on human evolution in the Origin as he thought that would \"only add to the prejudices against my views\". He had not completely avoided the topic:\n\nIt seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my \"Origin of Species,\" that by this work \"light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;\" and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.\nHe also said that he had \"merely alluded\" in that book to sexual selection differentiating human races.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe book aroused international interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much of the initial reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. Bishop Samuel Wilberforce wrote a review in Quarterly Review in 1860 where he disagreed with Darwin's 'argument'. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term 'Darwinism' was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.\nWhile Darwin had been somewhat coy about human origins, not identifying any explicit conclusion on the matter in his book, he had dropped enough hints about human's animal ancestry for the inference to be made, and the first review claimed it made a creed of the \"men from monkeys\" idea from Vestiges. Human evolution became central to the debate and was strongly argued by Huxley who featured it in his popular \"working-men's lectures\". Darwin did not publish his own views on this until 1871.\nThe naturalism of natural selection conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms 'evolution' and 'survival of the fittest', and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.\n\n\n=== Impact on the scientific community ===\n\nScientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \"law of development\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive idea that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay Archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.\n\nEvolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\" and coining the term \"Darwinism\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late-Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies.\nThe leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \"ordained becoming\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \"creation by birth\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \"Great Hippocampus Question\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \"great hippopotamus test\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871).\n\n\n==== Impact outside Great Britain ====\n\nThe German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond converted to Darwinism after reading an English copy of On the Origin of Species in the spring of 1860. Du Bois-Reymond was a committed supporter, securing Darwin an honorary degree from the University of Breslau, teaching his theory to students at the University of Berlin, and defending his name to paying audiences across Germany and The Netherlands. Du Bois-Reymond's exposition resembled Darwin's: he endorsed natural selection, rejected the inheritance of acquired characters, remained silent on the origin of variation, and identified \"the altruism of bees, the regeneration of tissue, the effects of exercise, and the inheritance of disadvantageous traits\" as puzzles presented by the theory.\nEvolutionary ideas, although not natural selection, were accepted by other German biologists accustomed to ideas of homology in morphology from Goethe's Metamorphosis of Plants and from their long tradition of comparative anatomy. Bronn's alterations in his German translation added to the misgivings of conservatives but encouraged political radicals. Ernst Haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise Darwin's ideas with those of Lamarck and Goethe while still reflecting the spirit of Naturphilosophie. His ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life was joined by Huxley and supported by discoveries in palaeontology. Haeckel used embryology extensively in his recapitulation theory, which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution. Darwin was cautious about such histories, and had already noted that von Baer's laws of embryology supported his idea of complex branching.\nAsa Gray promoted and defended Origin against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably Louis Agassiz, who viewed every species as a distinct fixed unit in the mind of the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties. Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory.\nFrench-speaking naturalists in several countries showed appreciation of the much-modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.\n\n\n==== Challenges to natural selection ====\nThere were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Carl Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that the Sun, and therefore life on Earth, was only about 100 million years old. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the fifth edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.\nBy the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" included forms of \"saltationism\" in which new species were thought to arise through \"jumps\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of August Weismann, that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called neo-Darwinism. It was thought that the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance invalidated Darwin's views.\n\n\n=== Impact on economic and political debates ===\nWhile some, like Spencer, used analogy from natural selection as an argument against government intervention in the economy to benefit the poor, others, including Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities to level the playing field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non-white races and justify European imperialism. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.\n\n\n=== Religious attitudes ===\n\nThe book produced a wide range of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English-speaking world.\nNatural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful. In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \"just as noble a conception of Deity\". In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as \"a celebrated cleric\", and added the phrase \"by the Creator\" to the closing sentence, which from then on read \"life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\". While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted, Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature, and even in the first edition there are several references to \"creation\".\nBaden Powell praised \"Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature\". In America, Asa Gray argued that evolution is the secondary effect, or modus operandi, of the first cause, design, and published a pamphlet defending the book in terms of theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with Natural Theology. Theistic evolution became a popular compromise, and St. George Jackson Mivart was among those accepting evolution but attacking Darwin's naturalistic mechanism. Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as neo-Lamarckism were favoured over natural selection as being more compatible with purpose.\nEven though the book did not explicitly spell out Darwin's beliefs about human origins, it had dropped a number of hints about human's animal ancestry and quickly became central to the debate, as mental and moral qualities were seen as spiritual aspects of the immaterial soul, and it was believed that animals did not have spiritual qualities. This conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans, or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind's position at the head of nature. While many conservative theologians accepted evolution, Charles Hodge argued in his 1874 critique \"What is Darwinism?\" that \"Darwinism\", defined narrowly as including rejection of design, was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design. Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin's text. By the early 20th century, four noted authors of The Fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution, but fundamentalism inspired the American creation–evolution controversy that began in the 1920s. Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century, but other Catholic writers, starting with Mivart, pointed out that early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area. The English cardinal John Henry Newman stated in a letter that “… Darwin's theory need not then to be atheistical, be it true or not; it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of Divine Prescience and Skill.” The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical, which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching.\n\n\n== Modern influence ==\n\nVarious alternative evolutionary mechanisms favoured during \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" became untenable as more was learned about inheritance and mutation. The full significance of natural selection was at last accepted in the 1930s and 1940s as part of the modern evolutionary synthesis. During that synthesis biologists and statisticians, including R. A. Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane, merged Darwinian selection with a statistical understanding of Mendelian genetics.\nModern evolutionary theory continues to develop. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geological record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.\nInterest in Darwin's writings continues, and scholars have generated an extensive literature, the Darwin Industry, about his life and work. The text of Origin itself has been subject to much analysis including a variorum, detailing the changes made in every edition, first published in 1959, and a concordance, an exhaustive external index published in 1981. Worldwide commemorations of the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species and the bicentenary of Darwin's birth were scheduled for 2009. They celebrated the ideas which \"over the last 150 years have revolutionised our understanding of nature and our place within it\".\nIn a survey conducted by a group of academic booksellers, publishers and librarians in advance of Academic Book Week in the United Kingdom, On the Origin of Species was voted the most influential academic book ever written. It was hailed as \"the supreme demonstration of why academic books matter\" and \"a book which has changed the way we think about everything\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCharles Darwin bibliography\nThe Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online\nThe Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, published in 1871; his second major book on evolutionary theory.\nHistory of biology\nHistory of evolutionary thought\nHistory of speciation\nModern evolutionary synthesis\nTransmutation of species\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nBrowne, Janet (2007), Darwin's Origin of Species: A Biography, Grove Press, ISBN 978-0-87113-953-5\nMalthus, Thomas Robert (1826), An Essay on the Principle of Population: A View of its Past and Present Effects on Human Happiness; with an Inquiry into Our Prospects Respecting the Future Removal or Mitigation of the Evils which It Occasions, vol. 1 (6th ed.), London: John Murray, retrieved 13 November 2017 (Vol. 2)\nReznick, David N.

With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences.\n\n\n== Summary of Darwin's theory ==\n\nDarwin's theory of evolution is based on key facts and the inferences drawn from them, which biologist Ernst Mayr summarised as follows:\n\nEvery species is fertile enough that if all offspring survived to reproduce, the population would grow (fact).\nDespite periodic fluctuations, populations remain roughly the same size (fact).\nResources such as food are limited and are relatively stable over time (fact).\nA struggle for survival ensues (inference).\nIndividuals in a population vary significantly from one another (fact).\nMuch of this variation is heritable (fact).\nIndividuals less suited to the environment are less likely to survive and less likely to reproduce; individuals more suited to the environment are more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce and leave their heritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of natural selection (fact).\nThis slowly effected process results in populations changing to adapt to their environments, and ultimately, these variations accumulate over time to form new species (inference).\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Developments before Darwin's theory ===\n\nIn later editions of the book, Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.\nThe Protestant Reformation inspired a literal interpretation of the Bible, with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an emerging science seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of René Descartes and the empiricism of the Baconian method. After the turmoil of the English Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God's benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem. The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan, but did recognize the hierarchical nature of different taxa. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004 BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas, but James Hutton proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism.\nCharles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s, and French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no perceptible extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.\nIn Britain, William Paley's Natural Theology saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial \"design\" by the Creator acting through natural laws. All naturalists in the two English universities (Oxford and Cambridge) were Church of England clergymen, and science became a search for these laws. Geologists adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood. Some anatomists such as Robert Grant were influenced by Lamarck and Geoffroy, but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation as a threat to divinely appointed social order.\n\n\n=== Inception of Darwin's theory ===\n\nDarwin went to Edinburgh University in 1825 to study medicine. In his second year he neglected his medical studies for natural history and spent four months helping Robert Grant's research into marine invertebrates. Grant revealed his enthusiasm for the transmutation of species, but Darwin rejected it. Starting in 1827, at Cambridge University, Darwin learnt science as natural theology from botanist John Stevens Henslow, and read Paley, John Herschel and Alexander von Humboldt. Filled with zeal for science, he studied catastrophist geology with Adam Sedgwick.\nIn December 1831, he joined the Beagle expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist. He read Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and from the first stop ashore, at St. Jago, found Lyell's uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes. Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their \"centre of creation\". The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed \"miserable, degraded savages\", and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. As the Beagle neared England in 1836, he noted that species might not be fixed.\nRichard Owen showed that fossils of extinct species Darwin found in South America were allied to living species on the same continent. In March 1837, ornithologist John Gould announced that Darwin's rhea was a separate species from the previously described rhea (though their territories overlapped), that mockingbirds collected on the Galápagos Islands represented three separate species each unique to a particular island, and that several distinct birds from those islands were all classified as finches. Darwin began speculating, in a series of notebooks, on the possibility that \"one species does change into another\" to explain these findings, and around July sketched a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, discarding Lamarck's independent lineages progressing to higher forms. Unconventionally, Darwin asked questions of fancy pigeon and animal breeders as well as established scientists. At the zoo he had his first sight of an ape, and was profoundly impressed by how human the orangutan seemed.\nIn late September 1838, he started reading Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population with its statistical argument that human populations, if unrestrained, breed beyond their means and struggle to survive. Darwin related this to the struggle for existence among wildlife and botanist de Candolle's \"warring of the species\" in plants; he immediately envisioned \"a force like a hundred thousand wedges\" pushing well-adapted variations into \"gaps in the economy of nature\", so that the survivors would pass on their form and abilities, and unfavourable variations would be destroyed. By December 1838, he had noted a similarity between the act of breeders selecting traits and a Malthusian Nature selecting among variants thrown up by \"chance\" so that \"every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected\".\nDarwin now had the basic framework of his theory of natural selection, but he was fully occupied with his career as a geologist and held back from compiling it until his book on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs was completed. As he recalled in his autobiography, he had \"at last got a theory by which to work\", but it was only in June 1842 that he allowed himself \"the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in pencil\".\n\n\n=== Further development ===\n\nDarwin continued to research and extensively revise his theory while focusing on his main work of publishing the scientific results of the Beagle voyage. He tentatively wrote of his ideas to Lyell in January 1842; then in June he roughed out a 35-page \"Pencil Sketch\" of his theory. Darwin began correspondence about his theorising with the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in January 1844, and by July had rounded out his \"sketch\" into a 230-page \"Essay\", to be expanded with his research results and published if he died prematurely.\nIn November 1844, the anonymously published popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, written by Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened public interest in the concept of transmutation of species. Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped to pave the way for the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s.\nHooker was persuaded to take away a copy of the \"Essay\" in January 1847, and eventually sent a page of notes giving Darwin much-needed feedback. Reminded of his lack of expertise in taxonomy, Darwin began an eight-year study of barnacles, becoming the leading expert on their classification. Using his theory, he discovered homologies showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and he found an intermediate stage in the evolution of distinct sexes.\nDarwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his young son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.\n\n\n== Publication ==\n\n\n=== Time taken to publish ===\nIn his autobiography, Darwin said he had \"gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it\". On the first page of his 1859 book he noted that, having begun work on the topic in 1837, he had drawn up \"some short notes\" after five years, had enlarged these into a sketch in 1844, and \"from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object.\"\nVarious biographers have proposed that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, and he may have wanted to be sure he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.\nA more recent study by science historian John van Wyhe has determined that the idea that Darwin delayed publication only dates back to the 1940s, and Darwin's contemporaries thought the time he took was reasonable. Darwin always finished one book before starting another. While he was researching, he told many people about his interest in transmutation without causing outrage. He firmly intended to publish, but it was not until September 1854 that he could work on it full-time. His 1846 estimate that writing his \"big book\" would take five years proved optimistic.\n\n\n=== Events leading to publication: \"big book\" manuscript ===\n\nAn 1855 paper on the \"introduction\" of species, written by Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that patterns in the geographical distribution of living and fossil species could be explained if every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace's paper and its possible connection to Darwin's work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1–2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a \"sketch\" account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species as his \"big book\" on Natural Selection. His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas.\n\n\n=== Joint publication of papers by Wallace and Darwin ===\nDarwin was hard at work on the manuscript for his \"big book\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\", by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\n\n\n=== Abstract of Species book ===\nSoon after the meeting, Darwin decided to write \"an abstract of my whole work\" in the form of one or more papers to be published by the Linnean Society, but was concerned about \"how it can be made scientific for a Journal, without giving facts, which would be impossible.\" He asked Hooker how many pages would be available, but \"If the Referees were to reject it as not strictly scientific I would, perhaps publish it as pamphlet.\" He began his \"abstract of Species book\" on 20 July 1858, while on holiday at Sandown, and wrote parts of it from memory, while sending the manuscripts to his friends for checking.\nBy early October, he began to \"expect my abstract will run into a small volume, which will have to be published separately.\" Over the same period, he continued to collect information and write large fully detailed sections of the manuscript for his \"big book\" on Species, Natural Selection.\n\n\n=== Murray as publisher; choice of title ===\n\nBy mid-March 1859 Darwin's abstract had reached the stage where he was thinking of early publication; Lyell suggested the publisher John Murray, and met with him to find if he would be willing to publish. On 28 March Darwin wrote to Lyell asking about progress, and offering to give Murray assurances \"that my Book is not more un-orthodox, than the subject makes inevitable.\" He enclosed a draft title sheet proposing An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection, with the year shown as \"1859\".\nMurray's response was favourable, and a very pleased Darwin told Lyell on 30 March that he would \"send shortly a large bundle of M.S. but unfortunately I cannot for a week, as the three first chapters are in three copyists' hands\". He bowed to Murray's objection to \"abstract\" in the title, though he felt it excused the lack of references, but wanted to keep \"natural selection\" which was \"constantly used in all works on Breeding\", and hoped \"to retain it with Explanation, somewhat as thus\",— Through Natural Selection or the preservation of favoured races.\nOn 31 March Darwin wrote to Murray in confirmation, and listed headings of the 12 chapters in progress: he had drafted all except \"XII. Recapitulation & Conclusion\". Murray responded immediately with an agreement to publish the book on the same terms as he published Lyell, without even seeing the manuscript: he offered Darwin two-thirds of the profits. Darwin promptly accepted with pleasure, insisting that Murray would be free to withdraw the offer if, having read the chapter manuscripts, he felt the book would not sell well (eventually Murray paid £180 to Darwin for the first edition and by Darwin's death in 1882 the book was in its sixth edition, earning Darwin nearly £3000).\nOn 5 April, Darwin sent Murray the first three chapters, and a proposal for the book's title. An early draft title page suggests On the Mutability of Species. Murray cautiously asked Whitwell Elwin to review the chapters. At Lyell's suggestion, Elwin recommended that, rather than \"put forth the theory without the evidence\", the book should focus on observations upon pigeons, briefly stating how these illustrated Darwin's general principles and preparing the way for the larger work expected shortly: \"Every body is interested in pigeons.\" Darwin responded that this was impractical: he had only the last chapter still to write. In September the main title still included \"An essay on the origin of species and varieties\", but Darwin now proposed dropping \"varieties\".\nWith Murray's persuasion, the title was eventually agreed as On the Origin of Species, with the title page adding by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. In this extended title (and elsewhere in the book) Darwin used the biological term \"races\" interchangeably with \"varieties\", meaning varieties within a species. He used the term broadly, and as well as discussions of \"the several races, for instance, of the cabbage\" and \"the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants\", there are three instances in the book where the phrase \"races of man\" is used, referring to races of humans.\n\n\n=== Publication and subsequent editions ===\nOn the Origin of Species was first published on Thursday 24 November 1859, priced at fifteen shillings with a first printing of 1250 copies. The book had been offered to booksellers at Murray's autumn sale on Tuesday 22 November, and all available copies had been taken up immediately. In total, 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies, and five for Stationers' Hall copyright, around 1,170 copies were available for sale. Significantly, 500 were taken by Mudie's Library, ensuring that the book promptly reached a large number of subscribers to the library. The second edition of 3,000 copies was quickly brought out on 7 January 1860, and incorporated numerous corrections as well as a response to religious objections by the addition of a new epigraph on page ii, a quotation from Charles Kingsley, and the phrase \"by the Creator\" added to the closing sentence. During Darwin's lifetime the book went through six editions, with cumulative changes and revisions to deal with counter-arguments raised. The third edition came out in 1861, with a number of sentences rewritten or added and an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species. In response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton's law even though the cause of gravity was unknown, and Leibnitz had accused Newton of introducing \"occult qualities & miracles\". The fourth edition in 1866 had further revisions. The fifth edition, published on 10 February 1869, incorporated more changes and for the first time included the phrase \"survival of the fittest\", which had been coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his Principles of Biology (1864).\nIn January 1871, George Jackson Mivart's On the Genesis of Species listed detailed arguments against natural selection, and claimed it included false metaphysics. Darwin made extensive revisions to the sixth edition of the Origin (this was the first edition in which he used the word \"evolution\" which had commonly been associated with embryological development, though all editions concluded with the word \"evolved\"), and added a new chapter VII, Miscellaneous objections, to address Mivart's arguments.\nThe sixth edition was published by Murray on 19 February 1872 as The Origin of Species, with \"On\" dropped from the title. Darwin had told Murray of working men in Lancashire clubbing together to buy the fifth edition at 15 shillings and wanted it made more widely available; the price was halved to 7s 6d by printing in a smaller font. It includes a glossary compiled by W.S. Dallas. Book sales increased from 60 to 250 per month.\n\n\n=== Publication outside Great Britain ===\n\nIn the United States, botanist Asa Gray, an American colleague of Darwin, negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, but learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning to exploit the absence of international copyright to print Origin. Darwin was delighted by the popularity of the book, and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5% royalty with Appleton's of New York, who got their edition out in mid-January 1860, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter, Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, but it is not clear if this referred to the first printing only, as there were four that year.\nThe book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. As of 1977, Origin had appeared in an additional 18 languages, including Chinese by Ma Chün-wu who added non-Darwinian ideas; he published the preliminaries and chapters 1–5 in 1902–1904, and his complete translation in 1920.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Title pages and introduction ===\n\nPage ii contains quotations by William Whewell and Francis Bacon on the theology of natural laws, harmonising science and religion in accordance with Isaac Newton's belief in a rational God who established a law-abiding cosmos. In the second edition, Darwin added an epigraph from Joseph Butler affirming that God could work through scientific laws as much as through miracles, in a nod to the religious concerns of his oldest friends. The Introduction establishes Darwin's credentials as a naturalist and author, then refers to John Herschel's letter suggesting that the origin of species \"would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\":\n\nWHEN on board HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.\nDarwin refers specifically to the distribution of the species rheas, and to that of the Galápagos tortoises and mockingbirds. He mentions his years of work on his theory, and the arrival of Wallace at the same conclusion, which led him to \"publish this Abstract\" of his incomplete work. He outlines his ideas, and sets out the essence of his theory:\n\nAs many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.\nStarting with the third edition, Darwin prefaced the introduction with a sketch of the historical development of evolutionary ideas. In that sketch he acknowledged that Patrick Matthew had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831; in the fourth edition he mentioned that William Charles Wells had done so as early as 1813.\n\n\n=== Variation under domestication and under nature ===\nChapter I covers animal husbandry and plant breeding, going back to ancient Egypt. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes fancy pigeon breeding, noting that \"[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing\", yet all were descended from one species, the rock dove. Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \"sports\" or \"monstrosities\" (example: Ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution. In this chapter Darwin expresses his erroneous belief that environmental change is necessary to generate variation. The opening two sentences of On The Origin demonstrate this point and also show that Darwin did not see the role of natural selection in stabilizing selection:\nWhen we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature.\nIt can be seen here that Darwin attributes the greater variation amongst individuals of domestic varieties compared to their progenitor populations in nature as being due to their \"conditions of life\" (environment) being \"not so uniform as\", and \"somewhat different from\" those of the parent species\". He later erroneously elaborates that changed \"conditions of life\" act on the reproductive organs to generate greater variability in the progeny. Even after 1860 when Darwin read the correct reason for greater variation in domestic varieties in Patrick Matthew's book, On Naval Timber and Arboriculture published in 1831, future editions of On the Origin of Species contained these first two sentences unchanged and continued to omit the correct explanation of stabilizing selection.\nIn Chapter II, Darwin specifies that the distinction between species and varieties is arbitrary, with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found. He concludes that \"a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species\" and that \"species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties\". He argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature. Historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another, but had generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the archetype of each species, that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of God. Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world.\n\n\n=== Struggle for existence, natural selection, and divergence ===\nIn Chapter III, Darwin asks how varieties \"which I have called incipient species\" become distinct species, and in answer introduces the key concept he calls \"natural selection\"; in the fifth edition he adds, \"But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\"\n\nOwing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring ... I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.\nHe notes that both A. P. de Candolle and Charles Lyell had stated that all organisms are exposed to severe competition. Darwin emphasizes that he used the phrase \"struggle for existence\" in \"a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another\"; he gives examples ranging from plants struggling against drought to plants competing for birds to eat their fruit and disseminate their seeds. He describes the struggle resulting from population growth: \"It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.\" He discusses checks to such increase including complex ecological interdependencies, and notes that competition is most severe between closely related forms \"which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature\".\nChapter IV details natural selection under the \"infinitely complex and close-fitting ... mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life\". Darwin takes as an example a country where a change in conditions led to extinction of some species, immigration of others and, where suitable variations occurred, descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions. He remarks that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence in character between breeds, and suggests that natural selection might do the same, saying:\n\nBut how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.\nHistorians have remarked that here Darwin anticipated the modern concept of an ecological niche. He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.\n\nDarwin proposes sexual selection, driven by competition between males for mates, to explain sexually dimorphic features such as lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds. He analysed sexual selection more fully in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could \"see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection\". Using a tree diagram and calculations, he indicates the \"divergence of character\" from original species into new species and genera. He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred, while new branches formed in \"the great Tree of life ... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications\".\n\n\n=== Variation and heredity ===\nIn Darwin's time there was no agreed-upon model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, \"The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown.\" He accepted a version of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought \"there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited\", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island-dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism.\nBreeding of animals and plants showed related varieties varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.\nMore detail was given in Darwin's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel's theories of genetic inheritance.\n\n\n=== Difficulties for the theory ===\nChapter VI begins by saying the next three chapters will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, \"Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms?  Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?\" Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms.\nAnother difficulty, related to the first one, is the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in time. Darwin commented that by the theory of natural selection \"innumerable transitional forms must have existed,\" and wondered \"why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?\" (For further discussion of these difficulties, see Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist? and Bernstein et al. and Michod.)\nThe chapter then deals with whether natural selection could produce complex specialised structures, and the behaviours to use them, when it would be difficult to imagine how intermediate forms could be functional. Darwin said:\n\nSecondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection?\nHis answer was that in many cases animals exist with intermediate structures that are functional. He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors. He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved. Darwin concludes: \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\"\nIn a section on \"organs of little apparent importance\", Darwin discusses the difficulty of explaining various seemingly trivial traits with no evident adaptive function, and outlines some possibilities such as correlation with useful features. He accepts that we \"are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations\" which distinguish domesticated breeds of animals, and human races. He suggests that sexual selection might explain these variations:\n\nI might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.\nChapter VII (of the first edition) addresses the evolution of instincts. His examples included two he had investigated experimentally: slave-making ants and the construction of hexagonal cells by honey bees. Darwin noted that some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others, and he observed that many ant species will collect and store the pupae of other species as food. He thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps. He suggested that bees that make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells, under pressure from natural selection to economise wax. Darwin concluded:\n\nFinally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, —ants making slaves, —the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, —not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\nChapter VIII addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species. Darwin said that, far from being constant, the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species, and the viability and fertility of the hybrids, varied greatly, especially among plants. Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely, and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty. Darwin concluded: \"Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.\"\nIn the sixth edition Darwin inserted a new chapter VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and could not have been produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes on one side and the camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.\n\n\n=== Geological record ===\nChapter IX deals with the fact that the geological record appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable transitional fossils expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell's argument in Principles of Geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well-founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he cited the example of The Weald as discussed in Principles of Geology together with other observations from Hugh Miller, James Smith of Jordanhill and Andrew Ramsay. Combining this with an estimate of recent rates of sedimentation and erosion, Darwin calculated that erosion of The Weald had taken around 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well-developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.\nChapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, but not at the same rate – some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.\n\n\n=== Geographic distribution ===\nChapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography, starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: \"On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.\" Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.\nChapter XII continues the discussion of biogeography. After a brief discussion of freshwater species, it returns to oceanic islands and their peculiarities; for example on some islands roles played by mammals on continents were played by other animals such as flightless birds or reptiles. The summary of both chapters says:\n\n... I think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent ... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar; ...\n\n\n=== Classification, morphology, embryology, rudimentary organs ===\nChapter XIII starts by observing that classification depends on species being grouped together in a Taxonomy, a multilevel system of groups and sub-groups based on varying degrees of resemblance. After discussing classification issues, Darwin concludes:\n\nAll the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, ...\nDarwin discusses morphology, including the importance of homologous structures. He says, \"What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?\" This made no sense under doctrines of independent creation of species, as even Richard Owen had admitted, but the \"explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications\" showing common descent. He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar embryos. Darwin discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in baleen whales, are found only in embryonic stages. These factors also supported his theory of descent with modification.\n\n\n=== Concluding remarks ===\nThe final chapter, \"Recapitulation and Conclusion\", reviews points from earlier chapters, and Darwin concludes by hoping that his theory might produce revolutionary changes in many fields of natural history. He suggests that psychology will be put on a new foundation and implies the relevance of his theory to the first appearance of humanity with the sentence that \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\" Darwin ends with a passage that became well known and much quoted:\n\nIt is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us ... Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\nDarwin added the phrase \"by the Creator\" from the 1860 second edition onwards, so that the ultimate sentence begins \"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\".\n\n\n== Structure, style, and themes ==\n\n\n=== Nature and structure of Darwin's argument ===\nDarwin's aims were twofold: to show that species had not been separately created, and to show that natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar with the concept of transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.\nLater chapters provide evidence that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternative concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, and its ability to explain a wide range of observations. This reflected the influence of William Whewell's idea of a consilience of inductions, as explained in his work Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, where if you could argue that a proposed mechanism successfully explained various phenomena you could then use those arguments as evidence for that mechanism.\n\n\n=== Literary style ===\nThe Examiner review of 3 December 1859 commented, \"Much of Mr. Darwin's volume is what ordinary readers would call 'tough reading;' that is, writing which to comprehend requires concentrated attention and some preparation for the task. All, however, is by no means of this description, and many parts of the book abound in information, easy to comprehend and both instructive and entertaining.\"\nWhile the book was readable enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Though Richard Owen did complain in the Quarterly Review that the style was too easy for a serious work of science. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.\n\n\n=== Human evolution ===\nFrom his early transmutation notebooks in the late 1830s onwards, Darwin considered human evolution as part of the natural processes he was investigating, and rejected divine intervention. In 1856, his \"big book on species\" titled Natural Selection was to include a \"note on Man\", but when Wallace enquired in December 1857, Darwin replied; \"You ask whether I shall discuss 'man';—I think I shall avoid whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest & most interesting problem for the naturalist.\"\nOn 28 March 1859, with his manuscript for the book well under way, Darwin wrote to Lyell offering the suggested publisher John Murray assurances \"That I do not discuss origin of man\".\nIn the final chapter of On the Origin of Species, \"Recapitulation and Conclusion\", Darwin briefly highlights the human implications of his theory:\n\n\"In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"\nDiscussing this in January 1860, Darwin assured Lyell that \"by the sentence [Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history] I show that I believe man is in same predicament with other animals. Many modern writers have seen this sentence as Darwin's only reference to humans in the book; Janet Browne describes it as his only discussion there of human origins, while noting that the book makes other references to humanity.\nSome other statements in the book are quietly effective at pointing out the implication that humans are simply another species, evolving through the same processes and principles affecting other organisms. For example, in Chapter III: \"Struggle for Existence\" Darwin includes \"slow-breeding man\" among other examples of Malthusian population growth. In his discussions on morphology, Darwin compares and comments on bone structures that are homologous between humans and other mammals.\nDarwin's early notebooks discussed how non-adaptive characteristics could be selected when animals or humans chose mates, with races of humans differing over ideas of beauty. In his 1856 notes responding to Robert Knox's The Races of Man: A Fragment, he called this effect sexual selection. He added notes on sexual selection to his \"big book on species\", and in mid-1857 he added a section heading \"Theory applied to Races of Man\", but did not add text on this topic.\nIn On the Origin of Species, Chapter VI: \"Difficulties on Theory\", Darwin mentions this in the context of \"slight and unimportant variations\":\n\nI might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.\"\nWhen Darwin published The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex twelve years later, he said that he had not gone into detail on human evolution in the Origin as he thought that would \"only add to the prejudices against my views\". He had not completely avoided the topic:\n\nIt seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my \"Origin of Species,\" that by this work \"light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;\" and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.\nHe also said that he had \"merely alluded\" in that book to sexual selection differentiating human races.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe book aroused international interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much of the initial reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. Bishop Samuel Wilberforce wrote a review in Quarterly Review in 1860 where he disagreed with Darwin's 'argument'. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term 'Darwinism' was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.\nWhile Darwin had been somewhat coy about human origins, not identifying any explicit conclusion on the matter in his book, he had dropped enough hints about human's animal ancestry for the inference to be made, and the first review claimed it made a creed of the \"men from monkeys\" idea from Vestiges. Human evolution became central to the debate and was strongly argued by Huxley who featured it in his popular \"working-men's lectures\". Darwin did not publish his own views on this until 1871.\nThe naturalism of natural selection conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms 'evolution' and 'survival of the fittest', and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.\n\n\n=== Impact on the scientific community ===\n\nScientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \"law of development\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive idea that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay Archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.\n\nEvolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\" and coining the term \"Darwinism\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late-Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies.\nThe leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \"ordained becoming\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \"creation by birth\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \"Great Hippocampus Question\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \"great hippopotamus test\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871).\n\n\n==== Impact outside Great Britain ====\n\nThe German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond converted to Darwinism after reading an English copy of On the Origin of Species in the spring of 1860. Du Bois-Reymond was a committed supporter, securing Darwin an honorary degree from the University of Breslau, teaching his theory to students at the University of Berlin, and defending his name to paying audiences across Germany and The Netherlands. Du Bois-Reymond's exposition resembled Darwin's: he endorsed natural selection, rejected the inheritance of acquired characters, remained silent on the origin of variation, and identified \"the altruism of bees, the regeneration of tissue, the effects of exercise, and the inheritance of disadvantageous traits\" as puzzles presented by the theory.\nEvolutionary ideas, although not natural selection, were accepted by other German biologists accustomed to ideas of homology in morphology from Goethe's Metamorphosis of Plants and from their long tradition of comparative anatomy. Bronn's alterations in his German translation added to the misgivings of conservatives but encouraged political radicals. Ernst Haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise Darwin's ideas with those of Lamarck and Goethe while still reflecting the spirit of Naturphilosophie. His ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life was joined by Huxley and supported by discoveries in palaeontology. Haeckel used embryology extensively in his recapitulation theory, which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution. Darwin was cautious about such histories, and had already noted that von Baer's laws of embryology supported his idea of complex branching.\nAsa Gray promoted and defended Origin against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably Louis Agassiz, who viewed every species as a distinct fixed unit in the mind of the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties. Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory.\nFrench-speaking naturalists in several countries showed appreciation of the much-modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.\n\n\n==== Challenges to natural selection ====\nThere were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Carl Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that the Sun, and therefore life on Earth, was only about 100 million years old. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the fifth edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.\nBy the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" included forms of \"saltationism\" in which new species were thought to arise through \"jumps\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of August Weismann, that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called neo-Darwinism. It was thought that the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance invalidated Darwin's views.\n\n\n=== Impact on economic and political debates ===\nWhile some, like Spencer, used analogy from natural selection as an argument against government intervention in the economy to benefit the poor, others, including Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities to level the playing field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non-white races and justify European imperialism. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.\n\n\n=== Religious attitudes ===\n\nThe book produced a wide range of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English-speaking world.\nNatural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful. In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \"just as noble a conception of Deity\". In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as \"a celebrated cleric\", and added the phrase \"by the Creator\" to the closing sentence, which from then on read \"life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\". While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted, Darwin's view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature, and even in the first edition there are several references to \"creation\".\nBaden Powell praised \"Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature\". In America, Asa Gray argued that evolution is the secondary effect, or modus operandi, of the first cause, design, and published a pamphlet defending the book in terms of theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with Natural Theology. Theistic evolution became a popular compromise, and St. George Jackson Mivart was among those accepting evolution but attacking Darwin's naturalistic mechanism. Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as neo-Lamarckism were favoured over natural selection as being more compatible with purpose.\nEven though the book did not explicitly spell out Darwin's beliefs about human origins, it had dropped a number of hints about human's animal ancestry and quickly became central to the debate, as mental and moral qualities were seen as spiritual aspects of the immaterial soul, and it was believed that animals did not have spiritual qualities. This conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans, or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind's position at the head of nature. While many conservative theologians accepted evolution, Charles Hodge argued in his 1874 critique \"What is Darwinism?\" that \"Darwinism\", defined narrowly as including rejection of design, was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design. Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin's text. By the early 20th century, four noted authors of The Fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution, but fundamentalism inspired the American creation–evolution controversy that began in the 1920s. Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century, but other Catholic writers, starting with Mivart, pointed out that early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area. The English cardinal John Henry Newman stated in a letter that “… Darwin's theory need not then to be atheistical, be it true or not; it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of Divine Prescience and Skill.” The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical, which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching.\n\n\n== Modern influence ==\n\nVarious alternative evolutionary mechanisms favoured during \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" became untenable as more was learned about inheritance and mutation. The full significance of natural selection was at last accepted in the 1930s and 1940s as part of the modern evolutionary synthesis. During that synthesis biologists and statisticians, including R. A. Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane, merged Darwinian selection with a statistical understanding of Mendelian genetics.\nModern evolutionary theory continues to develop. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geological record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.\nInterest in Darwin's writings continues, and scholars have generated an extensive literature, the Darwin Industry, about his life and work. The text of Origin itself has been subject to much analysis including a variorum, detailing the changes made in every edition, first published in 1959, and a concordance, an exhaustive external index published in 1981. Worldwide commemorations of the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species and the bicentenary of Darwin's birth were scheduled for 2009. They celebrated the ideas which \"over the last 150 years have revolutionised our understanding of nature and our place within it\".\nIn a survey conducted by a group of academic booksellers, publishers and librarians in advance of Academic Book Week in the United Kingdom, On the Origin of Species was voted the most influential academic book ever written. It was hailed as \"the supreme demonstration of why academic books matter\" and \"a book which has changed the way we think about everything\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCharles Darwin bibliography\nThe Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online\nThe Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, published in 1871; his second major book on evolutionary theory.\nHistory of biology\nHistory of evolutionary thought\nHistory of speciation\nModern evolutionary synthesis\nTransmutation of species\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nBrowne, Janet (2007), Darwin's Origin of Species: A Biography, Grove Press, ISBN 978-0-87113-953-5\nMalthus, Thomas Robert (1826), An Essay on the Principle of Population: A View of its Past and Present Effects on Human Happiness; with an Inquiry into Our Prospects Respecting the Future Removal or Mitigation of the Evils which It Occasions, vol. 1 (6th ed.), London: John Murray, retrieved 13 November 2017 (Vol. 2)\nReznick, David N.

The book includes some suggestions of his ideas, particularly in the second edition of 1845.\n\n\n== Context ==\nIn May 1826 two ships left Plymouth to survey the southern coasts of South America. The senior officer of the expedition was Phillip Parker King, Commander and Surveyor of HMS Adventure, and under his orders Pringle Stokes was Commander and Surveyor of HMS Beagle. In August 1828 Stokes died after shooting himself. In December Robert FitzRoy was given command of the ship and continued the survey. In January 1830 FitzRoy noted in his journal the need for expertise in mineralogy or geology, on a future expedition he would \"endeavour to carry out a person qualified to examine the land; while the officers, and myself, would attend to hydrography.\" Both ships returned to Plymouth in August 1830. King was in poor health, and retired from the Navy (he moved back to his home in Australia in 1832).\nIn August 1831, while Beagle was being readied, FitzRoy's offer of a place for a self-funded naturalist was raised with University of Cambridge professors. Henslow passed it on to Darwin who was well qualified and, enthused by reading Humboldt's Personal Narrative, was on a short study tour with geologist Adam Sedgwick in preparation for a planned visit with friends to Tenerife. Darwin read the letters when he got home, and was eager to join the voyage.\n\n\n=== Darwin's diary / journal ===\nOn board the ship, Darwin began a day-to-day record of activities in the form of a diary, which he commonly called \"my Journal\". Darwin wrote entries, in ink, while on the ship or when staying for a period in a house on shore. When travelling on land, he left the manuscript on the ship, and made pencil notes in pocket books to record details of his excursions along with his field notes on geology and natural history. He then wrote up his diary entries from these notes or from memory, sometimes several weeks after the event.\nPages 1 and 2, dated 16 December 1831, outline events from Darwin arriving home on 29 August to his arrival at Devonport on 24 October. From page 3 onwards he adopts a consistent layout, with month, the year and place in a heading at the top, page number in a top corner, and the day of the month in the margin at each entry. After delays and false starts due to weather, they set off on 27 December. Darwin suffered seasickness, and his entry for that date starts \"I am now on the 5th of Jan.y writing the memoranda of my misery for the last week\".\nIn April, a month after reaching South America, he wrote to his sister Caroline that he was struggling to write letters, partly due to \"writing everything in my journal\". A few weeks later at Botafogo in Rio de Janeiro, tired and short of time, he sent her \"in a packet, my commonplace Journal.— I have taken a fit of disgust with it & want to get it out of my sight, any of you that like may read it.— a great deal is absolutely childish: Remember however this, that it is written solely to make me remember this voyage, & that it is not a record of facts but of my thoughts\". He invited criticisms. In reply, his sister Catherine praised his \"interesting and entertaining\" descriptions,  \"Susan read the Journal aloud to Papa, who was interested, and liked it very much\". His Wedgwood relatives had asked to see it at Maer Hall. Darwin left that \"entirely in your hands.— I suspect the first part is abominaly childish, if so do not send it to Maer.— Also, do not send it by the Coach, (it may appear ridiculous to you) but I would as soon loose a piece of my memory as it.— I feel it is of such consequence to my preserving a just recollection of the different places we visit.\"\nBy 14 July 1833 Darwin had sent more of his diary. On 28 October Caroline gave the requested critical assessment – in the first part Darwin had \"probably from reading so much of Humboldt, got his phraseology & occasionally made use of the kind of flowery French expressions which he uses, instead of your own simple straight forward & far more agreeable style. I have no doubt you have without perceiving it got to embody your ideas in his poetical language & from his being a foreigner it does not sound unnatural in him\". However, \"the greatest part I liked exceedingly & could find no fault\". In July 1834, Darwin agreed that these points were \"perfectly just\", and continued to update his diary carefully.\nAs Beagle headed homewards in April 1836,  Darwin told Caroline that FitzRoy too was busy with writing \"the account of the Voyage\". This \"Book\" might be \"rather diffuse\", but otherwise good: \"his style is very simple & excellent. He has proposed to me, to join him in publishing the account, that is, for him to have the disposal & arranging of my journal & to mingle it with his own. Of course I have said I am perfectly willing, if he wants materials; or thinks the chit-chat details of my journal are any ways worth publishing. He has read over the part, I have on board, & likes it.\" Darwin asked his family about this idea, but would be aware the custom of the Navy was that the captain had a right to first use of papers.\n\n\n=== Journal and remarks ===\nSoon after Darwin's return, he was at a party hosted by Fanny and Hensleigh Wedgwood for their relatives on 4 December 1836. They agreed to review his journal. The physician and travel writer Henry Holland looked at some pages and \"thought that it would not be worth while to publish it alone, as it would be partly going over the same ground with the Captain\", leaving Darwin \"more perplexed\" but \"becoming rather inclined to the plan of mixing up long passages with Capt Fitzroy.\" He would \"go on with the geology and let the journal take care of itself\", but Emma Wedgwood did not think Holland \"any judge as to what is amusing or interesting\", and like Catherine thought it should be published by itself, not \"mixed up with Capt. FitzRoy's\". Fanny and Hensleigh found the \"Journal so interesting, that it is quite difficult to stop to criticize\". Though \"not in general a good reader of travels\", he \"found no part of yours tedious.\" They had \"read a great deal of it aloud too\" as a more severe test, and concluded it had \"more variety and a greater number of interesting portions\" than other travel books, \"the less it is mixed up with the Captains the better.\" \nAfter advice from Broderip, FitzRoy wrote on 30 December that \"One volume might be for King—another for you—and a third for me. The profits if any, to be divided into three equal portions—What think you of such a plan?\" Darwin agreed, and began work on his volume. In March he told Fox \"I am now hard at work and give up every thing else for it. Our plan is as follows.— Capt. FitzRoy writes two volumes, out of the materials collected during both the last voyage under Capt. King to T. del Fuego and during our circumnavigation.— I am to have the third volume, in which I intend giving a kind of journal of a naturalist, not following however always the order of time, but rather the order of position.— The habits of animals will occupy a large portion, sketches of the geology, the appearance of the country, and personal details will make the hodge-podge complete.— Afterwards I shall write an account of the geology in detail, and draw up some Zoological papers.— So that I have plenty of work, for the next year or two, and till that is finished I will have no holidays.\"\n\n\n== Publication of FitzRoy's narrative and Darwin's book ==\nDarwin reorganised his diary, trimmed parts, and incorporated scientific material from his field notes. He passed his writing to the publisher Henry Colburn, and in August 1837 had the first proofs back from the printer. Henslow helped check them; on 4 November, Darwin wrote to him that \"If I live till I am eighty years old I shall not cease to marvel at finding myself an author\". Part of it was printed, \"the smooth paper and clear type has a charming appearance, and I sat the other evening gazing in silent admiration at the first page of my own volume, when I received it from the printers!\"\nFitzRoy had to edit King's account of the first voyage, adding extracts from the journal of the previous captain of Beagle and his own journal when he took over, as well as write his own account of the second voyage. In mid-November 1837, he took offence that Darwin's preface to volume III (and a similar preface to the first part of The Zoology) lacked, in his view, enough acknowledgement of the help given by FitzRoy and other officers; the problem was overcome. By the end of February 1838, King's Narrative (volumes I) and Darwin's Journal (volume III) had been printed, but FitzRoy was still hard at work on volume II.\nThe Narrative was completed and published as a four-volume set in May 1839, as the Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle, describing their Examination of the Southern Shores of South America, and the Beagle's Circumnavigation of the Globe, in three volumes. Volume one covers the first voyage under Commander Phillip Parker King, volume two is FitzRoy's account of the second voyage. Darwin's Journal and Remarks, 1832–1835 forms the third volume, and the fourth volume is a lengthy appendix. The publication was reviewed as a whole by Basil Hall in the July 1839 issue of the Edinburgh Review. \nVolume two includes FitzRoy's Remarks with reference to the Deluge in which he recanted his earlier interest in the geological writings of Charles Lyell and his remarks to Darwin during the expedition that sedimentary features they saw \"could never have been effected by a forty days' flood\", asserting his renewed commitment to a literal reading of the Bible. He had married on the ship's return, and his wife was very religious.\nDarwin's contribution proved remarkably popular and the publisher, Henry Colburn of London, announced on 15 August a separate volume of Darwin's text, published with a new title page as Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the various countries visited by H.M.S. Beagle. The Publishers‘ Circular of 2 September carried an advertisement for this volume, as well as a separate advertisement for the other volumes, as listed at William Broderip's article in the Quarterly Review. This was apparently done without seeking Darwin's permission or paying him a fee.\n\n\n=== Second edition: changing ideas on evolution ===\n\nThe second edition of 1845 incorporated extensive revisions made in the light of interpretation of the field collections and developing ideas on evolution. This edition was commissioned by the publisher John Murray, who actually paid Darwin a fee of £150 for the copyright. The full title was modified to Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology of the countries visited during the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle round the world.\nIn the first edition, Darwin remarks in regard to the similarity of Galápagos wildlife to that on the South American continent, \"The circumstance would be explained, according to the views of some authors, by saying that the creative power had acted according to the same law over a wide area\". (This was written in a reference to Charles Lyell's ideas of \"centres of creation\".) Darwin notes the gradations in size of the beaks of species of finches, suspects that species \"are confined to different islands\", \"But there is not space in this work, to enter into this curious subject.\"\nLater editions hint at his new ideas on evolution:\n\nConsidering the small size of these islands, we feel the more astonished at the number of their aboriginal beings, and at their confined range... within a period geologically recent the unbroken ocean was here spread out. Hence, both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact – that mystery of mysteries – the first appearance of new beings on this earth.\nSpeaking of the finches with their gradations in size of beaks, he writes \"one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\"\nIn 1890, John Murray published an illustrated edition of the book, at the suggestion of the artist Robert Taylor Pritchett, who was already known for accompanying voyages of the RYS Wanderer and Sunbeam, and producing pictures used in books on these cruises. In his foreword to this edition of Journal and Researches, Murray said that most \"of the views given in this work are from sketches made on the spot by Mr. Pritchett, with Mr. Darwin's book by his side\", and the illustrations had been \"chosen and verified with the utmost care and pains\".\n\n\n== Contents – places Darwin visited ==\nFor readability, the chapters of the book are arranged geographically rather than in an exact chronological sequence of places Darwin visited or revisited. The main headings (and in some cases subheadings) of each chapter give a good idea of where he went, but not the exact sequence. See second voyage of HMS Beagle for a detailed synopsis of Darwin's travels. The contents list in the book also notes topics discussed in each chapter, not shown here for simplicity. Names and spellings are those used by Darwin. The list below is based on the Journal and Remarks of 1839.\n\nPreface\nChapter I: St. Jago–Cape de Verde Islands (St. Paul's Rocks, Fernando Noronha, 20 Feb.., Bahia, or San Salvador, Brazil, 29 Feb..)\nChapter II: Rio de Janeiro\nChapter III: Maldonado\nChapter IV: Río Negro to Bahia Blanca\nChapter V: Bahía Blanca\nChapter VI: Bahia Blanca to Buenos Aires\nChapter VII: Buenos Aires to St. Fe\nChapter VIII: Banda Oriental\nChapter IX: Patagonia\nChapter X: Santa Cruz–Patagonia\nChapter XI: Tierra del Fuego\nChapter XII: The Falkland Islands\nChapter XIII: Strait of Magellan\nChapter XIV: Central Chile\nChapter XV: Chiloe and Chonos Islands\nChapter XVI: Chiloe and Concepcion\nChapter XVII: Passage of Cordillera\nChapter XVIII: Northern Chile and Peru\nChapter XIX: Galapagos Archipelago\nChapter XX: Tahiti and New Zealand\nChapter XXI: Australia (Van Diemen's Land)\nChapter XXII: Coral Formations (Keeling or Cocos Islands)\nChapter XXIII: Mauritius to England\nIn the second edition, the Journal of Researches of 1845, chapters VIII and IX were merged into a new chapter VIII on \"Banda Oriental and Patagonia\", and chapter IX now included \"Santa Cruz, Patagonia and The Falkland Islands\". After chapter X on Tierra del Fuego, chapter XI had the revised heading \"Strait of Magellan–Climate of the Southern Coasts\". The following chapters were renumbered accordingly. Chapter XIV was given the revised heading \"Chiloe and Concepcion: Great Earthquake\", and chapter XX had the heading \"Keeling Island:–Coral Formations\", with the concluding chapter XXI keeping the heading \"Mauritius to England\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDarwin, Charles (June 1960), \"Darwin as a Traveller\", The Geographical Journal, 126 (2): 129–136, Bibcode:1960GeogJ.126..129D, doi:10.2307/1793952, JSTOR 1793952 Retrieved on 15 December 2006\nBrowne, E.

He perceives separate features of objects, but cannot correctly identify them or the whole objects that they are part of. At first he supposes that diabetes has affected his vision, but an ophthalmologist suspects a neurological problem and refers him to Sacks. As he leaves Sacks' examination room during his first visit, he momentarily grabs his wife's head, supposing it to be his hat. Unable to treat Dr. P.'s problem, Sacks encourages him to focus on his musical interests, which remain intact.\n\"The Lost Mariner\", about Jimmie G., who has anterograde amnesia (the loss of the ability to form new memories) and retrograde amnesia (inability to access memories or information from before the disease occurred) due to atypical Korsakoff syndrome acquired after a rather heavy episode of alcoholism in 1970. He can remember nothing of his life since the end of World War II, including events that happened only a few minutes ago. Occasionally, he can recall a few fragments of his life between 1945 and 1970, such as when he sees \"satellite\" in a headline and subsequently remarks about a satellite tracking job he had that could have occurred only in the 1960s. He believes it is still 1945 (the segment covers his life in the 1970s and early 1980s), and seems to behave as a normal, intelligent young man aside from his inability to remember most of his past and the events of his day-to-day life. He struggles to find meaning, satisfaction, and happiness in the midst of constantly forgetting what he is doing from one moment to the next.\n\"The President's Speech\", about a ward of aphasiacs and agnosiacs listening to a speech given by an unnamed actor-president, \"the old charmer\", presumably Ronald Reagan. Many of them laughed at the speech, while others were shocked. Sacks observes that while aphasiacs struggle with words, they can understand natural speech, because the words are paired with other expressive cues. They are acutely aware when the words and cues do not match. The agnosiacs perceived the president's words without understanding them, and found them illogically structured, with one remarking that \"he does not speak good prose.\"\n\"The Disembodied Lady\", a unique case of a woman losing her entire sense of proprioception (the sense of the position of parts of the body, relative to other neighboring parts of the body), due to acute polyneuropathy. Over the course of months, she learns to control her body by visual feedback alone.\n\"The Man Who Fell out of Bed\" is about a young man whom Dr. Sacks sees as a medical student. Sacks encounters the patient on the floor of his hospital room, where he tells Sacks that he woke up to find a strange leg in his bed. Assuming that one of the nurses had played a prank on him, he attempted to toss the leg out of bed, only to find that he was attached to it. Although Sacks attempts to persuade the patient that the leg is his own, he remains bewildered in an apparent case of somatoparaphrenia.\n\"Hands\" describes the case of Madeline J., a 60-year-old blind woman with cerebral palsy who had never used her hands functionally, and referred to them as \"useless lumps of dough.\" Sacks theorized that her inability was not due to incapacity but to lifelong neglect, which had prevented motor development. With encouragement and training, she gradually learned to use her hands and eventually began sculpting, revealing significant artistic ability.\n\"Phantoms\" explores how the brain's representation of the body can persist even after physical loss, highlighting the mysterious and powerful ways our nervous system constructs bodily awareness. The story serves as an introduction to the complex relationship between physical reality and neural perception.\n\"On the Level\", another case involving damaged proprioception. Dr. Sacks interviews a patient who has trouble walking upright and discovers that he has lost his innate sense of balance due to Parkinson's-like symptoms that have damaged his inner ears; the patient, comparing his sense of balance to a carpenter's spirit level, suggested constructing a similar level inside a pair of glasses. This enables him to judge his balance by sight and after a few weeks, the task of keeping his eye on the level became less tiring.\n\"Eyes Right!\", about a woman in her sixties who has hemispatial neglect. She completely forgets the idea of \"left\" relative to her own body and the world around her. When nurses place food or drink on her left side, she fails to recognize that they are there. Dr. Sacks attempts to show the patient the left side of her body using a video screen setup; when the patient sees the left side of her body, on her right, she is overwhelmed with anxiety and asks for it to stop.\nPart Two:\n\n\"Witty Ticcy Ray\" tells the story of Ray, a man with Tourette syndrome, whose tics disrupted his life but also fueled his creativity as a jazz drummer. After some trial and error, Dr. Sacks helps Ray find an optimal medication schedule that balances control and self-expression.\n\"Cupid's Disease\", about an elderly woman whose mild neurosyphilis causes increased energy and flirtatiousness. Sacks reflects on how neurological conditions can sometimes enhance mood and personality.\n\"A Matter of Identity\", focusing on a man with Korsakoff's syndrome, a condition causing severe memory loss. Unable to form new memories, he constantly invents fictional identities and stories to make sense of his surroundings. The chapter explores how memory shapes identity and how the mind tries to maintain coherence even when memory fails.\n\"Yes, Father-Sister\", about a woman with fluent but nonsensical speech. It illustrates how language can remain grammatically intact while losing meaning.\n\"The Possessed\", about a woman with Tourette's syndrome. She experiences uncontrollable tics and vocalizations, but also remarkable creativity and energy. The chapter explores the complex relationship between neurological disorder, personality, and artistic expression.\nPart Three:\n\n\"Reminiscence\" discusses the case of two elderly women who experience auditory hallucinations—one hearing childhood songs, the other perceiving noises such as ringing, hissing, or rumbling. Neurological examination links the episodes to temporal-lobe seizure activity, with the hallucinations drawing on memories that carry strong personal and emotional associations.\n“Incontinent Nostalgia” briefly discusses patients whose long-buried memories and emotions reawakened after treatment with L-Dopa, revealing how the past endures in the brain and how it can be “activated under special conditions.”\n\"The Dog Beneath the Skin\", concerning a 22-year-old medical student, \"Stephen D.\", who, after a night under the influence of amphetamines, cocaine, and PCP, wakes to find he has a tremendously heightened sense of smell. Sacks would reveal many years later that he, in fact, was Stephen D.\nPart Four:\n\n\"Rebecca\", about a young woman with a congenital intellectual disability, likely related to developmental disorders. Despite her low IQ and struggles with conventional learning, she possesses a deep emotional intelligence, creativity, and an intuitive understanding of social and artistic expression. While traditional testing and assessments label her as severely limited, Sacks observes that Rebecca flourishes in artistic and imaginative spaces, such as theater and storytelling. When placed in an environment where emotional and social intelligence matter more than logic and structured learning, she demonstrates profound abilities that defy her clinical diagnosis.\n\"The Twins\", about autistic savants. Dr. Sacks meets twin brothers who can neither read nor perform multiplication, yet are playing a \"game\" of finding very large prime numbers. While the twins were able to spontaneously generate these numbers, from six to twenty digits, Sacks had to resort to a book of prime numbers to join in with them. The twins also instantly count 111 dropped matches, simultaneously remarking that 111 is three 37s. This story has been questioned by Makoto Yamaguchi, who doubts that a book of large prime numbers could exist as described, and points out that reliable scientific reports support only approximate perception when rapidly counting large numbers of items. Autistic savant Daniel Tammet points out that the twins provided the matchbox and may have counted its contents beforehand, noting that he finds the value of 111 to be \"particularly beautiful and matchstick-like\".\n\"The Autist Artist\", about a 21-year-old named Jose who had been deemed \"hopelessly retarded\" and had seizures; however, when given Sacks' pocket watch and asked to draw it, he composed himself and drew the watch in surprising detail.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nChristopher Rawlence wrote the libretto for a chamber opera—directed by Michael Morris with music by Michael Nyman—based on the title story. The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat was first produced by the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1986. A television version of the opera was subsequently broadcast in the UK.\nPeter Brook adapted Sacks's book into an acclaimed theatrical production, L'Homme Qui..., which premiered at the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, Paris, in 1993. An Indian theatre company performed a play entitled The Blue Mug, based on the book, starring Rajat Kapoor, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ranvir Shorey, and Vinay Pathak.\nThe Man Who, an album by the Scottish indie pop band Travis, is named after this book.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAn Anthropologist on Mars, 1995 Sacks book\nProprioception\nAphasia\nBlindsight\nHemispatial neglect\nV.

He is the author of the New York Times Best Seller The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate, which was translated from German into English in 2016.",
    "full_narrative": "Peter Wohlleben (born 1964) is a German forester and author who writes on ecological themes in popular language and has controversially argued for plant sentience. He is the author of the New York Times Best Seller The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate, which was translated from German into English in 2016.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter graduation from forestry school in Rottenburg am Neckar, Germany, he took up a job as a government wood ranger in the Rhineland-Palatinate in 1987. As he grew more familiar with the woodlands he was overseeing, he became disenchanted due to the damage caused by the techniques and technologies he was expected to employ, including the felling of mature trees and the use of insecticides.\nProfessionally, Wohlleben manages a beech forest on behalf of the municipality of Hümmel, Germany. He offers regular forest tours at his forest academy.\nWhile Wohlleben advocates for animal welfare and has raised awareness about the treatment of animals, and has stated that \"It's okay to eat plants. It's okay to eat meat, although I'm a vegetarian, because meat is the main forest killer. But if plants are conscious about what they are doing, it's okay to eat them. Because otherwise we will die. And it's our right to survive.”, he has also controversially argued that plants feel pain.\n\n\n== Writing career ==\nWohlleben began publishing books popularizing scientific research about ecology and forest management in 2007. The appearance of his Das geheime Leben der Bäume through Random House's Ludwig imprint led to profiles and reviews in all the major German newspapers, including skeptical pieces in the business press. The book was featured in a cover story in Der Spiegel and appeared on the Spiegel bestseller list.\nHis 2012 book Kranichflug und Blumenuhr, was translated as The Weather Detective: Rediscovering Nature's Secret Signs in 2018. The Secret Wisdom of Nature: Trees, Animals, and the Extraordinary Balance of All Living Things – Stories from Science and Observation was released in 2019. Wohlleben's first book for children available in English was published in October 2019. Called Can You Hear the Trees Talking?: Discovering The Hidden Life of Forests, it is a young readers' edition of The Hidden Life of Trees.\n\n\n=== The Hidden Life of Trees ===\nHis 2015 book about natural forests, Das geheime Leben der Bäume:Was sie fühlen, wie sie kommunizieren – die Entdeckung einer verborgenen Welt, (The Hidden Life of Trees: What they Feel, How they Communicate: Discoveries from a Secret World) introduces readers to the world of trees, including Wood-Wide Web, through which nutrition and signals are exchanged among trees. An English translation was published in September 2016 under the title The Hidden Life of Trees: What they Feel, How they Communicate with a foreword by Australian environmentalist Tim Flannery, published by Greystone Books in partnership with the David Suzuki Institute. It cites the research of Suzanne Simard. The book was widely criticized by biologists and forest scientists for using strong anthropomorphic and teleological language such as describing trees as having friendships and registering fear, love and pain. It has been described as containing a \"conglomeration of half-truths, biased judgements, and wishful thinking\".\nA documentary film Intelligent Trees features several of Wohlleben's observations. He appears alongside Suzanne Simard, a professor of forest ecology at the University of British Columbia, who has been doing research on interactions among trees through micorrhizal networks since 1997.\nA second documentary film was released under the title The Hidden Life of Trees in theaters in the United States. It had its UK premiere at the 2021 Wales One World Film Festival, which was presented online owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n=== The Inner Life of Animals ===\nIn 2016, Wohlleben authored Das Seelenleben der Tiere, which was translated into English and published under the title The Inner Life of Animals: Love, Grief, and Compassion—Surprising Observations of a Hidden World in 2017. The book argues for animal sentience. It contains 41 short chapters with examples of animals exhibiting emotions such as courage, desire, grief, love and regret.\n\n\n=== The Power of Trees ===\nWohlleben's 2023 book explores the role of ancient forests in combating climate change, and how forest management practices have impaired forests' natural functions. \"The future of forests and the future of humanity are inextricably entwined,\" he writes in the introduction, crediting trees for their ability to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, cool the local climate and increase rainfall.\n\n\n== Major works ==\nThe Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World (Greystone Books, 2015)\nThe Inner Life of Animals: Love, Grief, and Compassion: Surprising Observations of a Hidden World (Greystone Books, 2016)\nThe Secret Wisdom of Nature: Trees, Animals, and the Extraordinary Balance of All Living Things ― Stories from Science and Observation (Greystone Books, 2017)\nCan You Hear the Trees Talking?: Discovering The Hidden Life of the Forest (Greystone Kids, 2019)\nPeter and the Tree Children (Greystone Kids, 2020)\nThe Heartbeat of Trees: Embracing Our Ancient Bond with Forests and Nature (Greystone Books, 2021)\nThe Power of Trees: How Ancient Forests Can Save Us if We Let Them (Greystone Books, 2023)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Trailer \"Intelligent Trees\"  featuring Peter Wohlleben and Suzanne Simard\nThe Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben Book by goodbooksummary.com",

The book was a New York Times bestseller and was the 2012 winner of the National Academies Communication Award for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics in behavioral science, engineering and medicine. The integrity of some priming studies cited in the book has been called into question in the midst of the psychological replication crisis.\n\n\n== Two systems ==\nIn the book's first section, Kahneman describes two different ways the brain forms thoughts:\n\nSystem 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious.  Examples (in order of complexity) of things system 1 can do:\ndetermine that an object is at a greater distance than another\nlocalize the source of a specific sound\ncomplete a common phrase (e.g. \"war and ...\")\ndisplay disgust when seeing a gruesome image\nsolve basic arithmetic (e.g. 2 + 2 = ?)\nread text on a billboard\ndrive a car on an empty road\nthink of a good chess move (if one is a chess master)\nunderstand simple sentences\nSystem 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious.  Examples of things system 2 can do:\nprepare for the start of a sprint\ndirect attention towards certain people in a crowded environment\nlook for a person with a particular feature\ntry to recognize a sound\nsustain a faster-than-normal walking rate\ndetermine the appropriateness of a particular action in a social setting\ncount the number of A's or other letters in a given text\ngive one's own telephone number to someone else\npark into a tight parking space\ndetermine the price/quality ratio of two products\ndetermine the validity of a complex logical reasoning\nmultiply two-digit numbers (e.g. 17 × 24)\nKahneman describes a number of experiments which purport to examine the differences between these two thought systems and how they arrive at different results even given the same inputs. Terms and concepts include coherence, attention, laziness, association, jumping to conclusions, WYSIATI (What you see is all there is), and how one forms judgments. The System 1 vs. System 2 debate includes the reasoning or lack thereof for human decision making, with big implications for many areas including law and market research.\n\n\n== Heuristics and biases ==\n\nThe second section offers explanations for why humans struggle to think statistically. It begins by documenting a variety of situations in which we either arrive at binary decisions or fail to associate precisely reasonable probabilities with outcomes. Kahneman explains this phenomenon using the theory of heuristics. Kahneman and Tversky originally discussed this topic in their 1974 article titled Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.\nKahneman uses heuristics to assert that System 1 thinking involves associating new information with existing patterns, or thoughts, rather than creating new patterns for each new experience. For example, a child who has only seen shapes with straight edges might perceive an octagon when first viewing a circle. As a legal metaphor, a judge limited to heuristic thinking would only be able to think of similar historical cases when presented with a new dispute, rather than considering the unique aspects of that case. In addition to offering an explanation for the statistical problem, the theory also offers an explanation for human biases.\n\n\n=== Anchoring ===\n\nThe \"anchoring effect\" names a tendency to be influenced by irrelevant numbers. Shown greater/lesser numbers, experimental subjects gave greater/lesser responses. As an example, most people, when asked whether Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died, will provide a much greater estimate of his age at death than others who were asked whether Gandhi was more or less than 35 years old. Experiments show that people's behavior is influenced, much more than they are aware, by irrelevant information.\n\n\n=== Availability ===\n\nThe availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that occurs when people make judgments about the probability of events on the basis of how easy it is to think of examples. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that, \"if you can think of it, it must be important\". The availability of consequences associated with an action is related positively to perceptions of the magnitude of the consequences of that action. In other words, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something, the greater we perceive these consequences to be. Sometimes, this heuristic is beneficial, but the frequencies at which events come to mind are usually not accurate representations of the probabilities of such events in real life.\n\n\n=== Conjunction fallacy ===\nSystem 1 is prone to substituting a simpler question for a difficult one. In what Kahneman terms their \"best-known and most controversial\"  experiment, \"the Linda problem\", subjects were told about an imaginary Linda, young, single, outspoken, and intelligent, who, as a student, was very concerned with discrimination and social justice. They asked whether it was more probable that Linda is a bank teller or that she is a bank teller and an active feminist. The overwhelming response was that \"feminist bank teller\" was more likely than \"bank teller\", violating the laws of probability. (All feminist bank tellers are bank tellers, so the former can't be more likely). In this case System 1 substituted the easier question, \"Is Linda a feminist?\", neglecting the occupation qualifier. An alternative interpretation is that the subjects added an unstated cultural implicature to the effect that the other answer implied an exclusive or, that Linda was not a feminist.\n\n\n=== Optimism and loss aversion ===\nKahneman writes of a \"pervasive optimistic bias\", which \"may well be the most significant of the cognitive biases.\" This bias generates the illusion of control: the illusion that we have substantial control of our lives.\nA natural experiment reveals the prevalence of one kind of unwarranted optimism. The planning fallacy is the tendency to overestimate benefits and underestimate costs, impelling people to begin risky projects. In 2002, American kitchen remodeling was expected on average to cost $18,658, but actually cost $38,769.\nTo explain overconfidence, Kahneman introduces the concept he terms What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI). This theory states that when the mind makes decisions, it deals primarily with Known Knowns, phenomena it has  observed already. It rarely considers Known Unknowns, phenomena that it knows to be relevant but about which it does not have information. Finally it appears oblivious to the possibility of Unknown Unknowns, unknown phenomena of unknown relevance.\nHe explains that humans fail to take into account complexity and that their understanding of the world consists of a small and necessarily un-representative set of observations. Furthermore, the mind generally does not account for the role of chance and therefore falsely assumes that a future event will be similar to a past event.\n\n\n=== Framing ===\n\nFraming is the context in which choices are presented. Experiment: subjects were asked whether they would opt for surgery if the \"survival\" rate is 90 percent, while others were told that the mortality rate is 10 percent. The first framing increased acceptance, even though the situation was no different.\n\n\n=== Sunk cost ===\n\nRather than consider the odds that an incremental investment would produce a positive return, people tend to \"throw good money after bad\" and continue investing in projects with poor prospects that have already consumed significant resources. In part this is to avoid feelings of regret.\n\n\n== Overconfidence ==\n\nThis part (part III, sections 19–24) of the book is dedicated to the undue confidence in what the mind believes it knows. It suggests that people often overestimate how much they understand about the world and underestimate the role of chance in particular. This is related to the excessive certainty of hindsight, when an event seems to be understood after it has occurred or developed. Kahneman's opinions concerning overconfidence are influenced by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.\n\n\n== Choices ==\nIn this section Kahneman returns to economics and expands his seminal work on Prospect Theory. He discusses the tendency for problems to be addressed in isolation and how, when other reference points are considered, the choice of that reference point (called a frame) has a disproportionate effect on the outcome. This section also offers advice on how some of the shortcomings of System 1 thinking can be avoided.\n\n\n=== Prospect theory ===\nKahneman developed prospect theory, the basis for his Nobel prize, to account for experimental errors he noticed in Daniel Bernoulli's traditional utility theory. According to Kahneman, Utility Theory makes logical assumptions of economic rationality that do not represent people's actual choices, and does not take into account cognitive biases.\nOne example is that people are loss-averse: they are more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve a gain. Another example is that the value people place on a change in probability (e.g., of winning something) depends on the reference point: people seem to place greater value on a change from 0% to 10% (going from impossibility to possibility) than from, say, 45% to 55%, and they place the greatest value of all on a change from 90% to 100% (going from possibility to certainty). This occurs despite the fact that by traditional utility theory all three changes give the same increase in utility. Consistent with loss-aversion, the order of the first and third of those is reversed when the event is presented as losing rather than winning something: there, the greatest value is placed on eliminating the probability of a loss to 0.\nAfter the book's publication, the Journal of Economic Literature published a discussion of its parts concerning prospect theory, as well as an analysis of the four fundamental factors on which it is based.\n\n\n== Two selves ==\nThe fifth part of the book describes recent evidence which introduces a distinction between two selves, the 'experiencing self' and 'remembering self'. Kahneman proposed an alternative measure that assessed pleasure or pain sampled from moment to moment, and then summed over time. Kahneman termed this \"experienced\" well-being and attached it to a separate \"self\". He distinguished this from the \"remembered\" well-being that the polls had attempted to measure. He found that these two measures of happiness diverged.\n\n\n=== Life as a story ===\nThe author's significant discovery was that the remembering self does not care about the duration of a pleasant or unpleasant experience. Instead, it retrospectively rates an experience by the maximum or minimum of the experience, and by the way it ends. The remembering self dominated the patient's ultimate conclusion.\n\n\"Odd as it may seem,\" Kahneman writes, \"I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me.\"\n\n\n=== Experienced well-being ===\nKahneman first began the study of well-being in the 1990s. At the time most happiness research relied on polls about life satisfaction. Having previously studied unreliable memories, the author was doubtful that life satisfaction was a good indicator of happiness. He designed a question that emphasized instead the well-being of the experiencing self. The author proposed that \"Helen was happy in the month of March\" if she spent most of her time engaged in activities that she would rather continue than stop, little time in situations that she wished to escape, and not too much time in a neutral state that wouldn't prefer continuing or stopping the activity either way.\n\n\n=== Thinking about life ===\n\nKahneman suggests that emphasizing a life event such as a marriage or a new car can provide a distorted illusion of its true value. This \"focusing illusion\" revisits earlier ideas of substituting difficult questions and WYSIATI.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2011 Los Angeles Times Book Prize (Current Interest)\nNational Academy of Sciences Best Book Award in 2012\nThe New York Times Book Review, one of the best books of 2011\nGlobe and Mail Best Books of the Year 2011\nOne of The Economist's 2011 Books of the Year\nOne of The Wall Street Journal's Best Nonfiction Books of the Year 2011\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAs of 2012 the book had sold over one million copies. On the year of its publication, it was on the New York Times Bestseller List. The book was reviewed in media  including the Huffington Post, The Guardian, The New York Times,  The Financial Times, The Independent, Bloomberg and The New York Review of Books.\nThe book was also widely reviewed in academic journals, including the Journal of Economic Literature, American Journal of Education, The American Journal of Psychology, Planning Theory, The American Economist, The Journal of Risk and Insurance, The Michigan Law Review, American Scientist, Contemporary Sociology, Science, Contexts, The Wilson Quarterly, Technical Communication, The University of Toronto Law Journal, A Review of General Semantics and Scientific American Mind.\nThe book was also reviewed in a monthly magazine Observer, published by the Association for Psychological Science.\nThe book has achieved a large following among baseball scouts and baseball executives. The ways of thinking described in the book are believed to help scouts, who have to make major judgements off little information and can easily fall into prescriptive yet inaccurate patterns of analysis.\nThe last chapter of Paul Bloom's Against Empathy discusses concepts also touched in Daniel Kahneman's book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, that suggest people make a series of rational and irrational decisions. He criticizes the argument that \"regardless of reason's virtues, we just aren't any good at it.\" His point is that people are not as \"stupid as scholars think they are.\" He explains that people are rational because they make thoughtful decisions in their everyday lives. For example, when someone has to make a big life decision they critically assess the outcomes, consequences, and alternative options.\nAuthor Nicholas Taleb has equated the book's importance to that of Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams.\nA paper published by Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence discusses a new system: System 3, which represents \"socially conditioned behavior influenced by societal norms and self-awareness.\"\n\n\n== Replication crisis ==\nPart of the book has been swept up in the replication crisis facing psychology and the social sciences. It was discovered many prominent research findings were difficult or impossible for others to replicate, and thus the original findings were called into question. An analysis of the studies cited in chapter 4, \"The Associative Machine\", found that their replicability index (R-index) is 14, indicating essentially low to no reliability. Kahneman himself responded to the study in blog comments and acknowledged the chapter's shortcomings: \"I placed too much faith in underpowered studies.\" Others have noted the irony in the fact that Kahneman made a mistake in judgment similar to the ones he studied.\nA later analysis made a bolder claim that, despite Kahneman's previous contributions to the field of decision making, most of the book's ideas are based on 'scientific literature with shaky foundations'. A general lack of replication in the empirical studies cited in the book was given as a justification.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBehavioral economics\nCognitive reflection test\nDecision theory\nDual process theory\nList of cognitive biases\nOutline of thought\nPeak–end rule\nJoseph E.

It explores the science behind habit creation and reformation. The book reached the best seller list for The New York Times, Amazon.com, and USA Today. It was long listed for the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award in 2012.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n=== Habit loop ===\nThe Habit loop is a neurological pattern that governs any habit. It consists of three elements: a cue, a routine, and a reward. Understanding these components can help in understanding how to change bad habits or form good ones. The habit loop is always started with a cue, a trigger that transfers the brain into a mode that automatically determines which habit to use. The heart of the habit is a mental, emotional, or physical routine. Finally there is a reward, which helps the brain determine if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. In an article in The New York Times, Duhigg notes, \"The cue and reward become neurologically intertwined until a sense of craving emerges\".\nAccording to Duhigg, craving drives all habits and is essential in starting a new habit, or reshaping an old one. Duhigg describes how Procter and Gamble used research on the habit loop and its connection to cravings to develop the market for Febreze, a product that eliminates bad odors, to make a fortune.\n\n\n=== Golden rule of habit change ===\nThe Golden rule of habit change helps stop addictive habits and replace them with new ones. It states that if you keep the initial cue, replace the routine, and keep the reward, change will eventually occur, although individuals who do not believe in what they are doing will likely fall short of the expectations and give up. Belief is a critical element of such a change, though it can be structured in a number of ways including group settings. Often people who join groups like accountability groups are better off than those who act alone as individuals. Charles Duhigg used several examples to illustrate his argument, including the case of Bill Wilson, a recovering alcoholic whose newfound faith in Christ led him to create Alcoholics Anonymous. In the book, he also discussed \"willpower\" and its role in creating a habit.\n\n\n=== Keystone habits ===\nA keystone habit is an individual pattern that is unintentionally capable of triggering other habits in the lives of people. Duhigg wrote about the company Alcoa, and how CEO Paul H. O'Neill was able to raise the company's market capitalization by $27 billion by targeting safety in the work environment. O'Neil said, \"I knew I had to transform Alcoa, ... [b]ut you can't order people to change, that's not how the brain works. So I decided I was going to start by focusing on one thing. If I could start disrupting the habits around one thing, it would spread throughout the entire company.\"\n\n\n=== Training ===\nIn February, 2020, Charles Duhigg partnered with VitalSmarts, a corporate training company, to release The Power of Habit Training. The one-day course teaches people the science of habit formation introduced in the book. Learners are taught skills for recognizing the behaviors they should change and how to make new behaviors stick by manipulating the habit loop to work in their favor. The course is offered in live, virtual, and on-demand formats and is taught in public workshops both online and around the world.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

    "full_narrative": "Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 nonfiction book written by American author and speaker Susan Cain.

Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter graduating from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Cain became a lawyer and negotiations consultant. She likened her tenure as a Wall Street lawyer to \"time spent in a foreign country\". Saying her interest in writing about introversion stemmed from her extreme difficulty with public speaking, Cain switched careers and began writing at home.\nSeven years in the making, Cain's book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking was published January 24, 2012. Asked what inspired her to write the book, Cain likened introverts today to women at the dawn of the feminist movement—second-class citizens with gigantic amounts of untapped talent. She said that our institutions are designed for extroverts, causing many introverts to believe that something is wrong with them and that they should try to 'pass' as extroverts.  She concluded that this bias against introversion leads to \"a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness\", saying that it is \"the next great diversity issue of our time\".\n\n\n== Content and concepts ==\nCain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, employing academic research, supplemented with anecdotes, to describe how American culture got to this point.\n\n\n=== The \"Extrovert Ideal\" ===\nCain says Western, and in particular, American, culture is dominated by what she calls the \"Extrovert Ideal\", described as \"the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha and comfortable in the spotlight\". Western societies, being based on the Greco-Roman ideal which praises oratory, favor the man of action over the man of contemplation, and view introversion as being between a disappointment and pathology.  In contrast, traditional, pre-Americanized Asian culture is more inclined to value reticence and caution.  The Harvard Independent's Faith Zhang remarked that Quiet seems in part a gentle rebuke to a culture that values style over substance.\n\n\n=== Historical roots ===\nCain traces the historical roots of the Extrovert Ideal to the rise of industrial America in the late 19th century, before which a culture of character dominated, and after which \"a perfect storm of big business, urbanization and mass immigration\" changed America into what historian Warren Susman called a culture of personality, in which perception trumps truth. The Globe and Mail's Zosia Bielski described this transformation as being aligned with \"the rise of the salesman\" and \"the move from morals to magnetism\"—which Cain says has changed forever \"who we are and whom we admire, how we act at job interviews and what we look for in an employee, how we court our mates and raise our children\".\n\n\n=== Pitfalls of the Extrovert Ideal ===\nIn general terms, Cain has stated that we cannot be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring each other, and groups follow the most charismatic person, even though there is no correlation between being a good speaker and having great ideas. Cain says collective thinking approaches not only favor dominant extroverts, but that relying on brainstorming is a mistake, arguing that serious original thought and the expertise that generates it are almost always individual. Cain cites physiological research showing that when people (not just introverts) oppose group consensus, their brains' amygdalae \"light up\"—signaling fear of rejection—thus discouraging potentially valuable individual contributions to the group. Cain cites research indicating that people are more creative when they enjoy privacy and freedom from interruption, the implication being that enforced teamwork can stifle creativity. As a concrete example of the risks of groupthink, Cain mentions juries, in which the desire for social cohesion can sometimes short-circuit justice. She suggests that the predominantly extroverted temperament of management in the investment and banking industries—which temperament involves dopamine-related reward seeking tendencies—may have contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\n=== Defining introversion ===\nVarious schools of psychology define introversion differently. Cain's definition is that introverts have a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating environment. Introverts tend to enjoy quiet concentration, listen more than they talk, and think before they speak, and have a more circumspect and cautious approach to risk. Introverts think more, are less reckless and focus on what really matters—relationships and meaningful work. Conversely, extroverts are energized by social situations and tend to be assertive multi-taskers who think out loud and on their feet.  Cain notes that between one-third and one-half of Americans may be classified as introverts, though individuals fall at different places along an introvert-extrovert spectrum. People falling near the middle of the spectrum are called \"ambiverts\".\n\n\n=== Distinguishing introversion ===\nCain distinguishes introversion from superficially similar personality traits, in particular charging the perceived identity between shyness and introversion to be a huge misconception. She explains that shyness is inherently uncomfortable but introversion is not. Crediting retired developmental psychologist Jerome Kagan, Quiet recognizes that there is not a single cause for a given behavior; there are many routes to behaviors such as being slow to warm up, shyness, and impulsivity. Cain distinguishes introversion—characterized by her as a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating environment—from being shy (a fear of negative judgment), from being anti-social (introverts and extroverts being differently social), and from autism (inability to read social cues and understand other minds not being characteristic of introverts.)\n\n\n=== Core to our identities ===\nCain asserts that whether one is outwardly oriented to the surrounding world, or inwardly oriented to the inner riches of the mind, has as profound an effect as one's gender. Cain asserted that our lives are shaped as profoundly by personality as by gender or race, that the single most important aspect of personality is where we fall on the introvert-extrovert spectrum, and that one's place on this continuum \"influences our choice of friends and mates, how we make conversation, resolve differences, and show love. It affects the careers we choose and whether or not we succeed at them.\"\n\n\n=== Introverts acting as \"pseudo-extroverts\" ===\nAccording to Cain, in a culture that is biased against them, introverts are pressured to act like extroverts instead of embracing their serious, often quiet and reflective style.  Cain's research included visits to what she termed three nerve centers of the Extrovert Ideal—a Tony Robbins self-help seminar, the Harvard Business School, and a megachurch—noting the discomfort and struggles experienced by introverts in those environments and \"shining a light\" on the bias against introversion.  She said that people have to act out of our true character sometimes but that it is not healthy to act out of one's true character most or all of the time: \"Whenever you try to pass as something you're not, you lose a part of yourself along the way. You especially lose a sense of how to spend your time.\"\nHowever, Cain essentially adopts the \"Free Trait Theory\" of Dr. Brian Little, agreeing that introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for (core personal goals)—work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly—provided they also grant themselves restorative niches, which are places to go and time to be their real selves. Also, in a February 2012 article, Cain listed six self-help strategies introverts may use to nourish their strengths, including \"talking deeply\", working alone, reading others' works (\"a deeply social act\"), listening well, taking mini-breaks from overstimulating environments, and practicing \"quiet commitment\".\n\n\n=== Physiology of temperament ===\nCain maintains that there are introverts and extroverts in almost every species of the animal kingdom, each having a corresponding survival strategy. She says that research indicates our own degree of introversion or extroversion is detectable in infants and likely to be innate, and about 50% heritable (half by nature, half by nurture). Babies who are more highly reactive (more sensitive) to stimulation are more likely to develop into introverts, while less reactive (less sensitive) babies generally become extroverts who actually draw on the energy around them. Introverts appear to be less responsive than extroverts to dopamine (a brain chemical linked to reward-driven learning), and have a more circumspect and cautious approach to risk than do extroverts. Introverts are more governed by the neocortex, the part of the brain responsible for thinking, planning, language and decision making.\n\n\n=== In the workplace ===\nConcerning the workplace, Quiet critiques today's perceived overemphasis on collaboration: brainstorming leading to groupthink, and meetings leading to organizational inertia. Cain urges changes to the workplace to make it less focused on what she terms \"The New Groupthink\"—the idea that creativity and productivity emerge from a necessarily gregarious place—and more conducive to deep thought and solo reflection.  According to Cain, research shows that charismatic leaders earn bigger paychecks but do not have better corporate performance; that brainstorming results in lower quality ideas and the more vocally assertive extroverts are the most likely to be heard; that the amount of space allotted to each employee has shrunk 60% since the 1970s; and that open office plans are associated with reduced concentration and productivity, impaired memory, higher turnover and increased illness. Cain says that the more creative people tend to be \"socially poised introverts\", solitude is a crucial and underrated ingredient for creativity, and office designs and work plans should allow people to be alone as well as to socialize.\n\n\n=== Personal relationships ===\nCain has noted that people of different temperament who become involved in personal relationships can encounter misunderstanding and conflict.  After a day's work an introvert may need to quietly recharge, while the extrovert may find the introvert's withdrawal hurtful; conversely, the extrovert may want to jointly socialize with others, which the introvert may find exhausting. Cain advises, first, a mutual understanding of where the other party is coming from; and second, balancing their respective needs for socializing and for solitude in a practical compromise in how the couple connects and how the couple jointly socializes with others.\n\n\n=== Education and child development ===\nCain describes how introversion in children is not a defect but instead may involve a careful, sensitive temperament that may bring stronger academics, enhanced creativity and a unique brand of leadership and empathy.  Cain says that introverts win a disproportionate number of Phi Beta Kappa keys and National Merit Scholarship finalist positions, cheat and break rules less, are more likely to be described by parents and caregivers as empathetic or conscientious, and are less likely to get into car accidents, participate in extreme sports and place large financial bets. Cain advises that students need more privacy and autonomy, and should be taught to work together but also how to work alone. Judith Warner, an author of parenting books, approved of Cain's advice that parents should view introverted children's social style with understanding rather than fear.\n\n\n=== Balance ===\nCain is not seeking introvert domination but a better balance and inclusion of different work styles, acknowledging that big ideas and great leadership can come from either personality type. Cain cites studies showing that introverts are better at leading proactive employees because they listen to and let them run with their ideas, while extroverts are better at leading passive employees because they have a knack for motivation and inspiration. Cain has emphasized that the key to maximizing talents is to put yourself into the zone of stimulation that is right for you. The Harvard Independent's Faith Zhang closed her review of Quiet with the observation that Cain's point is not that introverts are inherently superior or that we should all shroud ourselves in solitude, but that diversity provides balance and makes for a fuller, richer world.\n\n\n=== The future ===\nCain asserts that introverts today are where women were in the 1950s and early 1960s—a population discounted for something that went to the core of who they were, but a population on the verge of coming into its own. She adds that we're at the cusp of a real sea change in the way we understand this personality type, Cain's own website urging readers to \"join the Quiet Revolution\". Beyond urging consciousness-raising about the harmfulness of culture's bias against introversion, Cain urged companies to rethink hiring and promotion policies and office design, and encouraged educators to avoid constant group work and be trained in recognizing varieties of temperament to support quieter children to be functional and achieving for what they are rather than trying to \"turn them into extroverts\". Cain further urged research into determining which situations are best suited to introverts and extroverts and how they can most effectively partner with each other.\n\n\n== Related lectures and publications ==\n\nCain presented talks at the TED2012 Conference and TED 2014 (All-Stars). In 2015, Cain formally co-founded Quiet Revolution, a mission-based company based on the principles in Quiet, and in 2016 published her second book, Quiet Power: The Secret Strengths of Introverts, directed to children and teens and their educators and parents.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nWithin one week of its publication, Forbes' Jenna Goudreau noted that the book was featured by several major media outlets and was shared extensively across the Web. Goudreau observed that \"readers said they felt validated and seen for the first time\". Within three weeks of publication, InformationWeek's Debra Donston-Miller noted that introversion and extroversion were being widely discussed due in large part to Quiet, Cain's work being the focus of Time magazine's February 6, 2012 cover article. In 2015, Laura Holson wrote in The New York Times that Cain had \"started, or at least was on the forefront of, a bona fide publishing trend\" concerning introverts, and in 2017 Harvard Magazine's Lydialyle Gibson noted that in the aftermath of Quiet, \"introversion came suddenly into vogue\". Similarly, a 2019 Scientific American article related how \"introverts have been having their moment\" since Quiet's 2012 publication.\nBy 2016, Quiet had been translated into over forty languages.\nElaine Aron, Ph.D., author of The Highly Sensitive Person (1996), responded to Quiet and its related Time cover story by stating that Cain was in fact describing highly sensitive persons (HSPs, defined in terms of sensory processing sensitivity) and not introverts (which Aron says is recently becoming defined more narrowly in terms of social interaction).  Though Aron wrote that Cain and others blurred the lines between sensitivity and introversion, Aron called the Time article \"a huge, huge step\" for understanding HSPs, and that as more is learned, the 30% of HSPs who are social extroverts will be better understood.\nChanges caused by Quiet include Steelcase collaborating with Cain (2014) to design office spaces to include quiet areas where workers can have privacy for a time, in contrast to open plan offices, and Herman Miller matching  work models (e.g., impromptu chats, team status-report huddles, and concentrated individual work) with physical settings (e.g., bench desk, small meeting room, open forum). The ABA Journal's Leslie A. Gordon wrote in early 2016 that, \"thanks largely to interest generated by Cain's book\", law schools and law firms were using introversion preferences to influence hiring, placement, and training of attorneys.\nPsychologist Christopher Peterson wrote that even professional positive psychologists may be implicitly perpetuating \"The Extrovert Ideal\", for example, by privileging activated feelings like happiness while undervaluing quiet feelings like contentment. Writing that both views of psychological wellness—both the noisy and extroverted view, and a quiet and introverted view—deserve scientific attention, Peterson closed by calling for a \"quiet positive psychology\".\nGigaOM's Jessica Stillman extended the concepts of Quiet to analyze coworking (working independently but in the same environment as others), remote working, and other \"workshifting\" (non-traditional worksite) arrangements, noting that such arrangements pose both benefits and dangers for introverts.  While coworkers can \"set their own level of contact\", she noted that \"the ability to work from anywhere might enable more withdrawal than is healthy among introverts\".  She also echoed the cautionary argument that \"too often ... we choose our work environment on autopilot.\"\nAs the November 2012 U.S. presidential election approached, Quiet's concepts were applied to contrast former President Clinton with 2012 candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Cain having noted that both Obama and Romney were introverts. Concerning leadership in general, Cain adopted Peter Drucker's statement that effective leaders \"had little or no 'charisma' and little use either for the term or what it signifies.\"\nCornell Law School's Sherry Colb extended to the jury system Quiet's assertion that a successful \"wisdom-of-crowds phenomenon\" typically emerges when individuals in a group share their respective contributions after being separately and independently conceived. Colb proposed a jury system in which, after all evidence has been presented, respective jurors would compose written analyses of the facts and issues, and express a verdict; the jurors' various documents would be distributed and read by all other jurors before in-person deliberation would begin.\nIn the wake of the December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School (Newtown) shooting, Quiet's author was cited for the concern that introverted people, or people who are quiet for other reasons, receive unfair suspicion or stigmatization because of violent acts committed by a few solitary individuals. Quiet's critiques of groupwork and brainstorming were cited in the writings of such sources as Harvard Business School's Professor Emeritus James Heskett and Fast Company's Co.Design senior editor Belinda Lanks. After Yahoo!'s February 2013 announcement of discontinuation of a remote work option for employees, Quiet was cited by NBC News' Isolde Raftery for its concern that creativity would be hindered, and by The Miami Herald's Leonard Pitts Jr. against the belief that synergy always produces the best results, and against the one-size-fits-all mentality that says productivity and creativity are found only when colleagues meet at the water cooler.\nQuiet was chosen as the common reading choice for Case Western Reserve University's 2013–2014 \"First Year Experience\" program which helps new students transition to university life and develop connections, the chair of the university's common reading committee explaining that the book will encourage students to reflect on what kinds of learners and professionals they will be, and how they fit in socially and relate to others.\nThree years after Quiet's publication, David DiSalvo wrote in Forbes that a \"groundswell support for the book's thesis\" resulted in \"a sort of cultish affinity for introversion\", but cautioned that \"as with all movement-making arguments\", they have \"fueled ... shallow conclusions\" that were not made in the book itself. DiSalvo cited studies indicating that introverts' elevated sensitivity to personality traits can manifest as bias against extroverts in performance appraisals and reward giving.\nTen years after Quiet's publication, a Washington Post reviewer wrote that Quiet had become \"a resounding success with readers, book clubs, universities and professional conferences, and transformed Cain into an unlikely but essential thought leader in a new era of self-help writing.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Wall Street Journal's Philip Delves Broughton reviewed Quiet as \"an earnest and enlightening 300-page inquiry into introversion and its uses\", described examples of the research and investigations Cain undertook, and concluded that \"Ms. Cain's rich, intelligent book will probably have broad appeal.\"\nThe Harvard Independent's Faith Zhang remarked that \"though it draws on studies across a variety of fields, including psychology, sociology, and neurology, Quiet is not even a pop science book; it is part affirmation, part social commentary, part self-help primer, supported by but not primarily focused on science\". Zhang found flaw in generalizations in Quiet's \"Soft Power\" chapter on East Asian culture, but found the book's most interesting chapter to be the one tracing the social history describing the shift from the \"culture of character\" to the \"culture of personality\". Zhang concluded that \"Quiet has much to offer both introverts and the extroverts who would like to understand them\".  Jenny Lee subsequently wrote in the Asian American magazine Hyphen that Zhang's brief critique of Quiet's \"Soft Power\" chapter was the exception among reviews; Lee further asserted that despite its disclaimer about not encouraging ethno-cultural stereotypes, Cain's chapter overgeneralized about Asian and Asian American personality styles and reinforced the \"model minority myth\".\nIn Scientific American, Gareth Cook described Quiet as \"part book, part manifesto\".\nThe Chicago Tribune said that \"Quiet is not a scientific tract. But Cain ... draws from a wide array of academic research, enlivened with colorful anecdotes, to describe how American culture got to this point.\"\nWriting in The New York Times, Judith Warner gave Quiet a mixed review, to which Cain blogged a response the same day. Concerning Quiet's writing form, Warner commented that Quiet is \"a long and ploddingly earnest book\", and contains \"go-go language\" and \"gratuitous sloganeering ... (that) offsets Cain's serious research rather badly\". Warner also stated that Cain \"combines on-the-scenes reporting with a wide range of social science research and a fair bit of 'quiet power' cheerleading\". Cain replied to Warner's critique of the book's content: Warner asserted that Quiet's definition of introversion expanded to include \"all that is wise and good, (so) that (the definition) is largely meaningless except as yet another vehicle for promoting self-esteem\"; Cain replied that \"Warner badly misunderstands\" that the traits listed in Quiet's \"Author's Note\" were not descriptive of introversion \"but that culturally these traits have always been bound together under the 'contemplation' rubric, and need to be addressed as such.\" Warner hypothesized that, had Cain focused in \"other sorts of places\" than \"Harvard Business School, corporate boardrooms, executive suites\", that Cain \"would undoubtedly have discovered a world of introverts quite contented with who they are\"; Cain replied that her research and feedback confirm introverts' \"difficult experiences\" even in fields that \"Warner imagines are safe havens for introverts\", and added that Warner's response to Quiet \"has an interesting precedent in the early years of feminism... (in which) a distinct minority felt proud and content as they were, and couldn't see what all the fuss was about\".\nPhilosopher and author Damon Young, writing in The Age, wrote that \"Cain is patient, meticulous and empathetic on the psychology. She outlines the problems clearly and gives workable solutions. She is less nimble with questions of history and society. For example, her use of a handful of quotes and aphorisms to demonstrate Eastern and Western outlooks on speech is clumsy. Her prose is plain but warm and she distils research well, with the use of anecdotes and literary examples.\"\nRavi Chandra wrote in Psychology Today that Quiet was \"a worthwhile read, but problematic in particulars.\" Chandra also wrote, \"...one chapter especially stuck in my craw. Soft Power: Asian-Americans and the Extrovert Ideal falls short of the understanding, validation, and broad-minded sensitivity which Cain champions.\"\n\n\n=== Distinctions and recognition ===\nBestseller list placement (hardcover nonfiction category unless otherwise noted): Quiet reached:\n\nNo. 1 on the NPR Bestseller List,\nNo. 3 on the Los Angeles Times Best Seller list,\nNo. 3 on The Washington Post Book World bestsellers list,\nNo. 4 on The New York Times Best Seller list being on the list (top 15) for sixteen weeks,\nNo. 12 best selling book (across all categories) on Amazon.com (March 3, 2012, not necessarily a peak ranking),\nNo. 2 on The New York Times Best Seller list (paperback nonfiction), by March 2019 having been on the list for 166 weeks,\nNo. 1 bestselling original nonfiction book of 2012 as listed by the Toronto Star, and\nNo. 7 on The Wall Street Journal bestselling e-book list (December 2017)\nQuiet was voted No. 1 nonfiction book of 2012 in the \"Goodreads Choice Awards\".\nJohn Dupuis collated information from 69 \"Best of 2012\" book lists, and wrote for the National Geographic Society's ScienceBlogs that Quiet was the most listed science related book.\n\"Best of 2012 List\" inclusions, not limited to science book lists:\n\nGuardian First Book Award 2012 Longlist (one of four nonfiction books)\nFast Company (twelve best business books)\nThe Guardian/The Observer (ten best psychology books)\nKirkus Reviews (100 best nonfiction)\nThe Christian Science Monitor (No. 7 best nonfiction)\nO, The Oprah Magazine (nineteen best books)\nNew Zealand Listener (100 best books)\nInc.

    "full_narrative": "Carol Susan Dweck (born October 17, 1946) is an American psychologist. She holds the Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professorship of Psychology at Stanford University. Dweck is known for her work on motivation and mindset. She was on the faculty at the University of Illinois, Harvard, and Columbia before joining the Stanford University faculty in 2004. She was named an Association for Psychological Science (APS) James McKeen Cattell Fellow in 2013, an APS Mentor Awardee in 2019, and an APS William James Fellow in 2020, and has been a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 2012.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDweck was born in New York. Her father worked in the export-import business and her mother in advertising. She was the only daughter and the middle sibling of three children.\nIn her sixth grade class at the P.S. 153 elementary school in Brooklyn, New York, students were seated in order of their IQ; some responsibilities like erasing the blackboard and carrying the flag were reserved to students with the highest IQs. She later described becoming \"increasingly afraid to risk her reputation as one of the most intelligent children in the class\", by avoiding participation in a spelling bee and a French competition.\nShe graduated from Barnard College in 1967, and earned a Ph.D. in psychology from Yale University in 1972.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nAfter obtaining her PhD, Dweck joined the faculty of the University of Illinois, eventually reaching the rank of associate professor. In 1981, she became a professor at Harvard's Laboratory of Human Development, then returned to the University of Illinois in 1985. In 1989, she joined the faculty of Columbia University, and in 2004 became a Lewis and Virginia Eaton professor of psychology at Stanford University.\nDweck's research focuses on mindset and motivation.\n\n\n=== Mindset work ===\n\nDweck's key contribution to social psychology relates to the concept of implicit theories of intelligence and personality, which she first introduced in a 1988 paper. In the academic literature, the term \"implicit theories\" is often treated as synonymous with \"implicit beliefs\", \"self-theories\", or \"mindsets\", and is defined by Dweck as \"core assumptions about the malleability of personal attributes\". Dweck later popularized the concept in her 2006 non-academic book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.\nAccording to Dweck, individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of where ability comes from; those believing their success to be based on innate ability are said to have a \"fixed\" theory of intelligence (fixed mindset), and those believing their success is based on hard work, learning, training and doggedness are said to have a \"growth\" or an \"incremental\" theory of intelligence (growth mindset). In 2012, Dweck defined fixed and growth mindsets, in interview, in this way:\n\nIn a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that's that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.\nAccording to Dweck, individuals may not necessarily be aware of their own mindset, but their mindset can still be discerned based on their behavior, being especially evident in their reaction to failure. Dweck has described fixed-mindset individuals as dreading failure because it is a negative statement on their basic abilities, while growth mindset individuals don't mind or fear failure as much because they realize their performance can be improved and learning comes from failure. According to Dweck, these two mindsets play an important role in all aspects of a person's life; she argues that the growth mindset allows a person to live a less stressful and more successful life.\nAs explained by Dweck, a growth mindset is not just about effort. Dweck has written that a common misunderstanding is that the growth mindset is \"just about effort\". She states, \"The growth mindset was intended to help close achievement gaps, not hide them. It is about telling the truth about a student's current achievement and then, together, doing something about it, helping him or her become smarter.\"\nDweck warns of the dangers of praising intelligence as it puts children in a fixed mindset, and they will not want to be challenged because they will not want to look stupid or make a mistake. She notes, \"Praising children's intelligence harms motivation and it harms performance.\" She advises, \"If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, and keep on learning. That way, their children don't have to be slaves of praise. They will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence.\"\n\n\n=== Recent work ===\nIn 2017, she stated \"I am now developing a broad theory that puts motivation and the formation of mindsets (or beliefs) at the heart of social and personality development.\" Later that year she published the theory in a paper titled \"From Needs to Goals and Representations: Foundations for a Unified Theory of Motivation, Personality, and Development\".\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\n\nDweck's findings have been reported in journals such as Psychological Science and Nature, with research teams led by Dweck.\nSome critics have said that Dweck's research can be difficult to replicate; for instance, a 2017 opinion piece by Toby Young, associate editor of The Spectator, states that:\n\nTimothy Bates, a psychology professor at Edinburgh University, has been trying for several years to replicate Dweck’s findings, each time without success, and his colleagues haven’t been able to either. Dweck explains these failures by claiming the psychologists in question don’t create the right experimental environment — it’s too delicate a task for these ham-fisted troglodytes. But if professors of psychology can’t repeat the results, what hope do teachers surrounded by unruly children have?\nNick Brown, who co-developed the GRIM statistical test, argued in 2017: \"If your effect is so fragile that it can only be reproduced [under strictly controlled conditions], then why do you think it can be reproduced by schoolteachers?\" Brown points out that most of the research in this area has been conducted by Dweck or her collaborators. After Brown's application of the GRIM method showed that some of the means reported in the 1998 study were \"impossible\", he reviewed the original study data and found some errors in the recording of data, which Dweck publicly acknowledged. Brown praised Dweck's \"openness and willingness to address the problems\".\nOther education and psychology researchers have expressed worry that \"mindset\" has simply become another aspect to be assessed and graded in children; Matt O'Leary, an education lecturer at Birmingham City University, tweeted that it was \"farcical\" that his six-year-old daughter was being graded on her attitude towards learning. David James, professor of social sciences at Cardiff University and editor of the British Journal of Sociology of Education, says \"it's great to dwell on the fact that intelligence is not fundamentally genetic and unchangeable\", but he believes the limitations of mindset outweigh its uses: \"It individualises the failure – 'they couldn't change the way they think, so that's why they failed'.\" James notes that a study in 2013 showed no statistically significant effect of mindset theory.\nIn July 2019, a large randomized controlled trial of growth mindset training by the Education Endowment Foundation in England, involved 101 schools and 5018 pupils across the country. After the trial they found that pupils in schools receiving the intervention showed no additional progress in literacy or numeracy relative to pupils in the control group. These findings were determined by the national Key Stage 2 tests in reading, grammar, punctuation, and spelling (GPS), and mathematics.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nDweck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002, and received the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association (APA) in 2011.

    "full_narrative": "The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference is the debut book by Canadian writer Malcolm Gladwell, first published by Little, Brown in 2000. Gladwell defines a tipping point as \"the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point.\" The book seeks to explain and describe the \"mysterious\" sociological changes that mark everyday life. As Gladwell states: \"Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses do.\" The examples of such changes in his book include the rise in popularity and sales of Hush Puppies shoes (Leather Suede Shoes) in the mid-1990s and the steep drop in New York City's crime rate after 1990.\n\n\n== The three rules ==\nGladwell describes the \"three rules of epidemics\" (or the three \"agents of change\") in the tipping points of epidemics.\n\n\n=== The Law of the Few ===\n\"The Law of the Few\" is, as Gladwell states: \"The success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts.\" According to Gladwell, economists call this the \"80/20 Principle, which is the idea that in any situation roughly 80 percent of the 'work' will be done by 20 percent of the participants\" (see Pareto Principle). These people are described in the following ways:\n\nConnectors are the people in a community who know large numbers of people and who are in the habit of making introductions. A connector is essentially the social equivalent of a computer network hub. They usually know people across an array of social, cultural, professional, and economic circles, and make a habit of introducing people who work or live in different circles. They are people who \"link us up with the world...people with a special gift for bringing the world together.\" They are \"a handful of people with a truly extraordinary knack [... for] making friends and acquaintances.\" Gladwell characterizes these individuals as having social networks of over one hundred people. To illustrate, he cites the following examples: the midnight ride of Paul Revere, Milgram's experiments in the small world problem, the \"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\" trivia game, Dallas businessman Roger Horchow, and Chicagoan Lois Weisberg, a person who understands the concept of the weak tie. Gladwell attributes the social success of Connectors to the fact that \"their ability to span many different worlds is a function of something intrinsic to their personality, some combination of curiosity, self-confidence, sociability, and energy.\"\n \n\nMavens are \"information specialists\", or \"people we rely upon to connect us with new information.\" They accumulate knowledge, especially about the marketplace, and know how to share it with others. Gladwell cites Mark Alpert as a prototypical Maven who is \"almost pathologically helpful\", further adding, \"he can't help himself.\" In this vein, Alpert himself concedes, \"A Maven is someone who wants to solve other people's problems, generally by solving his own.\" According to Gladwell, Mavens start \"word-of-mouth epidemics\" due to their knowledge, social skills, and ability to communicate. As Gladwell states: \"Mavens are really information brokers, sharing and trading what they know.\"\nSalesmen are \"persuaders\", charismatic people with powerful negotiation skills. They tend to have an indefinable trait that goes beyond what they say, which makes others want to agree with them. Gladwell's examples include California businessman Tom Gau and news anchor Peter Jennings, and he cites several studies about the persuasive implications of non-verbal cues, including a headphone nod study (conducted by Gary Wells of the University of Alberta and Richard Petty of the University of Missouri) and William S. Condon's cultural microrhythms study.\n\n\n=== The Stickiness Factor ===\nThe Stickiness Factor refers to the specific content of a message that renders its impact memorable. Popular children's television programs such as Sesame Street and Blue's Clues pioneered the properties of the stickiness factor, thus enhancing effective retention of educational content as well as entertainment value. Gladwell states, \"Kids don't watch when they are stimulated and look away when they are bored. They watch when they understand and look away when they are confused\" (Gladwell, p. 102).\n\n\n=== The Power of Context ===\nHuman behavior is sensitive to and strongly influenced by its environment. Gladwell explains: \"Epidemics are sensitive to the conditions and circumstances of the times and places in which they occur.\" For example, \"zero tolerance\" efforts to combat minor crimes such as farebeating and vandalism of the New York subway led to a decline in more violent crimes citywide. Gladwell describes the bystander effect, and explains how Dunbar's number plays into the tipping point, using Rebecca Wells' novel Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, evangelist John Wesley, and the high-tech firm W. L. Gore and Associates as examples. Dunbar's number is the maximum number of individuals in a society or group that someone can have real social relationships with, which Gladwell dubs the \"rule of 150.\"\n\n\n== Other key concepts ==\nGladwell also includes two chapters of case studies, situations in which tipping point concepts were used in specific situations. These situations include the athletic shoe company Airwalk, the diffusion model, how rumors are spread, decreasing the spread of syphilis in Baltimore, teen suicide in Micronesia, and teen smoking in the United States.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Public ===\nGladwell received an estimated US$1–1.5 million advance for The Tipping Point, which sold 1.7 million copies by 2006. In the wake of the book's success, Gladwell was able to earn as much as $40,000 per lecture. Sales increased again in 2006 after the release of Gladwell's next book, Blink. The Guardian ranked The Tipping Point #94 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century.\n\n\n=== Scientific ===\nSome of Gladwell's analysis as to why the phenomenon of the \"tipping point\" occurs (particularly in relation to his idea of the \"law of the few\") and its unpredictable elements is based on the 1967 small-world experiment by social psychologist Stanley Milgram. Milgram distributed letters to 160 students in Nebraska, with instructions that they be sent to a stockbroker in Boston (not personally known to them) by passing the letters to anyone else that they believed to be socially closer to the target. The study found that it took an average of six links to deliver each letter. Of particular interest to Gladwell was the finding that just three friends of the stockbroker provided the final link for half of the letters that arrived successfully. This gave rise to Gladwell's theory that certain types of people are key to the dissemination of information.\nIn 2003, Duncan Watts, a network theory physicist at Columbia University, repeated the Milgram study by using a web site to recruit 61,000 people to send messages to 18 targets worldwide. He successfully reproduced Milgram's results (the average length of the chain was approximately six links). However, when he examined the pathways taken, he found that \"hubs\" (highly connected people) were not crucial. Only 5% of the e-mail messages had passed through one of the hubs. This casts doubt on Gladwell's assertion that specific types of people are responsible for bringing about large levels of change.\nWatts pointed out that if it were as simple as finding the individuals that can disseminate information prior to a marketing campaign, advertising agencies would presumably have a far higher success rate than they do. He also stated that Gladwell's theory does not square with much of his research into human social dynamics performed in the last ten years.\nEconomist Steven Levitt and Gladwell have a running dispute about whether the fall in New York City's crime rate can be attributed to the actions of the police department and \"Fixing Broken Windows\" (as claimed in The Tipping Point). In Freakonomics, Levitt attributes the decrease in crime to two primary factors: 1) a drastic increase in the number of police officers trained and deployed on the streets and hiring Raymond W. Kelly as police commissioner (thanks to the efforts of former mayor David Dinkins) and 2) a decrease in the number of unwanted children made possible by Roe v. Wade, causing crime to drop nationally in all major cities—\"[e]ven in Los Angeles, a city notorious for bad policing\". And although psychologist Steven Pinker argues the second factor relies on tenuous links, recent evidence seems to uphold the likelihood of a significant causal link.\n\n\n== Revenge of the Tipping Point ==\nA sequel was released in 2024, titled Revenge of the Tipping Point. This book revisits Gladwell's previous work and retouches on some key ideas.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTipping point (sociology)\nMicromotives and Macrobehavior\nDiffusion of innovations\nEpidemiology\nFold catastrophe\nHundredth monkey effect\nMeme\nMade to Stick\nMicrotrends: The Small Forces Behind Tomorrow's Big Changes\nThe Big Mo\nRevenge of the Tipping Point\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nReview in the New York Times\nThe Tipping Point on Malcolm Gladwell's webpage.",

Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nGladwell was a journalist for The Washington Post before writing for The New Yorker. The subjects for his articles, usually non-fiction, range from \"Dave Gaspayad's infomercial empire to computers that analyze pop songs\". His familiarity with academic material has allowed him to write about \"psychology experiments, sociological studies, law articles, statistical surveys of plane crashes and classical musicians and hockey players\", which he converts into prose accessible to a general audience and which sometimes pass as memes into the popular imagination.\nBefore Outliers, Gladwell wrote two best-selling books: The Tipping Point (2000) and Blink (2005). Both books have been described as \"pop economics\". The Tipping Point focuses on how ideas and behaviors reach critical mass, such as how Hush Puppies rapidly grew popular in the 1990s. Blink explains \"what happens during the first two seconds we encounter something, before we actually start to think\". All Gladwell's books focus on singularities: singular events in The Tipping Point, singular moments in Blink, and singular people in Outliers. Gladwell was drawn to writing about singular things after he discovered that \"they always made the best stories\". Convinced that the most unusual stories had the best chance of reaching the front page of a newspaper, he was \"quickly weaned off the notion that [he] should be interested in the mundane\".\nFor Outliers, Gladwell spent time looking for research that made claims that were contrary to what he considered to be popularly held beliefs. In one of the book's chapters, in which Gladwell focuses on the American public school system, he used research conducted by university sociologist Karl Alexander that suggested that \"the way in which education is discussed in the United States is backward\". In another chapter, Gladwell cites pioneering research performed by Canadian psychologist Roger Barnsley when discussing how the birthdate of a young hockey player can determine their skill level in the future.\nWhile writing the book, Gladwell noted that \"the biggest misconception about success is that we do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work.\" In Outliers, he hopes to show that there are a lot more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to \"move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person\". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the \"man\"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, \"What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think.\"\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn his introduction, Gladwell discusses the Roseto effect which enabled a small, close-knit town in Pennsylvania to have almost no history of heart disease, substance abuse, or societal ills, seemingly due to the supportive, comforting social environment of its Italian-descended population. The remainder of Outliers has two parts: \"Part One: Opportunity\" contains five chapters, and \"Part Two: Legacy\" has four. The book also contains an Introduction and Epilogue. Focusing on outliers, defined by Gladwell as people who do not fit into our normal understanding of achievement, Outliers deals with exceptional people, especially those who are smart, rich, and successful, and those who operate at the extreme outer edge of what is statistically plausible. The book offers examples that include the musical ensemble the Beatles, Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In the introduction, Gladwell lays out the purpose of Outliers: \"It's not enough to ask what successful people are like. [...] It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.\" Throughout the publication, he discusses how family, culture, and friendship each play a role in an individual's success, and he constantly asks whether successful people deserve the praise that we give them.\nThe book begins with the observation that a disproportionate number of elite Canadian hockey players are born in the earlier months of the calendar year. The reason behind this is that since youth hockey leagues determine eligibility by the calendar year, children born on January 1 play in the same league as those born on December 31 in the same year. Because children born earlier in the year are statistically larger and more physically mature than their younger competitors, and they are often identified as better athletes, this leads to extra coaching and a higher likelihood of being selected for elite hockey leagues. This phenomenon in which \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer\" is dubbed \"accumulative advantage\" by Gladwell, while sociologist Robert K. Merton calls it \"the Matthew Effect\", named after a biblical verse in the Gospel of Matthew: \"For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him, that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.\" Outliers asserts that success depends on the idiosyncrasies of the selection process used to identify talent just as much as it does on the athletes' natural abilities.\n\nA common theme that appears throughout Outliers is the \"10,000-Hour Rule\", based on a study by Anders Ericsson. Gladwell claims that greatness requires enormous time, using the source of the Beatles' musical talents and Gates' computer savvy as examples. The Beatles performed live in Hamburg, Germany over 1,200 times from 1960 to 1964, amassing more than 10,000 hours of playing time, therefore meeting the 10,000-Hour Rule. Gladwell asserts that all of the time the Beatles spent performing shaped their talent, and quotes a Beatles' biographer, Philip Norman, as claiming \"So by the time they returned to England from Hamburg, Germany, 'they sounded like no one else. It was the making of them.'\" Gates met the 10,000-Hour Rule when he gained access to a high school computer in 1968 at the age of 13, and spent 10,000 hours programming on it.\nIn Outliers, Gladwell interviews Gates, who says that unique access to a computer as early as 1968 when they were not commonplace helped him succeed. Without that access, Gladwell states that Gates would still be \"a highly intelligent, driven, charming person and a successful professional\", but that he might not be worth US$50 billion.  Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 years. He also notes that he himself took exactly 10 years to meet the 10,000-Hour Rule, during his brief tenure at The American Spectator and his more recent job at The Washington Post.\n\nReemphasizing his theme, Gladwell continuously reminds the reader that genius is not the only or even the most important thing when determining a person's success. Using an anecdote to illustrate his claim, he discusses the story of Christopher Langan, a man who ended up owning a horse farm in rural Missouri despite having an IQ of 195 (Gladwell claims that Einstein's was 150). Gladwell points out that Langan has not reached a high level of success because of the destitute, dysfunctional environment in which he grew up. With no one in Langan's life and nothing in his background to help him take advantage of his exceptional gifts, he had to find success by himself. \"No one—not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses—ever makes it alone\", writes Gladwell.\nGladwell notes how many of the richest men in history were fortunate to come of age during decades of technological boom, or be born at times of low birth rates when universities and job opportunities were more open to applicants.  Later, Gladwell compares Langan with Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Noting that they typify innate natural abilities that should have helped them both succeed in life, Gladwell argues that Oppenheimer's upbringing made a pivotal difference in his life. Oppenheimer grew up in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan, was the son of a successful businessman and a painter, attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School on Central Park West, and was afforded a childhood of concerted cultivation. Outliers argues that these opportunities gave Oppenheimer the chance to develop the practical intelligence necessary for success. Gladwell then provides an anecdote: When Oppenheimer was a student at the University of Cambridge he attempted to poison one of his tutors. He avoided punishment, and continued his studies by using the skills gained from his cultivated upbringing in his negotiation with the university's administrators, who had wanted to expel him.\nIn the next chapter, Gladwell explains the fact that Asians are good at mathematics by correlating it to rice agriculture, particularly the fact that rice cultivation requires more work ethic, discipline, and longer hours than Western wheat agriculture, and East Asian school systems have shorter summer recesses than Americans. The pattern of words for counting numbers is more logical in Asian languages than western languages. \nGladwell discusses how airline crashes can result from miscommunication between pilots and the control tower.  The deferential culture of some ethnic groups can make those pilots reluctant to convey imminent danger to ground controllers.  In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell advances the notion that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success stems from the fact that they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socioeconomic group. Gladwell discusses how Appalachian and Scottish culture both have a history of violent feuds. This is caused by the need for constant vigilance to guard livestock from rustlers – something not required of lowland farmers who grow mostly crops instead of livestock.       \nBefore the book concludes, Gladwell writes about the unique roots of his Jamaican mother, Joyce, a descendant of African slaves. Joyce attended University College in London, where she met and fell in love with Graham Gladwell, a young mathematician. After moving together to Canada, Graham became a math professor and Joyce a writer and therapist. While Gladwell acknowledges his mother's ambition and intelligence, he also points out opportunities offered to his parents that helped them live a life better than those of other slave descendants in the West Indies. Gladwell also explains that, in the 18th century, a white plantation owner in Jamaica bought a female slave and made her his mistress. This act inadvertently saved the slave and her offspring from a life of brutal servitude. As one of the slave's descendants, this turn of luck led to Gladwell's relatively successful position in life. Summarizing the publication, Gladwell notes that success \"is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky\", and at the end of the book, he remarks, \"Outliers wasn't intended as autobiography. But you could read it as an extended apology for my success.\"\n\n\n== Style ==\nOutliers has been described as a form of autobiography, as Gladwell mixes in elements from his own life into the book to give it a more personal touch. Lev Grossman, writing in Time magazine, called Outliers a \"more personal book than its predecessors\", noting, \"If you hold it up to the light, at the right angle, you can read it as a coded autobiography: a successful man trying to figure out his own context, how success happened to him and what it means.\" He also surmised that Gladwell feels guilty about his success and believes that Christopher Langan should have experienced the same success that he had.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPublished by Little, Brown and Company on November 18, 2008, Outliers debuted at number one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times in the United States and The Globe and Mail in Canada on November 28, 2008, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Between June 2011, when the paperback version was released, and February 2017, the book made the New York Times bestseller list for paperback nonfiction 232 times.\nDavid A. Shaywitz, reviewing the book in The Wall Street Journal, praised Gladwell's writing style as \"iconic\", and asserted that \"many new nonfiction authors seek to define themselves as the 'Malcolm Gladwell of' their chosen topic.\" He complimented its clarity and easy grace, but also pointed to these as possible Achilles' heels for Gladwell because of his oversimplification of complex sociological phenomena to \"compact, pithy explanations\". Furthermore, he praised the book for asking some important questions, such as \"How much potential out there is being ignored? How much raw talent remains uncultivated and ultimately lost because we cling to outmoded ideas of what success looks like and what is required to achieve it?\"\nIn a discussion about the book in  Slate magazine, John Horgan was particularly moved by Gladwell's family history. He felt that the links between race and achievement were given substantive analysis, but found the lessons mentioned in Outliers to be \"oddly anticlimactic, even dispiriting\". His contribution concluded by remarking, \"Outliers represents a squandered opportunity for Gladwell—himself an outlier, an enormously talented and influential writer and the descendant of an African slave—to make a major contribution to our ongoing discourse about nature, nurture, and race.\" BusinessWeek gave the book four out of five stars and appreciated its \"Aha!\" moments, but wondered if Gladwell purposely omits evidence that contradicts his thesis. The review remarked that Outliers was repetitive in parts, but that Gladwell eventually pulls the stories together into an overarching narrative.\nCriticism focused on the book's style and oversimplified conceptualizations. Displeased with Gladwell's generalizations drawn from small amounts of data, Roger Gathman wrote in The Austin American-Statesman that this was uncharacteristic of him, and believed that the approach points to a \"certain exhaustion in his favorite method\". He remarked that in Outliers, the experiments, analyses, and conclusions drawn are too mechanically applied to historical or cultural phenomena to \"create a cognitive 'gotcha' moment\", that Gladwell's analytical method was no longer working, and that \"it's high time for Gladwell to produce something more challenging than his beautifully executed tomb robberies of old sociology papers.\" Boyd Tonkin in The Independent held a similar opinion, and wondered why Gladwell \"does not yet hold a tenured professorship at the University of the Bleedin' Obvious\".\nAsk A Korean posted a detailed assessment of Outliers' section on the 1997 Korean Air crash, accusing Gladwell of \"journalistic malpractice\". The blog accuses Gladwell of \"stacking the deck\" against Korean pilots by listing irrelevant air crashes from KAL's history, as well as truncating the pilots' conversation to suit his book's conclusion. The piece accuses Gladwell of \"culturalism\", a concept similar to racism, in suggesting that Koreans are inherently prone to air crashes because of their communication style. The If Books Could Kill podcast criticized the book heavily, noting that its section on Korean Air counts instances of crashes caused by North Korean terrorism and Soviet anti-air attacks as examples of Korean incompetence, in a manner that cannot be explained except by intentional journalistic deception. Similarly, the podcast criticized the section on Asian peoples' exceptional math abilities, claiming that it relies on shoddy personal research and draws conclusions which cannot be supported by the data which Gladwell gathered on math scores. The connections of rice farming to math and inability to drive, three of the most common Asian stereotypes, without sufficient data to prove their relevance was accused of edging on racism, if not racial insensitivity, potentially driven by the perceived post-racism of the 1990s.\nJason Cowley, reviewing the book in The Guardian, felt that Outliers was an argument between Gladwell and himself, referring to the many times that he uses the word \"we\" when defining his position, such as in the example: \"There is something profoundly wrong with the way we look at success. ... We cling to the idea that success is a simple function of individual merit and that the world in which we grow up and the rules we choose to write as a society don't matter at all.\" He also believed that there was a \"certain one-dimensional Americanness at work\", observing that many of Gladwell's examples are from the United States, particularly in New York City.\nIn an article about the book for The New York Times, Steven Pinker wrote, \"The reasoning in 'Outliers,' which consists of cherry-picked anecdotes, post-hoc sophistry and false dichotomies, had me gnawing on my Kindle.\" In a review in The New Republic, Isaac Chotiner called the final two chapters of Outliers \"impervious to all forms of critical thinking\".\nAuthor Ulrich Boser criticized the 10,000 hour rule, pointing out that people do not necessarily get superbly good at handwriting or driving despite huge amounts of practice performing those activities. Boser said that feedback, whether from a coach, tutor, or systematic self-observation, was required to make progress, and could result in speedy improvement.\nFinding it ironic that Outliers provided suggestions on how to resolve cultural biases, the Sunday Times review by Kevin Jackson agreed that the book itself suffered from an unbalanced focus on American subjects, predicting that this would lead to better sales in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Jackson was disappointed in the book's lack of new ideas, noting that it merely expands on the concept that \"you have to be born at the right moment; at the right place; to the right family (posh usually helps); and then you have to work really, really hard. That's about it.\" He was also skeptical towards Gladwell's arguments for the 10,000-Hour Rule by countering that the Beatles' success had more to do with \"the youthful spirit of the age, the vogue for guitar bands and a spark of collaborative chemistry\". Regarding the book, Paul McCartney, former member of the Beatles, said in an interview on August 6, 2010:\n\n[...] I've read the book. I think there is a lot of truth in it [...] I mean there were an awful lot of bands that were out in Hamburg who put in 10,000 hours and didn't make it, so it's not a cast-iron theory. I think, however, when you look at a group who has been successful... I think you always will find that amount of work in the background. But I don't think it's a rule that if you do that amount of work, you're going to be as successful as the Beatles.\nCase Western Reserve University's assistant professor of psychology Brooke N. Macnamara and colleagues have subsequently performed a comprehensive review of 9,331 research papers about practice relating to acquiring skills. They focused specifically on 88 papers that collected and recorded data about practice times. In their paper, they note regarding the 10,000-hour rule that \"This view is a frequent topic of popular-science writing\" but \"we conducted a meta-analysis covering all major domains in which deliberate practice has been investigated. We found that deliberate practice explained 26% of the variance in performance for games, 21% for music, 18% for sports, 4% for education, and less than 1% for professions. We conclude that deliberate practice is important, but not as important as has been argued\".\nSociologist Shayne Lee referenced Outliers in his opinion editorial for CNN.com that commemorated Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. Lee discussed the strategic timing of King's ascent from a \"Gladwellian\" perspective, citing Outliers as the inspiration for his argument.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSummary Archived 2017-07-02 at the Wayback Machine by Dan Dascalescu, about 3250 words",

It is an essential function of the eye that helps spread tears across and remove irritants from the surface of the cornea and conjunctiva.\nBlinking may have other functions since it occurs more often than necessary just to keep the eye lubricated. Researchers think blinking may help with disengagement of attention; following blink onset, cortical activity decreases in the dorsal network and increases in the default-mode network, associated with internal processing. Blink speed can be affected by elements such as fatigue, eye injury, medication, and disease. The blinking rate is determined by the \"blinking center\", but it can also be affected by external stimulus.\nSome animals, such as tortoises and hamsters, blink their eyes independently of each other. Humans use winking, the blinking of only one eye, as a form of body language.\n\n\n== Function and anatomy ==\n\nBlinking provides moisture to the eye by irrigation using tears and a lubricant the eyes secrete. The eyelid provides suction across the eye from the tear duct to the entire eyeball to keep it from drying out.\n\nBlinking also protects the eye from irritants. Eyelashes are hairs which grow from the edges of the upper and lower eyelids that create a line of defense against dust and other elements to the eye. The eyelashes catch most of these irritants before they reach the eyeball.\nThere are multiple muscles that control reflexes of blinking. The main muscles, in the upper eyelid, that control the opening and closing are the orbicularis oculi and levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The orbicularis oculi closes the eye, while the contraction of the levator palpebrae muscle opens the eye. The Müller's muscle, or the superior tarsal muscle, in the upper eyelid and the inferior palpebral muscle in the lower 3 eyelid are responsible for widening the eyes. These muscles are not only imperative in blinking, but they are also important in many other functions such as squinting and winking.  The inferior palpebral muscle is coordinated with the inferior rectus to pull down the lower lid when one looks down.\nThe correlation between human eyelid blink behavior and psychological stress was also demonstrated by means of a laboratory study. Lying may affect the rate of blinking. \nBlinking is used for communication in humans, some primates, in human interactions with cats,  and by female concave-eared torrent frogs to initiate mating with males. \n\n\n=== Central nervous system's control ===\nThough one may think that the stimulus triggering blinking is dry or irritated eyes, it is most likely that it is controlled by a \"blinking center\" of the globus pallidus of the lenticular nucleus—a body of nerve cells between the base and outer surface of the brain.  Nevertheless, external stimuli can contribute. The orbicularis oculi is a facial muscle; therefore its actions are translated by the facial nerve root. The levator palpebrae superioris' action is sent through the oculomotor nerve. The duration of a blink is\non average 100–150 milliseconds according to UCL researcher and between 100 and 400 ms according to the Harvard Database of Useful Biological Numbers. Closures in excess of 1000 ms were defined as microsleeps.\nGreater activation of  dopaminergic pathways dopamine production in the striatum is associated with a higher rate of spontaneous eye blinking. Conditions in which there is reduced dopamine availability such as Parkinson's disease have reduced eye blink rate, while conditions in which it is raised such as schizophrenia have an increased rate. Blink rate is associated with dopamine-related executive function and creativity.\n\n\n=== Evolutionary origins ===\nBlinking is present in all major tetrapod crown groups. The soft tissues involved in blinking have not been preserved in the fossil record, but study of mudskippers (a group of amphibious fish species that evolved blinking independently from other tetrapod species, but for similar purposes), suggest that blinking (which involves the eye retracting in mudskippers) may have arose in response to selective pressures upon species shifting from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. For example, compared to an aquatic environment, in a terrestrial environment, the corneal cells must be kept moist such that vital substances like oxygen can more easily diffuse into them, detritus may adhere to the eye in dry conditions, and objects may move towards the eye at faster and more dangerous speeds in air than in water. Additionally, when at their fully aquatic juvenile stage of development, their eyes are not in the positioning with which they blink, but as adults, their eyes elevate to a position that can blink, which they do when they are not submerged or bump into a surface, suggesting blinking emerged as an adaptation to terrestrial life as opposed to aquatic life.\nEarly tetrapods in the transition to land, which would later yield all non-mudskipper blinking species, possessed similar characteristics regarding eye positioning that suggest blinking arose in response to aerial vision and terrestrial lifestyle.\n\n\n== Types of blinking ==\nThere are three types of blinking.\n\n\n=== Spontaneous blink ===\nSpontaneous blinking is done without external stimuli and internal effort. This type of blinking is conducted in the pre-motor brain stem and happens without conscious effort, like breathing and digestion.\n\n\n=== Reflex blink ===\nA reflex blink occurs in response to an external stimulus, such as contact with the cornea or objects that appear rapidly in front of the eye. A reflex blink is not necessarily a conscious blink either; however it does happen faster than a spontaneous blink. Reflex blink may occur in response to tactile stimuli (e.g., corneal, eyelash, skin of eyelid, contact with eyebrow), optical stimuli (e.g. dazzle reflex, or menace reflex) or auditory stimuli (e.g., menace reflex).\n\n\n=== Voluntary blink ===\nA voluntary blink is a conscious blink, with the use of all 3 divisions of the orbicularis oculi muscle.\n\n\n== Blinking in everyday life ==\n\n\n=== Children ===\nInfants do not blink at the same rate of adults; in fact, infants only blink at an average rate of one or two times in a minute. The reason for this difference is unknown, but it is suggested that infants do not require the same amount of eye lubrication that adults do because their eyelid opening is smaller in relation to adults. Additionally, infants do not produce tears during their first month of life. Infants also get a significant amount more sleep than adults do and, as discussed earlier, fatigued eyes blink more. However, throughout childhood the blink rate increases, and by adolescence, it is usually equivalent to that of adults.\n\n\n=== Adults ===\nThere have been mixed results when studying gender-dependent differences in blinking rates, with results varying from the women's rate nearly doubling the men's to no significant difference between them.  In addition, women using oral contraceptives blink 32% more often than other women on average for unknown reasons. Generally, between each blink is an interval of 2–10 seconds; actual rates vary by individual, averaging around 17 blinks per minute in a laboratory setting. However, when the eyes are focused on an object for an extended period of time, such as when reading, the rate of blinking decreases to about 4 to 5 times per minute. This is the major reason that eyes dry out and become fatigued when reading.\nWhen the eyes dry out or become fatigued due to reading on a computer screen, it can be an indication of computer vision syndrome. Computer vision syndrome can be prevented by taking regular breaks, focusing on objects far from the screen, having a well-lit workplace, or using a blink reminder application. Studies suggest that adults can learn to maintain a healthy blinking rate while reading or looking at a computer screen using biofeedback.\nEye blinking can be a criterion for diagnosing medical conditions. For example, excessive blinking may help to indicate the onset of Tourette syndrome, strokes or disorders of the nervous system. A reduced rate of blinking is associated with Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCorneal reflex\nReflex\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Blinking at Wikimedia Commons",

    "full_narrative": "David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants is a non-fiction book written by Canadian writer Malcolm Gladwell and published by Little, Brown and Company on October 1, 2013. The book focuses on the probability of improbable events occurring in situations where one outcome is greatly favored over the other. The book contains many different stories of these underdogs who wind up beating the odds, the most famous being the story of David and Goliath. Despite generally negative reviews, the book was a bestseller, rising to #4 on The New York Times Hardcover Non-fiction chart, and #5 on USA Today's Best-Selling Books.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe book is partially inspired by an article Gladwell wrote for The New Yorker in 2009 entitled \"How David Beats Goliath\".\n\n\n== Summary ==\nDavid and Goliath employs individual case studies and comparison to provide a wide range of examples where perceived major disadvantages in fact turn out to be the keys to the underdog Davids' triumph against Goliath-like opponents or situations. In one arc, Gladwell cites various seeming afflictions that may in fact have significantly contributed to success, linking dyslexia with the high-flying career of lawyer David Boies, and the loss of a parent at an early age with the exceptional research work of oncologist Emil \"Jay\" Freireich. These anecdotal lessons are anchored by references to research in the social sciences.\nOther examples include: Vivek Ranadive, and a middle school girls' basketball team in Redwood City; Teresa DeBrito, and the impact of class size regulations; Caroline Sacks, and choosing between going to a top-tier college or a second-tier college; David Boies and how he still has a great career despite having or perhaps because of his dyslexia or a desirable difficulty; Jay Freireich and his cancer research, London bombings in World War II, and the effect of \"remote misses\" on the city's morale and a person's courage; activist Wyatt Walker and how he and Martin Luther King Jr. were able to make the Birmingham riot of 1963 a historically significant event in the civil rights movement using Br'er Rabbit-like tactics; Rosemary Lawlor and how the Northern Irish police's reaction to religious riots in Belfast in 1969 led to a 30-year conflict called The Troubles, and contrasting this to how a police officer in New York City created a program that connected with troubled youths and their families; how Mike Reynolds' reaction to a family member being murdered led to the California Three-strikes law and how Wilma Derksen's reaction led to a completely different result; and André Trocmé, a pastor in a small town in the French mountains Le Chambon-sur-Lignon that stood up to the Nazi regime and harbored Jewish refugees.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nCritical response to David and Goliath was largely negative. The book was unfavorably reviewed twice in The New York Times.  Janet Maslin quipped, \"As usual, Mr. Gladwell's science is convenient\", and she concludes that \"the book's middle section is its messiest\", where the author attempts to link the experiences of famous dyslexics such as Brian Grazer and David Boies. Joe Nocera called the book \"deeply repetitive and a bewildering sprawl,\" suggesting that \"[m]aybe what 'David and Goliath' really illustrates is that it's time for Malcolm Gladwell to find a new shtick.\"\nWriting in Esquire, Tom Junod echoed Nocera's conclusion; his review bore the title \"Malcolm Gladwell Runs Out of Tricks\". Junod coined a term called \"The Gladwell Feint\", whereby the author questions the obvious, and asserting that the reader's preconceptions are wrong, before reassuring the reader that he has subconsciously known this all along. The Feint is an algorithm that produces reliably feel-good stories. \"Gladwell might be suspect as a philosopher, but his credentials as the Horatio Alger of late-period capitalism are unsurpassed.\" The New Republic reinforced this critique, calling the book less insightful than a Chinese fortune cookie and topping the review with the headline \"Malcolm Gladwell Is America's Best-Paid Fairy-Tale Writer\". The Wall Street Journal lamented, \"This is an entertaining book. But it teaches little of general import, for the morals of the stories it tells lack solid foundations in evidence and logic.\"\n\"To read David and Goliath is to suffer the discomfort of watching a formidably intelligent author flailing—by citing all manner of social-scientific studies and battering us with charts and tables and graphs—to prove something that no one would disagree with in the first place\", wrote Craig Seligman for Bloomberg News. \"The further I read into David and Goliath, the more irritated I got. I wasn't persuaded there was much of a subject there, but what really bugged me was the tone.\" Seligman concluded, \"[I]n the past I've always felt flattered by Gladwell's writing. I like having things explained to me. But I don't like being talked down to by someone who's telling me things I already know.\"\nHowever, Lucy Kellaway in the Financial Times wrote, \"David and Goliath is Gladwell's most enjoyable book so far. It is a feel-good extravaganza, nourishing both heart and mind… Gladwell is a master at marching us off in one direction, only to end up taking us somewhere else instead—somewhere better.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nLegitimacy (political)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

    "full_narrative": "Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don't Know is a nonfiction book written by Canadian writer Malcolm Gladwell and published by Little, Brown and Company (hardcover version) on September 10, 2019. The audiobook version of the book follows Gladwell's Revisionist History podcast-style structure, using Gladwell's narration, interviews, sound bites, and the theme song \"Hell You Talmbout\".\n\n\n== Summary ==\nTalking to Strangers studies miscommunication, interactions and assumptions people make when dealing with those that they don't know. To make his point, Gladwell covers a variety of events and issues, including the arrest and subsequent death of Sandra Bland; British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's interactions with Adolf Hitler; the sex abuse scandal of Larry Nassar; the Cuban mole Ana Montes; the investment scandal of Bernie Madoff; the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal; the trial of Amanda Knox; the Brock Turner rape case; Sylvia Plath's death; and the Kansas City preventive patrol experiment. The book opens and closes with an analysis of the Sandra Bland case.\nThe book draws from the truth-default theory by psychologist and communication studies professor Timothy R. Levine. \"Default to truth\" is used throughout the book to observe how human beings are by nature trusting, not only of people or technology, but of everything. Sometimes this kind of behavior, the lack of understanding each other, leads to disastrous and tragic outcomes, as elaborated by Gladwell in the stories he brings. Gladwell notes how there are evolutionary social reasons why we trust more than suspect - the need for cooperation being one. Gladwell asserts that defaulting to distrust would be disastrous and that we should \"accept the limits of our ability to decipher strangers\".\nThe audiobook version of the book features voices of people Gladwell interviewed, such as scientists and military psychologists. Court transcripts are re-enacted. The book uses the theme song \"Hell You Talmbout\" by Janelle Monáe.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nReviews by Carol Tavris in The Wall Street Journal and Anthony Gottlieb in The New York Times say that \"the book is not really about strangers\" and the \"title doesn't describe the book\". Gottlieb notes how Bernie Madoff, Jerry Sandusky, Ana Montes, and others deceived not only strangers, but also those familiar and close to them. Tavris notes how the stories in the book are related to people we talk \"about\" rather than those we talk \"to\" in our daily lives. Tavris asserts that the strangers in the book, like Hitler and Bernie Madoff, are not strangers at all, but people who may have been in the news, or someone we knew or admired, before learning more about them changed our entire perception. Andrew Ferguson writes in The Atlantic that Gladwell does not define the word \"stranger\" in the book, and the definition varies according to the story being told.\nGladwell is criticized by more than one reviewer about the quality of his research for the book. Tavris calls him a \"somewhat lazy researcher\". Ferguson in The Atlantic points out that Gladwell referenced \"poets die young\" in the Sylvia Plath anecdote, using a study which had a sample of just 36 \"major poets\" consisting of \"British and Irish poets born between 1705 and 1805\". Out of these 36, two committed suicide, and this is the basis for the following line in Gladwell's book that Ferguson criticizes: \"And of every occupational category, [poets] have far and away the highest suicide rates—as much as five times higher than the general population\". Ferguson also questions the reasoning behind how someone would categorize a \"poet\" into an \"occupational category\", adding that \"at times he (Gladwell) approaches self-parody\". Tavris also criticizes a footnote that she says is \"flat-out wrong\", writing, \"The idea that traumatic memories are repressed and can be retrieved only under the direction of therapy is—to say the least—controversial\". Tavris notes how an underlying theme throughout the book, truth-default theory by psychologist Timothy R. Levine, is used very superficially and without any discussion of the conditions under which \"we default to truth, and when don't we?\" \nTavris asserts that Gladwell's whole point is that we label people too quickly, even without knowing the whole picture; we think that we would be able to recognize evil when it stared us in the face, and how wrong we are in this assumption. Gottlieb writes in The New York Times that \"a little more substance would have been nice\", while Ben East writes in The National that the book has \"no defining, take-home idea\". \nSome critics were moderate in their reception, expressing doubt in Gladwell's ideas but praising other aspects of the book.The Times of India expresses doubt in Gladwell's interpretation of Bland's death, but says that Gladwell's \"writing is as immersive as ever and his storytelling skills are commendable\", and that the book is even for those who like the social sciences or fiction. Brian Naylor of NPR expresses doubt in Gladwell's theories around the sexual assault of Chanel Miller and Bland's case, suggesting that while he is oversimplifying some situations, Gladwell's ideas around perception of strangers still contain good advice.  Andrew Anthony of The Guardian is doubtful of the relationship between the various circumstances Gladwell draws comparisons between, still suggesting the book is \"fascinating study of gullibility and the social necessity of trusting strangers\".\n\n\n== References ==",

    "full_narrative": "Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. Published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow, the book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide.  Based on the success of the original book, Levitt and Dubner have grown the Freakonomics brand into a multi-media franchise, with a sequel book, a feature film, a regular radio segment on National Public Radio, and a weekly blog.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an economist who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by \"traditional\" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:\n\nChapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customers\nChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents\nChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealers\nChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled \"The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime\", written with John Donohue)\nChapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on education\nChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)\nOne example of the authors' use of economic theory involves demonstrating the existence of cheating among sumo wrestlers. In a sumo tournament, all wrestlers in the top division compete in 15 matches and face demotion if they do not win at least eight of them. The sumo community is very close-knit, and the wrestlers at the top levels tend to know each other well. The authors looked at the final match, and considered the case of a wrestler with seven wins, seven losses, and one fight to go, fighting against an 8–6 wrestler. Statistically, the 7–7 wrestler should have a slightly below even chance, since the 8–6 wrestler is slightly better. However, the 7–7 wrestler actually wins around 80% of the time. Levitt uses this statistic and other data gleaned from sumo wrestling matches, along with the effect that allegations of corruption have on match results, to conclude that those who already have eight wins collude with those who are 7–7 and let them win, since they have already secured their position for the following tournament. Following condemnation of the claims by the Japan Sumo Association, the 2011 Grand Tournament in Tokyo was canceled- the first time since 1946 -due to allegations of match-fixing.\nThe authors attempt to demonstrate the power of data mining, as a number of their results emerge from Levitt's analysis of various databases. The authors posit that various incentives encourage teachers to cheat by assisting their students with multiple-choice high-stakes tests. Such cheating in the Chicago school system is inferred from detailed analysis of students' answers to multiple-choice questions. Levitt asks, \"What would the pattern of answers look like if the teacher cheated?\", and hypothesizes that the more difficult questions found at the end of test sections will be answered correctly more frequently than the easy questions at the beginning of test sections.\n\n\n=== Second edition ===\nIn Chapter 2 of Freakonomics, the authors wrote of their visit to folklorist Stetson Kennedy's Florida home where the topic of Kennedy's investigations of the Ku Klux Klan were discussed. However, in their January 8, 2006 column in The New York Times Magazine, Dubner and Levitt wrote of questions about Stetson Kennedy's research (\"Hoodwinked\", pp. 26–28) leading to the conclusion that Kennedy's research was at times embellished for effectiveness.\nIn the \"Revised and Expanded Edition\" this embellishment was noted and corrected: \"Several months after Freakonomics was first published, it was brought to our attention that this man's portrayal of his crusade, and various other Klan matters, was considerably overstated ... we felt it was important to set straight the historical record.\"\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nFreakonomics has been criticized for being a work of sociology or criminology, rather than economics. Israeli economist Ariel Rubinstein criticized the book for making use of dubious statistics and complained that \"economists like Levitt ... have swaggered off into other fields\", saying that the \"connection to economics ... [is] none\" and that the book is an example of \"academic imperialism\". Arnold Kling has suggested the book is an example of \"amateur sociology\".\n\n\n=== The impact of legalized abortion on crime ===\n\nRevisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argue that the legalization of abortion can account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s.  This paper has sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said:\n\nThe numbers we're talking about, in terms of crime, are absolutely trivial when you compare it to the broader debate on abortion. From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing—they are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, my own view, when we [did] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion.\nIn 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt's results (\"Did Legalized Abortion Lower Crime?\" Journal of Human Resources, 2003, 38(1), pp. 1–37). In 2004, the authors published a response, in which they argued that Joyce's argument was flawed due to omitted-variable bias.\nIn November 2005, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz published a working paper, in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt's abortion and crime paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors: the omission of state-year interactions and the use of the total number of arrests instead of the arrest rate in explaining changes in the murder rate. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it and did not affect property crime. They even concluded that the majority of women who had abortions in the 1970s were middle class whites rather than low income minorities as Levitt stated; this was, they stated, because white middle-class women had the financial means for an abortion. The Economist remarked on the news of the errors that \"for someone of Mr Levitt's iconoclasm and ingenuity, technical ineptitude is a much graver charge than moral turpitude. To be politically incorrect is one thing; to be simply incorrect quite another.\"\nIn January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response, in which they admitted the errors in their original paper but also pointed out Foote and Goetz's correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant, contrary to Foote and Goetz's claims. Foote and Goetz, however, soon produced a rebuttal of their own and said that even after analyzing the data using the methods that Levitt and Donohue recommend, the data does not show a positive correlation between abortion rates and crime rates. They are quick to point out that this does not necessarily disprove Levitt's thesis, however, and emphasize that with data this messy and incomplete, it is in all likelihood not even possible to prove or disprove Donohue and Levitt's conclusion.\nFreakonomics commented on the effects of an abortion ban in Romania (Decree 770), stating that \"Compared to Romanian children born just a year earlier, the cohort of children born after the abortion ban would do worse in every measurable way: they would test lower in school, they would have less success in the labor market, and they would also prove much more likely to become criminals. (p. 118)\". John DiNardo, a professor at the University of Michigan, retorts that the paper cited by Freakonomics states \"virtually the opposite of what is actually claimed\":\n\nOn average, children born in 1967 just after abortions became illegal display better educational and labor market achievements than children born prior to the change. This outcome can be explained by a change in the composition of women having children: urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, so a higher proportion of children were born into urban, educated households. (Pop-Eleches, 2002, p. 34).\nLevitt responded on the Freakonomics Blog that Freakonomics and Pop-Eleches \"are saying the same thing\":\n\nHere is the abstract of the version of the Pop-Eleches paper that we cited:\n...Children born after the abortion ban attained more years of schooling and greater labor market success. This is because urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, and the relative number of children born to this type of woman increased after the ban. However, controlling for composition using observable background variables, children born after the ban on abortions had worse educational and labor market achievements as adults. Additionally, I provide evidence of crowding in the school system and some suggestive evidence that cohorts born after the introduction of the abortion ban had higher infant mortality and increased criminal behavior later in life.\nThe introduction of the Pop-Eleches paper says:\n\nThis finding is consistent with the view that children who were unwanted during pregnancy had worse socio-economic outcomes once they became adults.\n\n\n=== Effects of extra police on crime ===\nFreakonomics claimed that it was possible to \"tease out\" the effect of extra police on crime by analyzing electoral cycles. The evidence behind these claims was shown to be due partly to a programming error. Economist Justin McCrary stated \"While municipal police force size does appear to vary over state and local electoral cycles ... elections do not induce enough variation in police hiring to generate informative estimates of the effect of police on crime.\"\n\n\n=== Defamation case ===\nOn April 10, 2006, political activist John Lott filed suit for defamation against Levitt and HarperCollins Publishers over the book and a series of emails to retired economist John B. McCall. In the book, Levitt and coauthor Dubner claimed that the results of Lott's research in More Guns, Less Crime had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of The Journal of Law and Economics had not been peer-reviewed, alleged that Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.\nA federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in Freakonomics was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint about the email claims.\nLevitt settled the second defamation claim by admitting in a letter to McCall that he himself was a peer reviewer in the 2001 issue of The Journal of Law and Economics, that Lott had not engaged in bribery (paying for extra costs of printing and postage for a conference issue is customary), and that he knew that \"scholars with varying opinions\" (including Levitt himself) had been invited to participate. The Chronicle of Higher Education characterized Levitt's letter as offering \"a doozy of a concession\".\nThe dismissal of the first half of Lott's suit was unanimously upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on February 11, 2009.\n\n\n== Publishing history ==\nFreakonomics peaked at number two among nonfiction on The New York Times Best Seller list and was named the 2006 Book Sense Book of the Year in the Adult Nonfiction category.\n\n \nThe success of the book has been partly attributed to the blogosphere. In the campaign prior to the release of the book in April 2005, the publisher (William Morrow and Company) chose to target bloggers in an unusually strategic way, sending galley copies to over a hundred of them, as well as contracting two specialized buzz marketing agencies.\nIn 2006 the Revised and Expanded Edition of the book was published, with the most significant corrections in the second chapter.\n\n\n== Progression ==\n\n\n=== Freakonomics blog ===\nThe authors started their own Freakonomics blog in 2005.\nIn May 2007, writer and blogger Melissa Lafsky was hired as the full-time editor of the site. In August 2007, the blog was incorporated into The New York Times' web site – the authors had been writing joint columns for The New York Times Magazine since 2004 – and the domain Freakonomics.com became a redirect there. In March 2008, Annika Mengisen replaced Lafsky as the blog editor.  The Freakonomics blog ended its association with The New York Times on March 1, 2011.\nAmong the recurrent guest bloggers on the Freakonomics blog are Ian Ayres, Daniel Hamermesh, Eric A. Morris, Sudhir Venkatesh, Justin Wolfers and others.\nIn 2008, Stephen Dubner asked for questions from the site's readers and then featured them in an extended Q&A on \"Best Places to Live\" with demographics expert Bert Sperling.\n\n\n=== SuperFreakonomics ===\n\nIn April 2007, co-author Stephen Dubner announced that there would be a sequel to Freakonomics, and that it would contain further writings about street gang culture from Sudhir Venkatesh, as well as a study of the use of money by capuchin monkeys. Dubner said the title would be SuperFreakonomics, and that one topic would be what makes people good at what they do. The book was released in Europe in early October 2009 and in the United States on October 20, 2009.\n\n\n=== Freakonomics radio ===\n\nIn September 2010, Marketplace radio announced the creation of a Freakonomics podcast hosted by Dubner and Levitt. It is available on iTunes and is aired bi-weekly on NPR.\n\n\n=== Film adaptation ===\n\nIn 2010, Chad Troutwine, Chris Romano, and Dan O'Meara produced a documentary film adaptation with a budget of nearly $3 million in an anthology format by directors Seth Gordon, Morgan Spurlock, Alex Gibney, Eugene Jarecki, Rachel Grady, and Heidi Ewing. It was the Closing Night Gala premiere film at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 30, 2010. It was also the Opening Night film at the AFI/Discovery SilverDocs film festival on June 21, 2010. Magnolia Pictures acquired distribution rights for a Fall 2010 release.\nFreakonomics: The Movie was released in major cities with a pay what you want pricing offer for selected preview showings.  No report of the results has yet been published.\n\n\n=== Freakonomics Consulting Group ===\nIn 2009, Levitt co-founded Freakonomics Consulting Group, a business and philanthropy consulting company which became The Greatest Good and is now known as TGG Group. Founding partners include Nobel laureates Daniel Kahneman and Gary Becker, as well as several other prominent economists.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJohn DiNardo (2006). \"Freakonomics: Scholarship in the Service of Storytelling\" (PDF).

    "full_narrative": "SuperFreakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes, and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance is the second non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and The New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner, released in early October 2009 in Europe and on October 20, 2009 in the United States. It is a sequel to Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe explanatory note states that the theme of the book explores the concept that all people work for a particular reward. The introduction states people should look at problems economically. The examples given include the preference for sons in India and the hardships Indian women face, as well as the horse manure issue at the turn of the 20th century.\nThe first chapter explores prostitution and pimps in South Chicago, one high class escort, and real estate brokers. The pimps and brokers are compared based on the idea that they are helping to sell one's services to the larger market. Inequalities in pay grades for men and women are also covered in the chapter.\nThe second chapter is about patterns and details. Patterns in the ages of soccer players, health issues of children in the womb during Ramadan, and the upbringings of terrorists are observed. Next, the book discusses the skills of hospital doctors and how Azyxxi was created, and draws parallels to how terrorists in the UK were tracked down by banks.\nAltruism is discussed in the third chapter, and uses examples of the murder of Kitty Genovese, crime rates as affected by television, and economic experimental games such as prisoner's dilemma, ultimatum, and the work of John A. List.\nThe fourth chapter is about unintended consequences and simple fixes. It goes into detail about Ignaz Semmelweis' work in hospitals, use of seatbelts and child seats, and the possibility of reducing hurricanes.\nThe fifth chapter discusses externalities and global warming. It discusses how economics does not necessarily take environmental issues into account. While interviewing Nathan Myhrvold and Ken Caldeira from Intellectual Ventures, the authors posit an alternative way of solving global warming by stratospheric aerosol injection.\nThe epilogue is about microeconomics, and discusses a study by Laurie Santos and Keith Chen as to whether capuchin monkeys can be trained to use money.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSuperFreakonomics has been praised for its entertainment value, but has drawn criticism for taking unconventional approaches to its subject matter, particularly global warming.\nIn the Financial Times, Tim Harford, author of The Undercover Economist, said that SuperFreakonomics \"is a lot like Freakonomics, but better.\" BusinessWeek gave the book three and a half stars out of five, saying that the book is \"[a]n inventive and even useful application of economics to unusual subjects\".\n\n\n=== Global warming section ===\nIn the book's fifth chapter, the author proposes that the climate system can be intentionally regulated by construction of a stratoshield or a fleet of marine cloud seeders.\nThe chapter has been criticized by economists and climate science experts who say it contains numerous misleading statements and discredited arguments.  Among the critics are Paul Krugman, Brad DeLong, Raymond Pierrehumbert, The Guardian, Bloomberg News, and The Economist.  Elizabeth Kolbert, a science writer for The New Yorker who has written extensively on global warming, contends that \"just about everything they [Levitt and Dubner] have to say on the topic is, factually speaking, wrong.\"\nJoseph Romm said that SuperFreakonomics had seriously misrepresented the position of climate scientist Ken Caldeira; the book says among other things, that Caldeira's research tells him CO2 is \"not the right villain\", an assertion Caldeira strongly disputes. \n\nCaldeira has commented I believe all of the ideas attributed to me are based on fact, with the exception of the 'carbon dioxide is not the right villain' line. That said, when I am speaking, I place these facts in a very different context and draw different policy conclusions.... I believe the authors to have worked in good faith. They draw different conclusions than I draw from the same facts, but as authors of the book, that is their prerogative.\nDubner responded that with hindsight the line describing Ken Caldeira overstated his position, but noted that Caldeira had been sent a preview of the text and had approved it.\nCaldeira has acknowledged that he did receive the preview, but disagreed that the errors were his responsibility: \"I feel no need to read, fact check, or make detailed comments on documents that arrive in my in-box. I have lots of other things to do, like trying to get my science out the door.\"\nAs it transpired, Dubner had been apprised of Caldeira's objection to the \"right villain\" assertion, but did not delete the line as Caldeira expected, although Caldeira believes this was due to a good faith misunderstanding.\nRegarding their own views on global warming, Levitt and Dubner have stated on their Freakonomics blog that global warming is \"a man-made phenomenon\" and \"an important issue to solve\". They go on to explain that where they differ with the establishment view is in what the most effective solutions to that problem are.\nFor an establishment review of how Levitt and Dubner use arithmetic in their dismissal of the solar photovoltaic option to mitigate global warming, see Raymond Pierrehumbert's open letter to Steven Levitt at Realclimate.org.\n\n\n== Illustrated edition ==\nIn 2010, Levitt and Dubner released an illustrated edition of SuperFreakonomics.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGlobal warming controversy\nScientific opinion on climate change\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site\nBook page at Harper Collins\nSuperFreakonomics at SourceWatch\nSuperFreakonomics webcast – Levitt & Dubner on The Ultimatum Game\nWashington Post review of SuperFreakonomics, November 15, 2009\nAfter Words interview with Levitt and Dubner on SuperFreakonomics, October 26, 2009",

    "full_narrative": "Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions is a 2008 book by Dan Ariely, in which he challenges readers' assumptions about making decisions based on rational thought.

I hope to lead you there by presenting a wide range of scientific experiments, findings, and anecdotes that are in many cases quite amusing. Once you see how systematic certain mistakes are—how we repeat them again and again—I think you will begin to learn how to avoid some of them\". \nThe book has been republished in a \"revised & expanded edition\", and has been adapted as the 2023 television series The Irrational.\n\n\n== Chapter summary ==\nAriely discusses many modes of thinking and situations that may skew the traditional rational choice theory. There are 15 chapters in total, and the following outline the main points.\n\n\n=== The Truth About Relativity ===\nIn chapter 1, Ariely describes the ways in which people frequently regard their environment in terms of their relation to others; it is the way that the human brain is wired. People not only compare things, but also compare things that are easily comparable. For example, if given the following options for a honeymoon—Paris (with free breakfast), Rome (with free breakfast), and Rome (no breakfast included), most people would probably choose Rome with the free breakfast. The rationale is that it is easier to compare the two options for Rome than it is to compare Paris and Rome. Ariely also explains the role of the decoy effect (or asymmetric dominance effect) in the decision process. The decoy effect is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. This effect is the \"secret agent\" in many decisions. In the example with the honeymoon options, Rome without free breakfast is the decoy. (It makes Rome with breakfast look superior to Rome without breakfast.  Comparing Rome and Paris is difficult, so the easy comparison of Rome makes it more likely to choose Rome over Paris.)  It makes Paris look inferior when compared to Rome with the free breakfast. Relativity helps people make decisions but it can also make them miserable. People compare their lives to those of others, leading to jealousy and inferiority. Ariely finishes the chapter by saying \"the more we have, the more we want\" and his suggested cure is to break the cycle of relativity. To break the cycle, people can control what goes on around them. The focus on smaller \"circles\" can boost relative happiness, as can changing this focus from narrow to broad. When considering upgrading a phone, the consumer could think about what else they could buy with the money they would spend on the upgrade.\nThe chapter also explores the independence of irrelevant alternatives and the idea of menu dependence.\n\n\n=== The Fallacy of Supply and Demand ===\n\nIn chapter 2, consumers purchase items based on value, quality or availability—often on all three. The methods of appointing a value to an object with no previous value, like the Tahitian black pearl, is susceptible to irrational pricing. A value can be as easily (arbitrarily) assigned as by having a fancy ad with \"equally\" precious items and a high price tag in a window of a store on Fifth Avenue. When consumers buy a product at a certain price, they become \"anchored\" to that price, i.e. they associate the initial price with the same product over a period of time. An anchor price of a certain object, say a plasma television, will affect the way they perceive the value of all plasma televisions henceforth. Other prices will seem low or high in relation to the original anchor. In other words, decisions about future LCD television purchases become coherent after an initial price has been established in the consumer's mind. A person's self value for services rendered can also be affected by anchor prices; one can irrationally price his/her abilities or services based on an anchor price proposed. Using the concepts of anchor price and arbitrary coherence, Ariely challenges the theory of supply and demand. He states that demand, the determinant of market prices, can be easily manipulated. Furthermore, supply and demand are dependent on each other (manufacturer's suggested retail prices affect consumers' willingness to pay). Finally, the author claims that the relationships between supply and demand are based on memory rather than on preferences.\n\n\n=== The Cost of Zero Cost ===\nIn chapter 3, Ariely explains how humans react to the words \"free\" and \"zero\". Humans make decisions without rationalizing the outcomes of their choices.  To illustrate this point, Ariely conducted multiple experiments.  The outcome was consistent: when faced with multiple choices, the free option was commonly chosen.  With the opportunity to receive something for free, the actual value of the product or service is no longer considered.  Ariely claims, \"Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but when something is FREE! we forget the downside.  FREE! gives us such an emotional charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is.\"\nAriely's concept of \"FREE!\" applies not only to monetary and quantitative costs, but also to time.  We forgo some of our time when we wait in line for free popcorn or to enter a museum on a free-entrance day. We could have been doing something else at that time. Ultimately, he demonstrates how such a simple concept can be used to drive business and social policy.  For example, to reduce health cost, companies could offer free regular checks. Employees would be more willing to get them at zero cost rather than paying some amount of money. Ariely recommends the consideration of the net benefits of the choices we make regarding both preference and money.  Perhaps we would get the better deal and even save money if we did not react to free the way we do.\n\n\n=== Being Paid vs. A Friendly Favor ===\nIn chapters 4 and 5, Ariely speaks in great detail of the differences between social norms—which include friendly requests with instant payback not being required—and market norms—which account for wages, prices, rents, cost benefits, and repayment being essential.\nHe also explains how combining the two can create troubling situations. The author comments that people are happy to do things occasionally when they are not paid for them. In fact there are some situations in which work output is negatively affected by payment of small amounts of money. Tests showed that work done as a \"favor\" sometimes produced much better results than work paid for.\nFor example, some lawyers were asked by AARP to provide needy retirees with services at a cost of about $30. The lawyers did not accept the offer. However, when asked to offer services at no cost, they agreed. Experiments also showed that offering a small gift would not offend anybody (the gift falls into social norms), but mentioning the monetary value of the gifts invokes market norms.\nAriely talks about how social norms are making their way into the market norms. To illustrate, State Farm's slogan, \"Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there,\" provides an example where companies are trying to connect with people on a social level in order to gain trust and allow the customer to overlook minor infractions. The author concludes that \"money, as it turns out, is the most expensive way to motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper, but often more effective as well.\"\n\n\n=== Emotion in Decision Making ===\nIn chapter 6, Ariely collaborated with close friend George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, to test the influence of arousal on decision making in high-emotion situations. Ariely and Loewenstein chose to test the effects of sexual arousal on decision-making in college-aged men at University of California, Berkeley. By using computers to stimulate sexual arousal, they determined that in a stimulated state, the young men were more likely to undergo an action that they would not normally consider. Using the data, Ariely argues that other high-emotion situations such as anger, frustration, and hunger have the potential to trigger similar effects on decision-making. In such situations our behavior is fully controlled by emotions. We are not the people we thought we were. No matter how much experience we have we make irrational decisions every time we are under the influence of arousal. Furthermore, he presents ideas to improve our decision-making abilities in other emotion-provoking situations such as safe sex, safe driving, and making other life decisions.  For example, Ariely proposes an OnStar system that could potentially lower the number of car accidents in teenagers by performing tasks such as changing the car's temperature or dialing the teenager's mother when the car exceeds a set speed.\n\n\n=== The Problem of Procrastination and Self-control ===\nIn chapter 7, over the last decade Americans have shown surprisingly little self-control. Ariely blames this lack of self-control on people's two states in which they make their judgments—cool state and hot state. In our cool state we make rational long-term decisions, whereas in our hot state we give in to immediate gratification and put off our decisions made in the cool state.\nAriely describes putting off these goals for immediate gratification as procrastination. With proper motivators such as deadlines and penalties, people are more willing to meet deadlines or long-term goals. The author states that based on his experience with his students, deadlines set by authority figures such as teachers and supervisors make us start working on a specific task earlier. If we set the deadlines ourselves, we might not perform well. Moreover, we will not start making any progress towards the completion of the task until the deadline approaches.\nAriely also applies his theories to other aspects in life such as health care and savings. Having to pay a deposit at the doctor's office would make people more likely not to procrastinate and show up for their appointments. He goes on to say that if more consequences were put into effect, people would be more likely to meet their goals, appointments, deadlines, etc. made in a cool state. Ariely also elaborates on his idea of self-control credit cards. When applying for such a card, users can decide how much they can spend in each category and what would happen when they exceed their limit.\n\n\n=== The High Price of Ownership ===\nIn chapter 8, Ariely discusses how we overvalue what we have, and why we make irrational decisions about ownership. The idea of ownership makes us perceive the value of an object to be much higher if we own the object.  This illustrates the phenomenon of the endowment effect—placing a higher value on property once possession has been assigned. The author begins the chapter by using an example of how a lottery for highly sought-after Duke University basketball tickets inflates students' sense of value for the tickets.  Students who actually received the tickets valued them ten times more than the students who did not receive them.\nAriely gives three reasons why we do not always think rationally when it comes to our possessions:\n\nOwnership is such a big part of our society that we tend to focus on what we may lose rather than on what we may gain.\nThe connection we feel to the things we own makes it difficult for us to dispose of them.\nWe assume that people will see the transaction through our eyes.\nAriely also lists the \"peculiarities\" of ownership as he calls them. One of them is that the harder we work on something, the more we start feeling about them as our own. Take assembling a piece of furniture as an example. Another peculiarity is that sometimes, the sense of ownership comes before the actual ownership, e.g. online auctions. To avoid the endowment effect, Ariely suggests that we create a barrier between ourselves and the material things we are tempted by daily.\n\n\n=== The Effect of Expectations ===\nIn chapter 9, Ariely and other colleagues conducted a series of experiments to determine whether previous knowledge can change an actual sensory experience. One of the experiments was conducted in the Muddy Charles, one of the MIT's pubs. Students visiting the pub tasted two types of beer—Budweiser and the MIT Brew (which contains balsamic vinegar).\nIn the \"blind test\" the majority preferred the altered brew, but when they were told in advance that it was vinegar-laced, they chose the original Budweiser. Another group of students was made aware of the vinegar content immediately after tasting both kinds of drinks. However, they still reported that they preferred it, proving that knowledge after the experience does not affect our sensory perceptions.\nAriely also states that expectations shape stereotypes. Stereotypes provide us with knowledge before the actual experience and thus influence our perceptions. The author describes an experiment in which an objective math exam was administered to two groups of Asian-American women.  Before taking the test, the women from the first group were asked questions regarding gender-related issues, whereas the second group had to answer questions about race-related issues. The second group did better than the first one and met the expectation that Asians are good at math.\nAriely concludes, \"Expectations can influence nearly every aspect in one's life.\" He presents an argument that expectations can override our senses, partially blinding us from the truth.\n\n\n=== The Power of Placebo ===\nIn chapter 10, Ariely started out with a medical procedure called internal mammary artery ligation for chest pain. The interesting twist is when a cardiologist decided to test the efficacy of this procedure by performing a placebo procedure. The result showed that the placebo is equally effective, thereby disputing the effectiveness of the original surgery. This example is one of many that illustrate the power of placebo in medical science.\nWhile the effect of placebo has been knowingly and unknowingly practiced for millennia, the interesting observation Ariely and his collaborators made was that prices of the prescribed medicine can be used as a placebo as well. This chapter ended with a complex and moral question as to whether or not the placebo effect in medicine should be studied more closely or even eliminated systematically.\n\n\n== Television adaptation ==\n\nIn November 2021, it was reported that NBC had put a pilot commitment to a television series adaptation of the book titled The Irrational with Arika Lisanne Mittman as executive producer. In February 2022, it was announced that NBC had given the production a pilot order. In December 2022, it was announced that NBC had given the production a series order with Jesse L. Martin set to star. In May 2023, it was announced that the series would premiere in the 2023–24 television season. The series premiered on September 25, 2023.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a New York Times review, David Berreby said \"Predictably Irrational is a far more revolutionary book than its unthreatening manner lets on. It's a concise summary of why today's social science increasingly treats the markets-know-best model as a fairy tale.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nCognitive bias\nDysrationalia\nRational choice theory\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== General and cited references ==\nAriely, Dan (2008).

    "full_narrative": "Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness is a book written by University of Chicago economist and Nobel laureate Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein, first published in 2008. In 2021, a revised edition was released, subtitled The Final Edition.\nThe book draws on research in psychology and behavioral economics to defend libertarian paternalism and active engineering of choice architecture. The book also popularized the concept of nudge theory. A nudge, according to Thaler and Sunstein is any form of choice architecture that alters people's behaviour in a predictable way without restricting options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must require minimal intervention and must be cheap.\nThe book received largely positive reviews. The Guardian described it as \"never intimidating, always amusing and elucidating: a jolly economic romp but with serious lessons within.\" It was named one of the best books of 2008 by The Economist.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Human behavior ===\nOne of the main justifications for Thaler's and Sunstein's endorsement of libertarian paternalism in Nudge draws on facts of human nature and psychology. The book is critical of the homo economicus view of human beings \"that each of us thinks and chooses unfailingly well, and thus fits within the textbook picture of human beings offered by economists\".\nThey cite many examples of research which raise \"serious questions about the rationality of many judgments and decisions that people make\". They state that, unlike members of homo economicus, members of the species homo sapiens make predictable mistakes because of their use of heuristics, fallacies, and because of the way they are influenced by their social interactions.\n\n\n==== Two systems of thinking ====\nThe book describes two systems that characterize human thinking, which Sunstein and Thaler refer to as the \"Reflective System\" and the \"Automatic System\". These two systems are more thoroughly defined in Daniel Kahneman's book Thinking, Fast and Slow.\nThe Automatic System is \"rapid and is or feels instinctive, and it does not involve what we usually associate with the word thinking\". Instances of the Automatic System at work include smiling upon seeing a puppy, getting nervous while experiencing air turbulence, and ducking when a ball is thrown at you.\nThe Reflective System is deliberate and self-conscious. It is the one at work when people decide which college to attend, where to go on trips, and (under most circumstances) whether or not to get married.\n\n\n==== Fallacies and biases ====\nBecause of these differences and conflicts between these systems, people are often subject to making mistakes that are the result of widely occurring biases, heuristics, and fallacies. These include:\n\n\n=== Libertarian paternalism ===\nLibertarian paternalism (also called soft paternalism) is the union of two political notions commonly viewed as being at odds: libertarianism and paternalism.\nSunstein and Thaler state that \"the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so\". The paternalistic portion of the term \"lies in the claim that it is legitimate for choice architects to try to influence people's behavior in order to make their lives longer, healthier, and better\".\nChoice architecture describes the way in which decisions are influenced by how the choices are presented. People can be \"nudged\" by arranging the choice architecture in a certain way without taking away the individual's freedom of choice. A simple example of a nudge would be placing healthy foods in a school cafeteria at eye level while putting less-healthy junk food in harder-to-reach places. Individuals are not actually prevented from eating whatever they want, but arranging the food choices that way causes people to eat less junk food and more healthy food.\n\n\n=== Policy recommendations ===\nSunstein and Thaler apply the idea of nudges in the context of choice architecture to propose policy recommendations in the spirit of libertarian paternalism. They have recommendations in the areas of finance, health, the environment, schools, and marriage. They believe these problems can at least be partially addressed by improving the choice architecture.\n\n\n==== Retirement saving ====\nThaler and Sunstein point out that many Americans are not saving enough for retirement. They state that \"in 2005 the personal savings rate for Americans was negative for the first time since 1932 and 1933 – the Great Depression years\".\nOne change they offer is creating better default plans for employees. Employees would be able to adopt any plan they like, but, if no action is taken, they would automatically be enrolled in an expertly designed program [such as social security]. They also propose what they refer to as the \"Save More Tomorrow\" plan. This is to address the issue of people having the desire to save more, yet procrastinating on actually doing so. This program would invite \"participants to commit themselves, in advance, to a series of contribution increases timed to coincide with pay raises\".\n\n\n==== Health care ====\nThe book contains an analysis of the Bush administration program Medicare Part D. Thaler and Sunstein state that \"on some dimensions, Bush was on the right track\" with the plan, but that, \"as a piece of choice architecture...it suffered from a cumbersome design that impeded good decision making\". Specifically, they think that default choices for programs should not have been random and that beneficiaries of the program were not given adequate resources to deal with the number of choices they were faced with. They think that seniors who did not sign up for a program should have one assigned to them, and that, yearly, they should be mailed an itemized list of all drugs they had used and all of the fees they incurred. This information would be freely available online so beneficiaries could easily compare their programs with other similar ones.\nSunstein and Thaler also propose a way to increase organ donation rates in the United States. They argue that a mandated choice program should be put in place, where, in order for someone to renew their driver's license, they must say whether or not they would like to be an organ donor. They also advocate the creation of websites which would suggest that the wider community supports organ donation in order to nudge people into becoming organ donors themselves.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThaler came up with the term \"libertarian paternalism\" in a discussion with Casey B. Mulligan and then continued to discuss the term during a weekly lunch with Cass Sunstein. In 2003, Thaler and Sunstein cowrote articles on the topic for the American Economic Review and the University of Chicago Law Review.\nThaler's name appears first because the book is based mostly on his research, and the authors decided that every chapter would be written in Thaler's voice. The money was split evenly between the two authors.\nThaler wanted the subtitle to be The Gentle Power of Choice Architecture.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nGeorge Will's review for Newsweek magazine stated that \"nudges have the additional virtue of annoying those busybody, nanny-state liberals who, as the saying goes, do not care what people do as long as it is compulsory\".\nBritish journalist Bryan Appleyard, in a review for The Times, was critical of the book, describing it as a \"very, very dull read, a dogged march through social policies with boring lists of what nudges should be imposed and how\" and that \"what the book needs is not more examples but more elaboration of the central idea\".\nChristopher Shea wrote for The Washington Post that \"In the end, it must be said, the profusion of proposals in Nudge, however worthy, and the countless summaries of studies supporting them grow a bit wearisome. As influential as the book is likely to be, it's hard to imagine it pushing its way alongside Malcolm Gladwell's Blink (inferior social science, far breezier style) on the bestseller list\".\nElizabeth Kolbert writing for The New Yorker held reservations about some of the book's conclusions when she wrote that\n\nmany of the suggestions in Nudge seem like good ideas, and even, as with “Save More Tomorrow,” practical ones. The whole project, though, as Thaler and Sunstein acknowledge, raises some pretty awkward questions. If the “nudgee” can’t be depended on to recognize his own best interests, why stop at a nudge? Why not offer a “push,” or perhaps even a “shove”? And if people can’t be trusted to make the right choices for themselves how can they possibly be trusted to make the right decisions for the rest of us?\nIn July 2011, a subgroup of the UK House of Lords Science and Technology Committee concluded a year-long review of behavioral change based on 148 written submissions and evidence from 70 witnesses. The review was led by Baroness Neuberger. In an interview with The Guardian newspaper, Baroness Neuberger reports finding \"precious little\" evidence for effective impact of Nudge:\n\nYou need more than just nudge ... Behavioural change interventions appear to work best when they're part of a package of regulation and fiscal measures ... all politicians love quick fixes ... one of the problems with all of this is if you really want to change people's behaviour it takes a very long time ... you have to look at a 20- to 25-year span before you get a full change of behaviour.\nAmerican law professor Pierre Schlag notes that, for all their attention to framing issues, Sunstein and Thaler neglect a number of important questions: \"(1) What to optimize? (2) When is a nudge a shove? (3) Should we prefer experts? and (4) When do we nudge?\"\nGerd Gigerenzer, a psychologist, in his 2015 article \"On the Supposed Evidence for Libertarian Paternalism,\" wrote, \"Since the publication of Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) Nudge, almost everything that affects behavior has been renamed a nudge, which renders this concept meaningless.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nBehavioural Insights Team\nNudge theory\nSludge theory\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThaler, Richard H.; Sunstein, Cass R.

The prevailing belief was that women who were truly feminine should not want to work, get an education, or have political opinions. Friedan wanted to prove that women were unsatisfied and could not voice their feelings.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nThe Feminine Mystique begins with an introduction describing what Friedan called \"the problem that has no name\"—the widespread unhappiness of women in the 1950s and early 1960s. She discusses the lives of several housewives from around the United States who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being married with children. Friedan also questions the women's magazine, women's education system, and advertisers for creating this widespread image of women. The detrimental effects induced by this image were that it cornered women into the domestic sphere, and that it led many women to lose their own identities.\nChapter 1: Friedan points out that the average age of marriage was dropping, the portion of women attending college was decreasing and the birthrate was increasing for women throughout the 1950s, yet the widespread trend of unhappy women persisted, although American culture insisted that fulfillment for women could be found in marriage and housewifery. Although aware of and sharing this dissatisfaction, women in the 1950s misinterpreted it as an individual problem and rarely talked about it with other women. As Friedan pointed out, \"part of the strange newness of the problem is that it cannot be understood in terms of the age-old material problems of man: poverty, sickness, hunger, cold.\" This chapter concludes by declaring: \"We can no longer ignore that voice within women that says: 'I want something more than my husband and my children and my home.'\"\nChapter 2: Friedan states that the editorial decisions concerning women's magazines at the time were being made mostly by men, who insisted on stories and articles that showed women as either happy housewives or unhappy careerists, thus creating the \"feminine mystique\"—the idea that women were naturally fulfilled by devoting their lives to being housewives and mothers. Friedan also states that this is in contrast to the 1930s, at which time women's magazines often featured confident and independent heroines, many of whom were involved in careers.\nChapter 3: Friedan recalls her own decision to conform to society's expectations by giving up her promising career in psychology to raise children, and shows that other young women still struggled with the same kind of decision. Many women dropped out of school early to marry, afraid that if they waited too long or became too educated, they would not be able to attract a husband. Friedan argues at the end of the chapter that although theorists discuss how men need to find their identity, women are expected to be autonomous. She states, \"Anatomy is woman's destiny, say the theorists of femininity; the identity of woman is determined by her biology.\" Friedan goes on to argue that the problem is women needing to mature and find their human identity: \"In a sense that goes beyond any woman's life, I think this is a crisis of women growing up—a turning point from an immaturity that has been called femininity to full human identity.\"\nChapter 4: Friedan discusses early American feminists and how they fought against the assumption that the proper role of a woman was to be solely a wife and mother. She notes that they secured important rights for women, including education, the right to pursue a career, and the right to vote.\nChapter 5: In this chapter, Friedan, who had a degree in psychology, criticizes the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (whose ideas were very influential in the United States at the time of the book's publication). She notes that Freud saw women as childlike and destined to be housewives, once pointing out that Freud wrote, \"I believe that all reforming action in law and education would break down in front of the fact that, long before the age at which a man can earn a position in society, Nature has determined woman's destiny through beauty, charm, and sweetness. Law and custom have much to give women that has been withheld from them, but the position of women will surely be what it is: in youth an adored darling and in mature years a loved wife.\" Friedan also points out that Freud's unproven concept of \"penis envy\" had been used to label women who wanted careers as neurotic, and that the popularity of Freud's work and ideas elevated the \"feminine mystique\" of female fulfillment in housewifery into a \"scientific religion\" that most women were not educated enough to criticize.\nChapter 6: Friedan criticizes functionalism, which attempted to make the social sciences more credible by studying the institutions of society as if they were parts of a social body, as in biology. Institutions were studied in terms of their function in society, and women were confined to their sexual biological roles as housewives and mothers as well as told that doing otherwise would upset the social balance. Friedan points out that this is unproven and that Margaret Mead, a prominent functionalist, had a flourishing career as an anthropologist.\nChapter 7: Friedan discusses the change in women's education from the 1940s to the early 1960s, in which many women's schools concentrated on non-challenging classes that focused mostly on marriage, family, and other subjects deemed suitable for women, as educators influenced by functionalism felt that too much education would spoil women's femininity and capacity for sexual fulfillment. Friedan says that this change in education arrested girls in their emotional development at a young age, because they never had to face the painful identity crisis and subsequent maturation that comes from dealing with many adult challenges.\nChapter 8: Friedan notes that the uncertainties and fears during World War II and the Cold War made Americans long for the comfort of home, so they tried to create an idealized home life with the father as breadwinner and the mother as housewife. Friedan notes that this was helped along by the fact that many of the women who worked during the war filling jobs previously held by men faced dismissal, discrimination, or hostility when the men returned, and that educators blamed over-educated, career-focused mothers for the maladjustment of soldiers in World War II. Yet as Friedan shows, later studies found that overbearing mothers, not careerists, were the ones who raised maladjusted children.\nChapter 9: Friedan shows that advertisers tried to encourage housewives to think of themselves as professionals who needed many specialized products in order to do their jobs, while discouraging housewives from having actual careers, since that would mean they would not spend as much time and effort on housework and therefore would not buy as many household products, cutting into advertisers' profits. Critics of this theory point out that under the circumstances men, not women, would be buying these household products and women having actual careers would increase women's buying power while increasing advertisers profits.\nChapter 10: Friedan interviews several full-time housewives, finding that although they are not fulfilled by their housework, they are all extremely busy with it. She postulates that these women unconsciously stretch their home duties to fill the time available, because the feminine mystique has taught women that this is their role, and if they ever complete their tasks they will become unneeded.\nChapter 11: Friedan notes that many housewives have sought fulfillment in sex, unable to find it in housework and children. She notes that sex cannot fulfill all of a person's needs, and that attempts to do so often drive married women to have affairs or drive their husbands away as they become obsessed with sex.\nChapter 12: Friedan discusses the fact that many children have lost interest in life or emotional growth, attributing the change to the mother's own lack of fulfillment, a side effect of the feminine mystique. When the mother lacks a self, Friedan notes, she often tries to live through her children, causing the children to lose their own sense of themselves as separate human beings with their own lives.\nChapter 13: Friedan discusses the psychologist Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and notes that women have been trapped at the basic, physiological level, expected to find their identity through their sexual role alone. Friedan says that women need meaningful work just as men do to achieve self-actualization, the highest level on the hierarchy of needs.\nChapter 14: In the final chapter of The Feminine Mystique, Friedan discusses several case studies of women who have begun to go against the feminine mystique. She also advocates a new life plan for her women readers, including not viewing housework as a career, not trying to find total fulfillment through marriage and motherhood alone, and finding meaningful work that uses their full mental capacity. She discusses the conflicts that some women may face in this journey to self-actualization, including their own fears and resistance from others. For each conflict, Friedan offers examples of women who have overcome it. Friedan ends her book by promoting education and meaningful work as the ultimate method by which American women can avoid becoming trapped in the feminine mystique, calling for a drastic rethinking of what it means to be feminine, and offering several educational and occupational suggestions.\n\n\n== Intended sequel ==\nFriedan originally intended to write a sequel to The Feminine Mystique, which was to be called Woman: The Fourth Dimension, but instead only wrote an article by that name, which appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal in June 1964.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nFriedan's chapter on Freud was inspired by the philosopher Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949).\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Feminine Mystique drew large numbers of white, middle-class women to the feminist cause. \nThe National Organization for Women (NOW) was organized in 1966 with 30 women from different backgrounds; Friedan was one of them, and helped draft the founding statement of NOW. The statement called for \"the true equality for all women\". NOW demanded the removal of all barriers to \"equal and economic advance\". Friedan's influence can be seen in the founding statement; a main emphasis of the book is \"women's need for identity and autonomy\", and NOW's statement says \"NOW is dedicated to the proposition that women first and foremost are human beings, who… must have the chance to develop their fullest human potential.\"\nThe Feminine Mystique is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century, and is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second-wave feminism in the United States. Futurist Alvin Toffler declared that it \"pulled the trigger on history.\" Friedan received hundreds of letters from unhappy housewives after its publication, and she herself went on to help found, and become the first president of the National Organization for Women, an influential feminist organization.\nIn addition to its contribution to feminism, The Feminine Mystique related to many other coinciding movements. \"Her work indicates for us the ways that feminism was interconnected with the struggles of working-class men and women, with black and Jewish battles against racism and anti-Semitism… As a result, The Feminine Mystique had substantial impact on a wide range of political activists, thinkers, and ordinary individuals.\"\nBy the year 2000, The Feminine Mystique had sold over 3 million copies and had been translated into many foreign languages.\nOn February 22 and 23, 2013, a symposium titled React: The Feminine Mystique at 50, co-sponsored by The New School for Public Engagement and The Parsons School of Design, was held. An accompanying exhibit titled REACT was also on display, consisting of twenty-five pieces of artwork responding to The Feminine Mystique.\nAlso in February 2013, a fiftieth-anniversary edition of The Feminine Mystique was published, with a new introduction by Gail Collins.\nAlso in 2013, to celebrate its centennial the U.S. Department of Labor created a list of over 100 Books that Shaped Work in America, which included The Feminine Mystique. The Department of Labor later chose The Feminine Mystique as one of its top ten books from that list.\nAlso in 2013, The Feminine Mystique was discussed in Makers: Women Who Make America.\nIn 2014, the Betty Friedan Hometown Tribute committee won the Superior Achievement award in the special projects category for its 50th anniversary celebration of the publication of The Feminine Mystique. They received the award from the Illinois State Historical Society.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n\n=== Disagreement ===\nImmediately after its publishing, The Feminine Mystique was the recipient of much backlash against feminism. Significant numbers of women responded angrily to the book, which they felt implied that wives and mothers could never be fulfilled.  \"Women who valued their roles as mothers and housewives interpreted Friedan's message as one that threatened their stability, devalued their labor, and disrespected their intelligence.\"  In a Letter to Editor in McCall's, one woman wrote, \"All this time I thought I was happy, and a nice person. Now I discover I've been miserable and some sort of monster in disguise—now out of disguise. How awful!\"  Another said, \"Mrs. Friedan should save her pity for those who really need it—the half starved, oppressed people in the world.\"  When women critical of the work were not expressing personal offense at Friedan's description of the housewife's plight, they were accusing her of planning to destroy American families.  Jessica Weiss quoted in her paper, \"If the mothers, (or housewives as we are called) took this advice, what would become of our children? Or better yet, the future of the world.\"\nHistorian Joanne Meyerowitz argues that many of the contemporary magazines and articles of the period did not place women solely in the home, as Friedan stated, but in fact supported the notions of full- or part-time jobs for women seeking to follow a career path rather than being a housewife. These articles did, however, still emphasize the importance of maintaining the traditional image of femininity.\n\n\n=== Author and publication process ===\nDaniel Horowitz, a Professor of American Studies at Smith College, points out that although Friedan presented herself as a typical suburban housewife, she was involved with radical politics and labor journalism in her youth, and during the time she wrote The Feminine Mystique she worked as a freelance journalist for women's magazines and as a community organizer.\nThe W. W. Norton publishing house, where Betty Friedan's work was initially circulated to be published as a book also generated some criticism. In fact an employee under the alias \"L M\" wrote in a two-page memo that Friedan's theoretical views were \"too obvious and feminine\", as well as critiquing her approach by suggesting it to be unscientific.\n\n\n=== Excluded groups of women ===\nIn addition, Friedan has been criticized for focusing solely on the plight of middle-class white women, and not giving enough attention to the differing situations encountered by women in less stable economic situations, or women of other races. According to Kirsten Fermaglich and Lisa Fine, \"women of color—African American, Latina, Asian American and Native American women—were completely absent from Friedan's vision, as were white working-class and poor women.\"  Despite being written during the Civil Rights Movement, Friedan's text \"barely mentions African-American women.\"  In her Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center, Black feminist bell hooks writes \"She did not speak of the needs of women without men, without children, without homes. She ignored the existence of all non-white women and poor white women. She did not tell readers whether it was more fulfilling to be a maid, a babysitter, a factory worker, a clerk, or a prostitute than to be a leisure-class housewife.  She made her plight and the plight of white women like herself synonymous with a condition affecting all American women. In so doing, she deflected attention away from her classism, her racism, her sexist attitudes towards the masses of American women.  In the context of her book, Friedan makes clear that the women she saw as victimized by sexism were college-educated white women\".\nFriedan has also been criticized for prejudice against homosexuality. In part, this criticism stems from her adherence to the paradigmatic belief at the time that \"bad mothers\" caused deviance from heteronormative and cisnormative society.\nDespite these criticisms, her \"language aimed at white American middle-class women won large numbers of supporters to the feminist cause,\" implying perhaps that Friedan's decision to exclude other groups was deliberate in mobilizing a group of women that had in some cases not thought of the improvement of their rights.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBiblical patriarchy\nCult of Domesticity\nHistory of feminism\nHome economics\nSex and the Single Girl\nFather Knows Best\nThe Female Eunuch\nThe Stepford Wives\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCoontz, Stephanie.

    "full_narrative": "The Second Sex (French: Le Deuxième Sexe) is a 1949 book by the French existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, in which the author discusses the treatment of women in the present society as well as throughout all of history. Beauvoir researched and wrote the book in about 14 months between 1946 and 1949. She published the work in two volumes: Facts and Myths, and Lived Experience. Some chapters first appeared in the journal Les Temps modernes.\nOne of Beauvoir's best-known and controversial books (banned by the Vatican), The Second Sex is regarded as a groundbreaking work of feminist philosophy, and as the starting inspiration point of second-wave feminism.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Volume One ===\nBeauvoir asks, \"What is woman?\" She argues that man is considered the default, while woman is considered the \"Other\": \"Thus, humanity is male, and man defines woman not herself, but as relative to him.\" Beauvoir describes the relationship of ovum to sperm in various creatures (fish, insects, mammals), leading up to the human being. She describes women's subordination to the species in terms of reproduction, compares the physiology of men and women, concluding that values cannot be based on physiology and that the facts of biology must be viewed in light of the ontological, economic, social, and physiological context.\nAuthors whose views Beauvoir rejects include Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, and Friedrich Engels. Beauvoir argues that while Engels, in his The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (1884), maintained that \"the great historical defeat of the female sex\" is the result of the invention of bronze and the emergence of private property, his claims are unsupported.\nAccording to Beauvoir, two factors explain the evolution of women's condition: participation in production, and freedom from reproductive slavery. Beauvoir writes that motherhood left woman \"riveted to her body\", like an animal, and made it possible for men to dominate her and Nature. She describes man's gradual domination of women, starting with the statue of a female Great Goddess found in Susa, and eventually the opinion of ancient Greeks: \"Men succeed in the world by transcendence, but immanence is the lot of women.\" Beauvoir writes that men oppress women when they seek to perpetuate the family and keep patrimony intact. She compares women's situation in ancient Greece with Rome. In Greece, with exceptions like Sparta where there were no restraints on women's freedom, women were treated almost like slaves. In Rome, because men were still the masters, women enjoyed more rights, but, still discriminated against on the basis of their sex, had only empty freedom.\nDiscussing Christianity, Beauvoir argues that, with the exception of the German tradition, it and its clergy have served to subordinate women. She also describes prostitution and the changes in dynamics brought about by courtly love that occurred about the twelfth century. Beauvoir describes, from the early fifteenth century, \"great Italian ladies and courtesans\", and singles out the Spaniard Teresa of Ávila as successfully raising \"herself as high as a man\". Through the nineteenth century, women's legal status remained unchanged, but individuals (like Marguerite de Navarre) excelled by writing and acting. Some men helped women's status through their works. Beauvoir finds fault with the Napoleonic Code, criticizes Auguste Comte and Honoré de Balzac, and describes Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as an anti-feminist. The Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century gave women an escape from their homes, but they were paid little for their work. Beauvoir traces the growth of trade unions and participation by women. She examines the spread of birth control methods and the history of abortion. Beauvoir relates the history of women's suffrage, and writes that women like Rosa Luxemburg and Marie Curie \"brilliantly demonstrate that it is not women's inferiority that has determined their historical insignificance: It is their historical insignificance that has doomed them to inferiority\".\nBeauvoir provides a presentation about the \"everlasting disappointment\" of women, for the most part from a male heterosexual's point of view. She covers female menstruation, virginity, and female sexuality, including copulation, marriage, motherhood, and prostitution. To illustrate man's experience of the \"horror of feminine fertility\", Beauvoir quotes the British Medical Journal of 1878 in which a member of the British Medical Association writes, \"It is an indisputable fact that meat goes bad when touched by menstruating women.\" She quotes poetry by André Breton, Léopold Sédar Senghor, Michel Leiris, Paul Verlaine, Edgar Allan Poe, Paul Valéry, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and William Shakespeare, along with other novels, philosophers, and films. Beauvoir writes that sexual division is maintained in homosexuality.\nExamining the work of Henry de Montherlant, D. H. Lawrence, Paul Claudel, André Breton,\nand Stendhal, Beauvoir writes that these \"examples show that the great collective myths are reflected in each singular writer\". \"Feminine devotion is demanded as a duty by Montherlant and Lawrence; less arrogant, Claudel, Breton, and Stendhal admire it as a generous choice...\" For each of them, the ideal woman is the one who more exactly embodies the Other capable of revealing it to himself. Montherlant seeks pure animality in women; Lawrence demands that she summarizes the female gender in her femininity; Claudel calls her soul-sister; Breton trusts the woman-child; Stendhal is looking for an equal. She finds that woman is \"the privileged Other\", that Other is defined in the \"way the One chooses to posit himself\", and writes that, \"But the only earthly destiny reserved to the woman equal, child-woman, soul sister, woman-sex, and female animal is always man.\" Beauvoir writes that, \"The absence or insignificance of the female element in a body of work is symptomatic... It loses importance in a period like ours in which each individual's particular problems are of secondary import.\"\nBeauvoir writes that \"mystery\" is prominent among men's myths about women. She also writes that mystery is not confined by sex to women, but, instead, by situation, and that it pertains to any slave. She thinks it disappeared during the eighteenth century when men, however briefly, considered women to be peers. She quotes Arthur Rimbaud, who writes that, hopefully, one day, women can become fully human beings when man gives her her freedom.\n\n\n=== Volume Two ===\nPresenting a child's life beginning with birth, Beauvoir contrasts a girl's upbringing with a boy's, who at age 3 or 4 is told he is a \"little man\". A girl is taught to be a woman and her \"feminine\" destiny is imposed on her by society. She has no innate \"maternal instinct\". A girl comes to believe in and to worship a male god and to create imaginary adult lovers. The discovery of sex is a \"phenomenon as painful as weaning\" and she views it with disgust. When she discovers that men, not women, are the masters of the world this \"imperiously modifies her consciousness of herself\". Beauvoir describes puberty, the beginning of menstruation, and the way girls imagine sex with a man. She relates several ways that girls in their late teens accept their \"femininity\", which may include running away from home, fascination with the disgusting, following nature, or stealing. Beauvoir describes sexual relations with men, maintaining that the repercussions of the first of these experiences informs a woman's whole life. Beauvoir describes women's sexual relations with women. She writes that \"homosexuality is no more a deliberate perversion than a fatal curse\".\nBeauvoir writes that \"to ask two spouses bound by practical, social and moral ties to satisfy each other sexually for their whole lives is pure absurdity\". She describes the work of married women, including housecleaning, writing that it is \"holding away death but also refusing life\". She thinks, \"what makes the lot of the wife-servant ungratifying is the division of labor that dooms her wholly to the general and inessential\". Beauvoir writes that a woman finds her dignity only in accepting her vassalage which is bed \"service\" and housework \"service\". A woman is weaned away from her family and finds only \"disappointment\" on the day after her wedding. Beauvoir points out various inequalities between a wife and husband who find themselves in a threesome and finds they pass the time not in love but in \"conjugal love\". She thinks that marriage \"almost always destroys woman\". She quotes Sophia Tolstoy who wrote in her diary: \"you are stuck there forever and there you must sit\". Beauvoir thinks marriage is a perverted institution oppressing both men and women.\nIn Beauvoir's view, abortions performed legally by doctors would have little risk to the mother. She argues that the Catholic Church cannot make the claim that the souls of the unborn would not end up in heaven because of their lack of baptism because that would be contradictory to other Church teachings. She writes that the issue of abortion is not an issue of morality but of \"masculine sadism\" toward woman. Beauvoir describes pregnancy, which is viewed as both a gift and a curse to woman. In this new creation of a new life the woman loses her self, seeing herself as \"no longer anything ... [but] a passive instrument\". Beauvoir writes that, \"maternal sadomasochism creates guilt feelings for the daughter that will express themselves in sadomasochistic behavior toward her own children, without end\", and makes an appeal for socialist child rearing practices.\nBeauvoir describes a woman's clothes, her girl friends and her relationships with men. She writes that \"marriage, by frustrating women's erotic satisfaction, denies them the freedom and individuality of their feelings, drives them to adultery\". Beauvoir describes prostitutes and their relationships with pimps and with other women, as well as hetaeras. In contrast to prostitutes, hetaeras can gain recognition as an individual and if successful can aim higher and be publicly distinguished. Beauvoir writes that women's path to menopause might arouse woman's homosexual feelings (which Beauvoir thinks are latent in most women). When she agrees to grow old she becomes elderly with half of her adult life left to live. A woman might choose to live through her children (often her son) or her grandchildren but she faces \"solitude, regret, and ennui\". To pass her time she might engage in useless \"women's handiwork\", watercolors, music or reading, or she might join charitable organizations. While a few rare women are committed to a cause and have an end in mind, Beauvoir concludes that \"the highest form of freedom a woman-parasite can have is stoic defiance or skeptical irony\".\nAccording to Beauvoir, while a woman knows how to be as active, effective and silent as a man, her situation keeps her being useful, preparing food, clothes, and lodging. She worries because she does not do anything, she complains, she cries, and she may threaten suicide. She protests but doesn't escape her lot. Women demand a Good that is a living Harmony and in which she rests, just because they live. The concept of harmony is one of the keys to the female universe, it implies the perfection of immobility, the immediate justification of each element in the light of the whole, and her passive participation in the totality. In a harmonious way, women thus achieve what men seek in action, as illustrated by Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway and To the Lighthouse, and Katherine Mansfield's magnum opus. Beauvoir thinks it is pointless to try to decide whether a woman is superior or inferior, and that it is obvious that the man's situation is \"infinitely preferable\". She writes, \"for woman there is no other way out than to work for her liberation\".\nBeauvoir describes narcissistic women, who might find themselves in a mirror and in the theater, and women in and outside marriage: \"The day when it will be possible for the woman to love in her strength and not in her weakness, not to escape from herself but to find herself, not out of resignation but to affirm herself, love will become for her as for man the source of life and not a mortal danger.\" Beauvoir discusses the lives of several women, some of whom developed stigmata. Beauvoir writes that these women may develop a relation \"with an unreal: her double or god; or she creates an unreal relation with a real being...\". She also mentions women with careers who are able to escape sadism and masochism. A few women have successfully reached a state of equality, and Beauvoir, in a footnote, singles out the example of Clara and Robert Schumann. Beauvoir says that the goals of wives can be overwhelming: as a wife tries to be elegant, a good housekeeper and a good mother. Singled out are \"actresses, dancers and singers\" who may achieve independence. Among writers, Beauvoir chooses only Emily Brontë, Woolf and (\"sometimes\") Mary Webb (and she mentions Colette and Mansfield) as among those who have tried to approach nature \"in its inhuman freedom\". Beauvoir then says that women don't \"challenge the human condition\" and that in comparison to the few \"greats\", a woman comes out as \"mediocre\" and will continue at that level for quite some time. A woman could not have been Vincent van Gogh or Franz Kafka. Beauvoir thinks that perhaps, of all women, only Saint Teresa lived her life for herself. She says it is \"high time\" a woman \"be left to take her own chances\".\nIn her conclusion, Beauvoir looks forward to a future when women and men are equals, something the \"Soviet revolution promised\" but did not ever deliver. She concludes that, \"to carry off this supreme victory, men and women must, among other things and beyond their natural differentiations, unequivocally affirm their brotherhood\".\n\n\n== Reception and influence ==\nThe first French publication of The Second Sex sold around 22,000 copies in a week. It has since been translated into 40 languages. The Vatican placed the book on its List of Prohibited Books. The sex researcher Alfred Kinsey was critical of The Second Sex, holding that while it was interesting as a work of literature, it was of no value to science. In 1960, Beauvoir wrote that The Second Sex was an attempt to explain \"why a woman's situation, still, even today, prevents her from exploring the world's basic problems.\" In a 1974 interview, she remembered that \"Camus was furious; he reacted with typical Mediterranean machismo, saying I had ridiculed the French male. Professors hurled the book across the room. People sniggered at me in restaurants. The fact [that] I had spoken about female sexuality was absolutely scandalous at the time. Men kept drawing attention to the vulgarity of the book, essentially because they were furious at what the book was suggesting—equality between the sexes\". The attack on psychoanalysis in The Second Sex helped to inspire subsequent feminist arguments against psychoanalysis, including those of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963), Kate Millett's Sexual Politics (1969), and Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch (1970). Millett commented in 1989 that she did not realize the extent to which she was influenced by Beauvoir when she wrote Sexual Politics.\nPhilosopher Judith Butler sees The Second Sex as potentially providing a radical understanding of gender. They argue that Beauvoir's formulation that \"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman\" distinguishes the terms \"sex\" and \"gender\", and that the book suggests that \"gender\" is an aspect of identity which is \"gradually acquired\". This reading is contested by Toril Moi, among others. Borde and Malovany-Chevallier, in their complete English version, translated this formulation as \"One is not born, but rather becomes, woman\" because in this context (one of many different usages of \"woman\" in the book), the word is used by Beauvoir to mean woman as a construct or an idea, rather than woman as an individual or one of a group.\nBiographer Deirdre Bair, writing in her \"Introduction to the Vintage Edition\" in 1989, relates that \"one of the most sustained criticisms\" has been that Beauvoir is \"guilty of unconscious misogyny\", that she separated herself from women while writing about them. Bair writes that French writer Francis Jeanson and British poet Stevie Smith made similar criticisms: in Smith's words, \"She has written an enormous book about women and it is soon clear that she does not like them, nor does she like being a woman.\" Bair also quotes British scholar C. B. Radford's view that Beauvoir was \"guilty of painting women in her own colors\" because The Second Sex is \"primarily a middle-class document, so distorted by autobiographical influences that the individual problems of the writer herself may assume an exaggerated importance in her discussion of femininity.\nAmerican theorist David M. Halperin criticizes Beauvoir's idealizing portrayal of sexual relations between women in The Second Sex. Critic Camille Paglia praised The Second Sex, calling it \"brilliant\" and \"the supreme work of modern feminism\". Paglia writes that most modern feminists are merely \"repeating, amplifying or qualifying\" The Second Sex without realising their debt to it. In Free Women, Free Men (2017) Paglia writes that as a sixteen-year-old, she was \"stunned by de Beauvoir's imperious, authoritative tone and ambitious sweep through space and time\", which helped inspire her to write her work of literary criticism Sexual Personae (1990).\n\n\n== Censorship ==\nThe Spanish-language translation of The Second Sex (printed in Argentina) was banned in Francoist Spain in 1955. Spanish feminists smuggled in copies of the book and circulated it in secret. A full Castilian Spanish translation of The Second Sex was published in 1998.\nThe Catholic Church's Vatican-based leadership condemned The Second Sex and added the book in its list of prohibited books, known as Index Librorum Prohibitorum. The book remained banned until the policy of prohibition itself was abolished in 1966.\n\n\n== Cultural repercussions ==\nThe rise of second wave feminism in the United States spawned by Betty Friedan's book, The Feminine Mystique, which was inspired by Simone de Beauvoir's, The Second Sex, took significantly longer to reach and impact the lives of European women. Even though The Second Sex was published in 1949 and Feminine Mystique was published in 1963, the French were concerned that expanding equality to include matters of the family was detrimental to French morals. In 1966, abortion in Europe was still illegal and contraception was extremely difficult to access. Many were afraid that legalization would \"take from men 'the proud consciousness of their virility' and make women 'no more than objects of sterile voluptuousness'\". The French Parliament in 1967 decided to legalize contraception but only under strict qualifications.\nSocial feminists then went further to claim that women \"were fundamentally different from men in psychology and in physiology...\" and stressed gender differences rather than simply equality, demanding that women have the right of choice to stay home and raise a family, if they so desired, by issue of a financial allowance, advocated by the Catholic church, or to go into the workforce and have assistance with childcare through government mandated programs, such as nationally funded daycare facilities and parental leave.  The historical context of the times was a belief that \"a society cut to the measure of men ill served women and harmed the overall interests of society\". As a result of this push for public programs, European women became more involved in politics and by the 1990s held six to seven times more legislative seats than the United States, enabling them to influence the process in support of programs for women and children.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nMany commentators have pointed out that the 1953 English translation of The Second Sex by H. M. Parshley, frequently reissued, is poor. A reviewer from The New York Times described the zoologist hired to do the translation as having \"a college undergraduate's knowledge of French.\"  The delicate vocabulary of philosophical concepts is frequently mistranslated, and great swaths of the text have been excised.  The English publication rights to the book are owned by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc and although the publishers had been made aware of the problems with the English text, they long stated that there was really no need for a new translation, even though Beauvoir herself explicitly requested one in a 1985 interview: \"I would like very much for another translation of The Second Sex to be done, one that is much more faithful; more complete and more faithful.\"\nThe publishers gave in to those requests, and commissioned a new translation to Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier. The result, published in November 2009, has met with generally positive reviews from literary critics, who credit Borde and Malovany-Chevallier with having diligently restored the sections of the text missing from the Parshley edition, as well as correcting many of its mistakes.\nOther reviewers, however, including Toril Moi, one of the most vociferous critics of the original 1953 translation, are critical of the new edition, voicing concerns with its style, syntax and philosophical and syntactic integrity.\nThe New York Times reviewer cites some confused English in the new edition where Parshley's version was smoother, saying, \"Should we rejoice that this first unabridged edition of 'The Second Sex' appears in a new translation? I, for one, do not.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nFeminist existentialism\nLe Monde's 100 Books of the Century\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCusk, Rachel (December 11, 2009). \"Shakespeare's daughters\".

The book's common full English title is Man's Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy, although this subtitle is often not printed on the cover of modern editions.\n\n\n== Experiences in a concentration camp ==\nFrankl identifies three psychological reactions experienced by all inmates to one degree or another:\n\nShock during the initial admission phase to the camp,\nApathy after becoming accustomed to camp existence, in which the inmate values only that which helps himself and his friends survive, and\nReactions of depersonalization, moral deformity, bitterness, and disillusionment if he survives and is liberated.\nFrankl concludes that the meaning of life is found in every moment of living; life never ceases to have meaning, even in suffering and death. In a group therapy session during a mass fast inflicted on the camp's inmates trying to protect an anonymous fellow inmate from fatal retribution by authorities, Frankl offered the thought that for everyone in a dire condition there is someone looking down, a friend, family member, or even God, who would expect not to be disappointed. Frankl concludes from his experience that a prisoner's psychological reactions are not solely the result of the conditions of his life, but also from the freedom of choice he always has even in severe suffering. The inner hold a prisoner has on his spiritual self relies on having a hope in the future, and that once a prisoner loses that hope, he is doomed.\nFrankl also concludes that there are only two races of men, decent men and indecent. No society is free of either of them, and thus there were decent Nazi guards and indecent prisoners, most notably the kapo who would torture and abuse their fellow prisoners for personal gain.\nHis concluding passage in Part One describes the psychological reaction of the inmates to their liberation, which he separates into three stages. The first is depersonalization—a period of readjustment in which a prisoner gradually returns to the world. Initially, the liberated prisoners are so numb that they are unable to understand what freedom means or to emotionally respond to it. Part of them believes that it is an illusion or a dream that will be taken away from them. In their first foray outside their former prison, the prisoners realized that they could not comprehend pleasure. Flowers and the reality of the freedom they had dreamed about for years were all surreal, unable to be grasped in their depersonalization.\nThe body is the first element to break out of this stage, responding by big appetites of eating and wanting more sleeping. Only after the partial replenishing of the body is the mind finally able to respond, as \"feeling suddenly broke through the strange fetters which had restrained it\" (p. 111).\nThis begins the second stage, in which there is a danger of deformation. As the intense pressure on the mind is released, mental health can be endangered. Frankl uses the analogy of a diver suddenly released from his pressure chamber. He recounts the story of a friend who became immediately obsessed with dispensing the same violence in judgment of his abusers that they had inflicted on him.\nUpon returning home, the prisoners had to struggle with two fundamental experiences that could damage their mental health: bitterness and disillusionment. The last stage is bitterness at the lack of responsiveness of the world outside—a \"superficiality and lack of feeling... so disgusting that one finally felt like creeping into a hole and neither hearing nor seeing human beings any more\" (p. 113). Worse was disillusionment, the discovery that suffering does not end, that the longed-for happiness will not come. This was the experience of those who—like Frankl—returned home to discover that no one awaited them. The hope that had sustained them throughout their time in the concentration camp was now gone. Frankl cites this experience as the most difficult to overcome.\nAs time passed, however, the prisoner's experience in a concentration camp became nothing but a remembered nightmare. What is more, he comes to believe that he has nothing left to fear \"except his God\" (p. 115).\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a 1991 survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club, Man's Search for Meaning was named one of the 10 most influential books in the US. At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, the book had sold over 10 million copies and had been translated into 24 languages. As of 2022 the book has sold 16 million copies and been printed in 52 languages.\nGordon Allport, who wrote a preface to the book, described it as a \"gem of dramatic narrative\" which \"provides a compelling introduction to the most significant psychological movement of our day\". Sarah Bakewell describes it as \"an incredibly powerful and moving example of what existentialist thought can actually be for in real life\" while Mary Fulbrook praises \"the way [Frankl] explores the importance of meaning in life as the key to survival.\"\nHowever, aspects of the book have garnered criticism.  One of Frankl's main ideas in the book is that a positive attitude made one better equipped for surviving the camps. Richard Middleton-Kaplan has said that this implies, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that those who died had given up and that this paved the way for the idea of the Jews going like sheep to the slaughter. Holocaust analyst Lawrence L. Langer criticises Frankl's promotion of logotherapy and says the book has a  problematic subtext. He also accuses Frankl of having a tone of self-aggrandizement and a general inhumane sense of studying-detachment towards victims of the Holocaust.\nIn his book Faith in Freedom, psychiatrist Thomas Szasz states that Frankl's survivor testimony was written to misdirect, and betrays instead an intent of a transparent effort to conceal Frankl's actions and his collaboration with the Nazis, and that, in the assessment of Raul Hilberg, the founder of Holocaust Studies, Frankl's historical account contains distortions akin to Binjamin Wilkomirski's memoirs, which were translated into nine languages before being exposed as deeply problematic (and according to the most radical interpretation false) in Hilberg's 1996 Politics of Memory.  Szasz's criticism of Frankl is not universally embraced.  Similarly, Hilberg's allegations have been rebutted by several reviewers. Comparison between Frankl's memoirs and Wilkomirski's memoirs leveled by Szasz, however, could legitimately be dismissed altogether as an inapt and misleading analogy insofar as questions arose (and remained) as to whether or not Wilkomirski had ever been an inmate at a concentration camp, whereas this was never a question in Frankl's case: there is no doubt that he is a survivor.\nBriefly: Conflicting views about the nature of memory under extreme conditions, as well as the sort of instinctual opportunism (for the sake of survival) or positive thinking mentality that often (one might even say 'usually' or 'almost always') correlated with long-term survival in the Nazi death camps, makes the memoir an important document of witness during the holocaust but also highlight the way in which it displays the cognitive and psychological limits of representing a situation like the Nazi extermination from an 'impartial' first person perspective.\n\nBased on a suggestion in Man's Search for Meaning, a proposed Statue of Responsibility has been designed by Utah sculptor Gary Lee Price and endorsed for construction by the Utah governor. In the book, Frankl makes the following statement about the sculpture:Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.\n\n\n== See also ==\nExistential anxiety\nJonathan Livingston Seagull\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs\nStatue of Responsibility – proposed in the book to complement the Statue of Liberty\nLife Is Beautiful (1997), a film on how a positive attitude can be maintained in the worst of circumstances, including a concentration camp\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nViktor Frankl: Why believe in others TED talk\nCommentary on Man's Search For Meaning by personal development scholar Tom Butler-Bowdon  (50 Self-Help Classics, 2003.

The book was briefly on The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller and won the American Psychological Association's 2008 William James Book Award.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe first chapter is on the book's title theme of Lucifer and on the nature of moral transformation as an outcome of the interplay between individual disposition, situation, and systems of power. The largest portion of the book, Chapters 2 through 9, is primarily a day-by-day account of the events which transpired during the Stanford experiment, largely written in literary present tense with dialogue taken from original experiment transcripts, and includes several photographs taken at the time. Chapter 10 presents the data gathered in the SPE, and Chapter 11 is an examination of the ethical questions raised about the experiment. The remainder of the book covers a number of topics within the field of social psychology, such as similar studies like the Asch conformity experiments, the Milgram experiment, Albert Bandura's research on moral disengagement, research on the bystander effect by John M. Darley and Bibb Latané, and Zimbardo's own later work on deindividuation. There is also an examination of the Stanford experiment's relevance to events such as the Attica Prison riot and the torture and abuse of prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2003, with a special focus on the story of Sergeant Ivan Frederick. Zimbardo relates his experience as an expert witness for the defense at Frederick's military trial, and describes his view of what led to an \"All-American poster soldier\" becoming involved in the torture of prisoners. The final chapter describes the concept of heroism, the key roles of Joe Darby, the whistleblower of the Abu Ghraib events, and Christina Maslach, the graduate student who convinced Zimbardo to end the Stanford experiment early, and advice on how to resist negative situations.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nRose McDermott wrote that the book \"deserves to be required reading for all those interested in the intersection of psychological processes and political reality\" and suggests that several sections would make excellent assigned readings in psychology coursework, such the chapter on heroism and Chapter 12 \"Investigating Social Dynamics\" which she called \"the single best, most insightful, and concise summary of the history of social psychology I have ever read\".  Robert V. Levine said that \"[t]his important book should be required reading not only for social scientists, but also for politicians, decision makers, educators\" and that the \"[Abu Ghraib] section alone is worth the price of the book\".  Juan Manso-Pinto (University of Concepción, Chile) in a Spanish language review wrote that \"The Lucifer Effect, more than a book, is a manual of social psychology about evil\" and that though \"written in English, its simple and colloquial language facilitates its reading\". Stuart Wheeler recommended the book, calling it \"very readable\".\nErvin Staub describes it as \"a highly personal book\" and as one which \"makes a valuable contribution\", but about the Stanford Prison Experiment itself, calls it a case study rather than an experiment.  Joachim I. Krueger (Brown University) wrote that the book is \"magnificent and timely\", but offers a critical examination of the Stanford Prison Experiment, saying that if \"judged against conventional standards, the SPE does not qualify as an experiment\" and, bringing the interpretation back to one of disposition, said \"[s]ituations do not 'overpower' people but rather reveal latent possibilities\".\nTheologian Richard Holloway wrote that Zimbardo's day-by-day account of the experiment was \"too bloated and detailed ... his 250-page diary unbalances the book\" and that \"the book is better when it tries to apply the lesson of the experiment to other contexts\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Lucifer Effect was 11th on The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller list for the week ending April 7, 2007.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nPhilip Zimbardo presented his work in The Lucifer Effect at TED2008.\nThe 2015 film The Stanford Prison Experiment drew on the dialogue presented in The Lucifer Effect, which was based on transcripts from the original experiment.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSunstein, Cass R.

In Cold Blood is regarded by critics as a pioneering work in the true-crime genre, although Capote was disappointed that the book failed to win the Pulitzer Prize. Parts of the book differ from the real events, including important details.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nHerbert \"Herb\" Clutter was a prosperous farmer in western Kansas. He employed as many as 18 farmhands, who admired and respected him for his fair treatment and good wages. His two elder daughters, Eveanna and Beverly, had moved out and started their adult lives; his two younger children, daughter Nancy, 16, and son Kenyon, 15, were in high school. Clutter's wife Bonnie had reportedly been incapacitated by clinical depression and physical ailments since the births of her children, although this was later disputed by her brother and other family members, who maintained that Bonnie's depression was not as debilitating as portrayed in the book.\nTwo ex-convicts recently paroled from the Kansas State Penitentiary, Richard Eugene \"Dick\" Hickock and Perry Edward Smith, robbed and murdered Herb, Bonnie, Nancy, and Kenyon in the early morning hours of November 15, 1959. A former cellmate of Hickock's, Floyd Wells, had worked for Herb Clutter and told Hickock that Clutter kept large amounts of cash in a safe. Hickock soon hatched the idea to steal the safe and start a new life in Mexico. According to Capote, Hickock described his plan as \"a cinch, the perfect score.\" Hickock later contacted Smith, another former cellmate, about committing the robbery with him. In fact, Herb Clutter had no safe and transacted essentially all of his business by check.\nAfter driving more than 400 miles (640 km) across the state of Kansas on the evening of November 14, Hickock and Smith arrived in Holcomb, located the Clutter home, and entered through an unlocked door while the family slept. Upon rousing the Clutters and discovering there was no safe, they bound and gagged the family, and continued to search for money, but found little of value in the house. Still determined to leave no witnesses, the pair briefly debated what to do; Smith, notoriously unstable and prone to violent acts in fits of rage, slit Herb Clutter's throat and then shot him in the head. Capote writes that Smith recounted later, \"I didn't want to harm the man. I thought he was a very nice gentleman. Soft-spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat.\" Kenyon, Nancy, and then Mrs. Clutter were also murdered, each by a single shotgun blast to the head. Hickock and Smith left the crime scene with a small portable radio, a pair of binoculars, and less than $50 (equivalent to $539 in 2024) in cash.\nSmith later claimed in his oral confession that Hickock murdered the two women. When asked to sign his confession, however, Smith refused. According to Capote, he wanted to accept responsibility for all four killings because, he said, he was \"sorry for Dick's mother.\" Smith added, \"She's a real sweet person.\" Hickock always maintained that Smith committed all four killings.\n\n\n== Investigation and trial ==\nOn the basis of a tip from Wells, who contacted the prison warden after hearing of the murders, Hickock and Smith were identified as suspects and arrested in Las Vegas on December 30, 1959. Both men eventually confessed after interrogations by detectives of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.\nThey were brought back to Kansas, where they were tried together at the Finney County courthouse in Garden City, Kansas, from March 22 to 29, 1960. They both pleaded temporary insanity at the trial, but local general practitioners evaluated the accused and pronounced them sane.\nHickock and Smith are also suspected of involvement in the Walker family murders, which is mentioned in the book, although this connection has not been proven. A defense motion that Smith and Hickock undergo comprehensive psychological testing was denied; instead, three local general practitioners were appointed to examine them to determine whether they were sane at the time of the crime.\nAfter only a short interview the doctors determined the defendants were not insane and were capable of being tried under M'Naghten rules. Defense lawyers sought the opinion of an experienced psychiatrist from the state's local mental hospital, who diagnosed definite signs of mental illness in Smith and felt that previous injuries to Hickock's head could have affected his behavior. This opinion was not admitted in the trial, however, because under Kansas law the psychiatrist could only opine on the defendant's sanity at the time of the crime.\nThe jury deliberated for only 45 minutes before finding both Hickock and Smith guilty of murder. Their convictions carried a mandatory death sentence at the time. On appeal, Smith and Hickock contested the determinations that they were sane, and asserted that media coverage of the crime and trial had biased the jury, and that they had received inadequate assistance from their attorneys. Aspects of these appeals were submitted three times to the United States Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case.\nAfter five years on death row at the Kansas State Penitentiary, Smith and Hickock were executed by hanging on April 14, 1965. Hickock was executed first and was pronounced dead at 12:41 a.m. after hanging for nearly 20 minutes. Smith followed shortly afterward and was pronounced dead at 1:19 a.m.\n\n\n== Coverage and public discussion ==\nDuring the first few months of their trial and afterward, Hickock and Smith's murder case went unnoticed by most Americans. It was not until months before their executions that they became \"two of the most famous murderers in history.\" On 18 January 1960, Time magazine published \"Kansas: The Killers\", a story about the murders. Inspired by that article, Truman Capote wrote, in 1965 serialized in The New Yorker, and in 1966 published, as a \"non-fiction novel\", In Cold Blood, a true-crime book that detailed the murders and trial. Due to the brutality and severity of the crimes, the trial was covered nationwide, and even received some coverage internationally.\nThe notoriety of the murders and subsequent trial brought lasting effects to the small Kansas town, and Capote became so famous and related to trials that he was called to help the Senate in an examination of the court case. The trial also brought into the national spotlight a discussion about the death penalty and mental illness. Capote expressed that after completing the book and interviewing Hickock and Smith, he opposed the death penalty.\nThis trial has also been cited as an example of \"the limitations of the M'Naghten rules (also called M'Naghten test).\" The M'Naghten rules are used to determine whether or not a criminal was insane at the time of their crime and therefore incapable of being tried fairly. Authors such as Karl Menninger strongly criticized the M'Naghten test, calling it absurd. Many \"lawyers, judges, and psychiatrists\" have sought to \"get around\" the M'Naghten rules. In Intention – Law and Society, James Marshall further criticizes the M'Naghten rules, calling into question the psychological principles upon which the rules are based. He stated that \"the M'Naghten rules ... are founded on an erroneous hypothesis that behavior is based exclusively on intellectual activity and capacity.\"\nA 1966 article in The New York Times stated that \"neighborliness evaporated\" in the Holcomb community. \"The natural order seemed suspended. Chaos poised to rush in.\" In 2009, 50 years after the Clutter murders, the Huffington Post asked Kansas citizens about the effects of the trial, and their opinions of the book and subsequent movie and television series about the events. Many respondents said they had begun to lose their trust in others, \"doors were locked. Strangers eyed with suspicion.\" Many still felt greatly affected and believed Capote had in a way taken advantage of their \"great tragedy\".\n\n\n== Capote's research ==\nCapote became interested in the murders after reading about them in The New York Times.\nHe brought his childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (who would later win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel To Kill a Mockingbird) to help gain the confidence of the locals in Kansas.\nCapote did copious research for the book, ultimately compiling 8,000 pages of notes. His research also included letters from Smith's Army buddy, Don Cullivan, who was present during the trial.\nAfter the criminals were found, tried, and convicted, Capote conducted personal interviews with both Smith and Hickock. Smith especially fascinated Capote; in the book he is portrayed as the more sensitive of the two killers. The book was not completed until after Smith and Hickock were executed.\nAn alternative explanation for Capote's interest holds that The New Yorker presented the Clutter story to him as one of two choices for a story; the other was to follow a Manhattan cleaning woman on her rounds. Capote supposedly chose the Clutter story, believing it would be the easier assignment. Capote later wrote a piece about following a cleaning woman, which he entitled \"A Day's Work\" and included in his book Music for Chameleons.\nCapote's novel was unconventional for its time. New Journalism, as a genre and style of writing, developed during the time in which In Cold Blood was written and Capote became a pioneer in showing how it can be used effectively to create a unique non-fiction story. New Journalism is a style of writing by which the author writes the non-fiction novel or story while it is developing in real life. This is exactly what Capote did as he followed the court trials and interviewed those close to the Clutter family to create this story while it was unfolding in the real world. As a result, he simultaneously researched and wrote the story we now know as In Cold Blood.\n\n\n== Veracity ==\nIn Cold Blood brought Capote much praise from the literary community. However, some critics have questioned its veracity, arguing that Capote changed facts to suit the story, added scenes that never took place, and manufactured dialogue. Phillip K. Tompkins noted factual discrepancies in Esquire in 1966 after he traveled to Kansas and talked to some of the people whom Capote had interviewed. Josephine Meier was the wife of Finney County Undersheriff Wendle Meier, and she denied that she heard Smith cry or that she held his hand, as described by Capote. In Cold Blood indicates that Meier and Smith became close, yet she told Tompkins that she spent little time with Smith and did not talk much with him. Tompkins concluded:\n\n Capote has, in short, achieved a work of art. He has told exceedingly well a tale of high terror in his own way.  But, despite the brilliance of his self-publicizing efforts, he has made both a tactical and a moral error that will hurt him in the short run. By insisting that \"every word\" of his book is true he has made himself vulnerable to those readers who are prepared to examine seriously such a sweeping claim.\nTrue-crime writer Jack Olsen also commented on the fabrications:\n\n I recognized it as a work of art, but I know fakery when I see it ... Capote completely fabricated quotes and whole scenes ... The book made something like $6 million in 1960s money, and nobody wanted to discuss anything wrong with a moneymaker like that in the publishing business.\nHis criticisms were quoted in Esquire, to which Capote replied, \"Jack Olsen is just jealous.\"\n\n That was true, of course ... I was jealous—all that money? I'd been assigned the Clutter case by Harper & Row until we found out that Capote and his cousin  [sic] Harper Lee had been already on the case in Dodge City for six months ... That book did two things. It made true crime an interesting, successful, commercial genre, but it also began the process of tearing it down. I blew the whistle in my own weak way. I'd only published a couple of books at that time—but since it was such a superbly written book, nobody wanted to hear about it.\nThe prosecutor involved in the case, Duane West, claimed that the story lacked veracity because Capote failed to get the true hero right. Richard Rohlader took the photo showing that two culprits were involved, and West suggested that Rohlader was the one deserving the greatest praise. Without that picture, West believed, the crime might not have been solved. West had been a friend of Capote's while he was writing the book, and had been invited by him to New York City to see Hello, Dolly!, where he met Carol Channing after the show. Their relationship soured when Capote's publisher attempted to get West to sign a non-compete agreement to prevent him from writing his own book about the murders. Despite a series of malicious rumors, Capote himself was never considered a suspect in the killings.\nAlvin Dewey was the lead investigator portrayed in In Cold Blood, and stated that the scene in which he visits the Clutters' graves was Capote's invention. Other Kansas residents whom Capote interviewed later claimed that they or their relatives were mischaracterized or misquoted. Dewey said that the rest of the book was factually accurate, but further evidence indicates that it is not as \"immaculately factual\" as Capote had always claimed it to be. The book depicts Dewey as being the brilliant investigator who cracks the Clutter murder case, but files recovered from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation show that Floyd Wells came forward of his own volition to name Hickock and Smith as likely suspects; furthermore, Dewey did not immediately act on the information, as the book portrays him doing, because he still believed that the murders were committed by locals who \"had a grudge against Herb Clutter\".\nRonald Nye, the son of former Kansas Bureau of Investigation Director Harold R. Nye, collaborated with author Gary McAvoy in disclosing parts of his father's personal investigative notebooks which challenged the veracity of In Cold Blood. Their book, And Every Word is True, lays out previously unknown facts of the investigation, and suggests that Herbert Clutter's death may have been a murder-for-hire plot which involved a potential third suspect. However, McAvoy concedes that \"neither Hickock nor Smith mention any of this in their confessions, or in their defense at trial\".\n\n\n== Publication ==\nIn Cold Blood was first published as a four-part serial in The New Yorker, beginning with the September 25, 1965, issue. The piece was an immediate sensation, particularly in Kansas, where the usual number of New Yorker copies sold out immediately. In Cold Blood was first published in book form by Random House on January 17, 1966. \nThe cover, which was designed by S. Neil Fujita, shows a hatpin with what appeared originally as a red drop of blood at its top end. After Capote first saw the design, he requested that the drop be made a deeper shade of red to represent the passage of time since the incident. A black border was added to the ominous image.\n\n\n== Reviews and impact ==\nWriting for The New York Times, Conrad Knickerbocker praised Capote's talent for detail throughout the novel and declared the book a \"masterpiece\"; an \"agonizing, terrible, possessed, proof that the times, so surfeited with disasters, are still capable of tragedy.\"\nIn a controversial review of the novel, published in 1966 for The New Republic, Stanley Kauffmann, criticising Capote's writing style throughout the novel, states that Capote \"demonstrates on almost every page that he is the most outrageously overrated stylist of our time\" and later asserts that \"the depth in this book is no deeper than its mine-shaft of factual detail; its height is rarely higher than that of good journalism and often falls below it.\"\nTom Wolfe wrote in his essay \"Pornoviolence\": \"The book is neither a who-done-it nor a will-they-be-caught, since the answers to both questions are known from the outset ... Instead, the book's suspense is based largely on a totally new idea in detective stories: the promise of gory details, and the withholding of them until the end.\"\nIn The Independent's Book of a Lifetime series, reviewer Kate Colquhoun asserts that \"the book – for which he made a reputed 8000 pages of research notes – is plotted and structured with taut writerly flair. Its characters pulse with recognisable life; its places are palpable. Careful prose binds the reader to his unfolding story. Put simply, the book was conceived of journalism and born of a novelist.\"\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThree film adaptations have been produced based upon the book. The first focuses on the details of the book, whereas the later two explore Capote's fascination with researching the novel. In Cold Blood (1967) was directed by Richard Brooks and stars Robert Blake as Perry Smith and Scott Wilson as Richard Hickock. It features John Forsythe as investigator Alvin Dewey from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation who apprehended the killers. It was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\nThe second and third films focus on Capote's experiences in writing the story and his subsequent fascination with the murders. Capote (2005) stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Truman Capote, Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith, and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee. The film was critically acclaimed, won at the 78th Academy Awards for Best Actor (Hoffman), and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Keener), Best Director (Bennett Miller), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Dan Futterman). A year later, Infamous by Douglas McGrath was released. The film covered the same events as Capote, including Capote and Lee researching and writing “In Cold Blood”. Toby Jones played Capote, Sandra Bullock played Harper Lee, Daniel Craig played Perry Smith and Sigourney Weaver appeared as Babe Paley.\nJ. T. Hunter's novel In Colder Blood (2016) discusses Hickock and Smith's possible involvement in the Walker family murders. Oni Press published Ande Parks and Chris Samnee's graphic novel Capote in Kansas (2005). Capote's book was adapted by Benedict Fitzgerald into the two-part television miniseries In Cold Blood (1996), starring Anthony Edwards as Dick Hickock, Eric Roberts as Perry Smith, and Sam Neill as Alvin Dewey.\nIn 1995 the US composer Mikel Rouse released Failing Kansas, a one-person opera using live vocals and video that retells the story using transcripts and testimony from the original case as well as fragments of verse and songs by Robert W. Service, Thomas Gray and Perry Edward Smith.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeorge York and James Latham\nLowell Lee Andrews\nCapital punishment in Kansas\nNew Journalism\nTrial movies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== General references ===\nClarke, Gerald (1988).

Set in Chicago during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, it tells the story of World’s Fair architect Daniel Burnham and of H. H. Holmes, a criminal figure widely considered the first serial killer in the United States. Leonardo DiCaprio purchased the film rights in 2010. The concept has since been in development hell.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Devil in the White City is in four parts, the first three happening in Chicago between 1890 and 1893, while part four of the book takes place in Philadelphia circa 1895.  The book interweaves the true tales of Daniel Burnham, the architect behind the 1893 World's Fair, and H. H. Holmes, a serial killer who lured his victims to their deaths in his elaborately constructed \"Murder Castle\".\nBurnham ran into many challenges when it came to the World's Fair including a fire, difficulty engineering the buildings to be safe, and a lack of funds for the fair.  H. H. Holmes was responsible for multiple murders. His \"dungeon\" was equipped with secret rooms, torture chambers, and he had access to a big furnace to cremate the bodies of his victims.  Holmes was known as a charming man who had the ability to seduce his victims.  In the book he mainly targets women.\nOther subplots include events such as the assassination of Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison III by Patrick Eugene Prendergast mere days before the close of the fair.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times praised the book as \"vivid\" and \"lively\", and commented on how the research done by Larson on the many \"odd and amazing\" events of the 1893 exhibition are \"given shape and energy\" by his \"dramatic inclinations\".\nDavid Traxel for The New York Times criticized Larson for having \"little sense of pacing or focus\" in the \"grab-bag\" approach he took when discussing the exhibition. Regarding the discussion of Holmes in the book, he writes that Larson's \"imaginative touches…sometimes goes farther than the sources warrant\".\nIn a review for Newsweek, Malcolm Jones wrote \"only in the notes at the back of the book does [Larson] admit that the chapters describing Holmes's murders are merely conjecture built on a handful of facts\"; even so, the story of the fair was \"too enchanting\" so even that \"grave misstep can't doom\" the book.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Ballet ===\nAnn Reinking collaborated with composer Bruce Wolosoff and Melissa Thodos of Thodos Dance Chicago to create the ballet The Devil in the White City, based on the novel; the Chicago Sun-Times named it \"Best Dance of 2011\".\n\n\n=== Television ===\nIn 2007, a television documentary inspired by the book titled Madness in the White City aired on the National Geographic Channel.\nIn 2019, Hulu began developing a series based on the book, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese signed on as executive producers. In January 2022, actor Keanu Reeves was reported to be in negotiations to star, with Todd Field set to direct the first two episodes. Production was expected to begin in March 2023 in Chicago and Toronto, with a planned 2024 release. Reeves and Field both exited the project in October 2022. In March 2023, Hulu confirmed it would not move forward with the series, though producers began shopping it to other distributors.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nLeonardo DiCaprio purchased the film rights to the book in 2010. The film version, as originally planned, would have been directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Billy Ray, and produced jointly by Paramount Pictures, Double Feature Films, and DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions. In January 2025, 20th Century Studios revived the adaptation, with Scorsese and DiCaprio still attached to direct and star, respectively.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n2003 New York Times best seller (Nonfiction)\n2003 International Horror Guild Award (Nonfiction)\n2003 San Francisco Chronicle Best Book of the Year\n2003 National Book Award (Nonfiction), finalist\n2003 CWA Gold Dagger for Non-Fiction, shortlist\n2003 Great Lakes Book Award (Nonfiction), finalist\n2004 Washington State Book Award\n2004 Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award\n2004 Edgar Award (Best Fact Crime), winner\n2004 Book Sense Book of the Year Honor Book, winner\n2009 ALA Outstanding Books for the College Bound (History & Cultures)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Random House page for the book\nPresentation by Larson on The Devil in the White City, February 18, 2003, C-SPAN\nBooknotes interview with Larson on The Devil in the White City, September 14, 2003, C-SPAN\nBook group discussion on The Devil in the White City, October 13, 2005, C-SPAN",

    "full_narrative": "I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer is a true crime book by the American writer Michelle McNamara about the investigation of the Golden State Killer. The book was released on February 27, 2018, nearly two years after McNamara's death and two months before an arrest would be made in the case.\nThe book's title is a reference to a threat spoken by the Golden State Killer during his 1976 attack upon his tenth victim, then-15-year-old Kris Pedretti, to whom he said, \"You'll be silent forever, and I'll be gone in the dark.\"\n\n\n== Development ==\nAfter becoming interested in the crimes of what was then known as the \"East Area Rapist\" (among other names) McNamara wrote a 2013 Los Angeles magazine article about the serial killer, and ultimately signed a book deal with HarperCollins to write about the case.\nMcNamara is credited with coining the moniker Golden State Killer to refer to the criminal who had previously been referred to by various other names including the East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker, Visalia Ransacker, East Bay Rapist, and Diamond Knot Killer. McNamara's coining of the Golden State Killer moniker is credited with heightening awareness of the then-unidentified serial killer who operated throughout California in the early 1970s to mid-1980s.\nMcNamara died in her sleep on April 21, 2016, at the age of 46 due to an accidental prescription drug overdose in conjunction with undiagnosed atherosclerosis. It was later disclosed she suffered with opioid addiction. Her book was about two-thirds completed at her death. The book was completed after McNamara's death by crime writer Paul Holes, investigative journalist Bill Jensen, and McNamara's widower, comedian Patton Oswalt. Jensen later explained that, while McNamara had completed numerous chapters for the book, they were not in any particular order in her computer files; consequently, he, Holes, and Oswalt mainly focused on sequencing her material and filling in gaps from her voluminous notes and copies of police documents.\nThe book's title recalls a threat that the killer, Joseph James DeAngelo made during his December 18, 1976 attack upon his tenth victim, then-15-year-old Kris Pedretti, whom he raped three times in her home over more than two hours as her parents attended a Christmas party. As Pedretti played the family's piano, DeAngelo, wearing a ski mask, put a knife to her throat and said to her, \"Do what I say or I'll kill you and be gone in the dark\".\nThe book –  McNamara's debut – was released on February 27, 2018, and reached the top of The New York Times Best Seller list for non-fiction. The book remained on the list for 15 weeks.\nI'll Be Gone in the Dark contains an introduction by the American writer Gillian Flynn and an afterword by Oswalt.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nOn April 25, 2018, the Sacramento Sheriff announced the April 24 arrest of a suspect in the Golden State Killer case: 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo (born November 8, 1945). DeAngelo, a former police officer in Auburn and Exeter, California, was arrested and charged with six counts of first-degree murder. Authorities in Sacramento, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties prepared charges against DeAngelo for all 12 of the murders in the Golden State Killer case. The sheriff credited McNamara's dedication to the Golden State Killer case for raising publicity, but added that her work did not directly generate any critical tips or information that led to DeAngelo's arrest.\nThe book and McNamara's work on the case are frequently discussed in the true crime podcast My Favorite Murder, which boasts a large fan base of true crime aficionados. The debut episode of the show, \"Episode 1: My Firstest Murder,\" featured the case as well as a discussion of McNamara's work. Prior to the arrest, \"Episode 115: I'll Be Gone in the Dark at Skylight Books\" featured Oswalt and Jensen discussing the book and their roles in finishing the project following McNamara's death. In that episode Oswalt discussed McNamara's writing process, including making \"era-appropriate playlists to help her get into a proper mindset\". Oswalt described the finishing of the book as a bittersweet experience: \"It's another part of her that's kind of gone. In a very sick way, not having the book done—and us working on it—meant she was still here.\"\nJensen appeared on the My Favorite Murder episode \"Golden State Serial Killer Caught\", on April 26, 2018, immediately after the arrest was made, and discussed the case and his work on the book following McNamara's death. The episode \"Surprise! It's Paul Holes\" also featured Jensen and Holes discussing the case and the impact of McNamara's work.\n\n\n== Adaptation ==\n\nIn April 2018, HBO announced they had purchased the rights for I'll Be Gone in the Dark and were developing it into a documentary series. Filming for the series began April 24, 2018, directed in part by Academy Award-nominee and Emmy-winner Liz Garbus. The documentary premiered June 28, 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2018 in literature\n\n\n== References ==",

    "full_narrative": "Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI is a 2017 nonfiction book by American journalist David Grann about the Osage murders. Time magazine listed it as one of its top ten nonfiction books of 2017.\nThe film adaptation Killers of the Flower Moon was directed by Martin Scorsese and released in October 2023.\n\n\n== Flower Moon origin ==\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac, which first began publishing the names for the full moons in the 1930s, recorded the name given by American tribes to the full moon in May as the \"Flower Moon\" because of the flowers blooming across North America, signaling abundance and the coming of spring after a cold, hard winter. The title was originated in the poem \"Wi'-gi-e\" by Osage poet Elise Paschen, which was written from the perspective of Mollie Kyle. Grann eventually contacted Paschen, and she sent him the poem, an excerpt from which was published in the book.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book investigates a series of murders of wealthy Osage people that took place in Osage County, Oklahoma, in the early 1920s after extensive oil deposits were discovered beneath their land. After the Osage are awarded headrights in court to the profits from oil deposits found on their land, the Osage people prepare to receive the wealth to which they are legally entitled from sales of their oil deposits.\nThe Osage are viewed as the \"middle man\" and a complex plot is hatched to eliminate the Osage inheritors one by one, by any means possible. Officially, the count of the wealthy Osage victims reaches at least 20, but Grann suspects that perhaps hundreds more may have been killed because of their ties to oil. The book details the newly formed FBI's investigation of the murders, and the eventual trial and conviction of cattleman William King Hale as the mastermind behind the plot.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting for The New York Times, Dave Eggers called the book \"riveting\" and wrote, \"in these last pages, Grann takes what was already a fascinating and disciplined recording of a forgotten chapter in American history, and with the help of contemporary Osage tribe members, he illuminates a sickening conspiracy that goes far deeper than those four years of horror. It will sear your soul.\" Dwight Garner, also for the New York Times, stated the work \"is close to impeccable\".\nSean Woods of Rolling Stone praised Grann's book, noting, \"In his masterful new book... Grann chronicles a tale of murder, betrayal, heroism and a nation's struggle to leave its frontier culture behind and enter the modern world... Filled with almost mythic characters from our past – stoic Texas Rangers, corrupt robber barons, private detectives, and murderous desperadoes like the Al Spencer gang – Grann's story amounts to a secret history of the American frontier.\"\nA reviewer of Publishers Weekly stated, \"New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Lost City of Z) burnishes his reputation as a brilliant storyteller in this gripping true-crime narrative, which revisits a baffling and frightening—and relatively unknown—spree of murders occurring mostly in Oklahoma during the 1920s.\"\nDavid Aaronovitch in The Times wrote, \"There is a kick-in-the guts half-twist at the end of the book that gives the work its moral heft and reminds the American people of the great cost of their nationhood. It's a twist that owes everything to Grann's diligence and intelligence as a journalist. It could not have been discovered without what he calls his 'research odyssey.'\"\n\n\n=== Oklahoma House Bill 1775 ===\n\nIn 2021, the Republican-controlled Oklahoma Legislature passed Oklahoma House Bill 1775, a bill regulating classroom discussion regarding race and gender. After the bill's passage, a teacher in Dewey, Oklahoma canceled her lesson plans involving the book. Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma Matt Pinnell called on the language in the bill to be \"clarified so that teachers know what can be taught and not taught\". After the release of the film, author David Grann spoke out against the bill's regulations and wrote an op-ed in The New York Times on the bill.\nHominy Public Schools has taught the book as part of its AP English courses despite HB 1775.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nThe book was adapted into a film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Lily Gladstone, John Lithgow, Brendan Fraser, and Jesse Plemons on a budget of over $200 million. It was released theatrically by Paramount Pictures in October 2023. The film is available for streaming on Apple TV+.\nThough the role of Tom White, the lead FBI agent, was written for DiCaprio, DiCaprio pushed to have his role changed to Ernest Burkhart, the nephew of Hale, who De Niro played. As a result, Plemons was cast as Tom White to replace DiCaprio.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe FBI Story\nMean Spirit\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nKillers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI on YouTube\nDiCaprio and Abrams Team Up in Killers of the Flower Moon – Collider on YouTube\nPresentation by Grann on Killers of the Flower Moon, May 9, 2017, C-SPAN",

    "full_narrative": "The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon is a nonfiction book by American author David Grann. Published in 2009, the book recounts the activities of the British explorer Percy Fawcett who, in 1925, disappeared with his son in the Amazon rainforest while looking for the ancient \"Lost City of Z\". In the book, Grann recounts his own journey into the Amazon, by which he discovered new evidence about how Fawcett may have died.\nThe Lost City of Z was the basis of a 2016 feature film of the same name.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAs observed by Kirkus Reviews, \"Fawcett's exploits in jungles and atop mountains inspired novels such as Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, and his character is the tutelary spirit of the Indiana Jones franchise. Fawcett in turn was nurtured by his associations with fabulists such as Doyle and H. Rider Haggard, whose talisman he bore into the Amazonian rainforest.\"\nFor decades explorers and scientists have tried to find evidence of Fawcett's party and of the Lost City of Z. Of those, Grann explains, \"there are no reliable statistics on the numbers who died. One recent estimate, however, put the total as high as a hundred.\" (A more historically accurate toll, according to historian John Hemming, is one.)\nGrann, a New Yorker magazine staff writer, first wrote about the story in The New Yorker in 2005. The article documents how Grann, working from Fawcett's long-lost diaries, reconstructed the explorer's last journey, including visiting members of the Kalapalo tribe in the Xingu Indigenous Park region of the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The Kalapalo had apparently preserved an oral history about Fawcett's small party of himself, his son Jack, and Jack's friend Raleigh Rimell, who were among the first Europeans the tribe had ever seen.\nThe oral account said that Fawcett and his party had stayed at their village and, despite warnings about \"fierce Indians\" who occupied that territory, had headed eastward. The Kalapalos observed smoke from Fawcett's expedition's campfire each evening for five days before it disappeared. As a result, the Kalapalos said they were sure that the fierce Indians had killed them. The article formed the basis for Grann's book.\nAs a result of Grann's own trek into the Amazon and consultations with archeologists, he also learned that Fawcett may have come upon \"Z\" without knowing it. Grann reported on excavations by the archeologist Michael Heckenberger at a site in the Amazon Xingu region that might be the long-rumored lost city. The ruins were surrounded by several concentric circular moats, with evidence of palisades that had been described in the folklore and oral history of nearby tribes. Heckenberger also found evidence of wooden structures and roads that cut through the jungle. Black Indian earth showed evidence that humans had added supplements to the soil to increase its fertility to support agriculture. \nThe settlements and civilization of these people appeared to have lasted long enough for them to have had contact with Europeans. Many died due to new infectious diseases, which may have been carried by some of their usual indigenous trading partners, rather than directly by Europeans. The high rate of fatality of these epidemics disrupted the people and their society: in only a few years, they were so devastated by disease that they had virtually died out. \nThe earliest conquistadors left records of their glimpses of this civilization, but by the time they tried to explore the rainforest again, the indigenous people were all but gone. The jungle was quickly reclaiming the land.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Lost City of Z was reviewed by Rich Cohen in the Sunday New York Times Book Review, who said it was \"a powerful narrative, stiff-lipped and Victorian at the center, trippy at the edges, as if one of those stern men of Conrad had found himself trapped in a novel by García Márquez.\" The Washington Post described it as \"a thrill ride from start to finish.\"\nCritic Michiko Kakutani ranked it as one of the ten best books of 2009. In her review, Kakutani wrote that it:\n\nis at once a biography, a detective story and a wonderfully vivid piece of travel writing that combines Bruce Chatwinesque powers of observation with a Waugh-like sense of the absurd. Mr. Grann treats us to a harrowing reconstruction of Fawcett’s forays into the Amazonian jungle, as well as an evocative rendering of the vanished age of exploration. . . . Suspenseful. . . Rollicking . . . Fascinating . . . It reads with all the pace and excitement of a movie thriller and all the verisimilitude and detail of firsthand reportage.\nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, Simon Winchester said the book was \"captivating\" but faulted Grann for not having more doubts about the ruins of “Z” being an ancient city.After the movie adaptation, John Hemming dismissed much of the movie’s source material -- and Fawcett’s importance -- as hyperbolic in a piece for The Times Literary Supplement, concluding that Fawcett was an \"unimportant, disagreeable and ultimately pathetic man.\"\nThe book appeared on several \"best\" and \"notable books of the year\" lists, including that of Entertainment Weekly, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, Publishers Weekly, Sunday New York Times, The Christian Science Monitor, Bloomberg, the Providence Journal, The Globe and Mail, Evening Standard, Amazon, and McClatchy Newspapers. Barnes & Noble ranked The Lost City of Z as the single best nonfiction book of 2009.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nNew York Times bestseller (Nonfiction, 2009)\nSamuel Johnson Prize, shortlist (2009)\nAmazon's Best Books of the Year (#58, 2009)\nPublishers Weekly’s Top 10 Best Books: 2009\nPublishers Weekly's Best Books: 2009\nNew York Times Notable Book of the Year (Nonfiction, 2009)\nALA Notable Books for Adults (2010)\nIndies Choice Book Award (Adult Non-fiction, 2010)\nGlobe and Mail Best Book (Travel 2009)\nThe Essential Man's Library: 50 Non-Fiction Adventure Books\nChristian Science Monitor Best Book (Nonfiction, 2009)\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nThe Lost City of Z was optioned by Brad Pitt’s Plan B production company and Paramount Pictures in 2010. The adaptation, directed by James Gray, who also wrote the screenplay, premiered on October 15, 2016, at the 54th New York Film Festival. The film stars Charlie Hunnam as Percy Fawcett, Sienna Miller as Fawcett's wife, Tom Holland as Jack Fawcett and Robert Pattinson as Henry Costin.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nGrann, David (2009).

He recounts the challenges he faced chasing the stories of Harvey Weinstein's decades of rape, sexual assault, and sexual abuse of women and the case against him. Farrow argues that Weinstein was able to use Black Cube, a private Israeli intelligence service, to successfully pressure executives at NBC News to kill the story there, leading him to take it to The New Yorker, where it was published and helped spark the international #MeToo movement exposing sexual abuse, mostly of women, in many industries.\nThe title refers to the practice of catch and kill, in which disreputable media companies purchase stories so that they can bury them. The book is published by Little, Brown and Company, and, according to Farrow, \"was exhaustively vetted by Sean Lavery, a senior fact checker at The New Yorker\".\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Catch and kill media practice ===\nCatch and kill is a covert technique—usually employed by tabloid newspapers—to prevent an individual from publicly revealing damaging information to a third party. Using a legally enforceable non-disclosure agreement, the tabloid purports to buy exclusive rights to \"catch\" the damaging story from the individual, but then \"kills\" the story for the benefit of the third party by preventing it from ever being published. The individual with the information frequently does not realize that the tabloid intends to suppress the individual's story instead of publishing it. The practice is distinct from using hush money, in which the individual is bribed by the third party to intentionally conceal the damaging information. The National Enquirer and its parent company American Media Inc. (AMI) have attracted attention for using the practice.\n\n\n=== Farrow's journalism ===\nFarrow has a varied background, including work for the United States Department of State, but turned to journalism in the mid-2010s. He hosted Ronan Farrow Daily, a television news program on MSNBC, then the investigative segment \"Undercover with Ronan Farrow\" on NBC's Today.\n\n\n==== Abuse allegations against Bill Cosby and Woody Allen ====\nIn May 2016, The Hollywood Reporter published a guest column by Farrow in which he drew comparisons between the long-term absence of journalistic inquiry into the rape allegations leveled against Bill Cosby and the sexual abuse allegations levied against his father Woody Allen by Farrow's sister, Dylan Farrow, who was seven at the time of the alleged abuse. Farrow detailed first-hand accounts of journalists, biographers, and major publications purposefully omitting from their work decades of rape allegations targeting Cosby. Similarly, Farrow recounts the efforts of Allen's publicist, Leslee Dart—co-CEO and co-founder of a public-relations firm—to mount a media campaign focused on countering Dylan's allegations, while working at vindicating her father:Every day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the emails blasted out by Allen's powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a robust publicity campaign to validate my father's sexual relationship with another one of my siblings. Those emails featured talking points ready-made to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer—therapists, lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points—a self-perpetuating spin machine. Farrow believed his sister Dylan and related his concerns with their father going back to when they were young children. In closing, he expressed his view that media culture actively discourages victims of abuse from coming forward. He states that victims are pressured to remain silent by threat of \"having those tough newsroom conversations, making the case for burning bridges with powerful public figures\" as well as \"going up against angry fans and angry publicists\".\n\n\n==== Abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein, start of #MeToo ====\nIn October 2017, The New Yorker published an investigative article by Farrow detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against film producer Harvey Weinstein five days after The New York Times published the findings of its own investigation into Weinstein by the journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey. A year prior, NBC had decided against airing Farrow's initial findings. The New Yorker won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for Farrow's reporting, sharing the award with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey at The New York Times. Farrow was included in Time magazine's \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" list in 2018.\nThe Weinstein allegations of abuse—against a rich powerful man by numerous women whose careers were in ways directed by him—kickstarted an international #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault. The movement began to spread virally in October 2017 as a hashtag on social media in an attempt to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of misogyny, sexual assault, and harassment, especially in the workplace. It followed sexual-abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\n==== Abuse allegations against Eric Schneiderman, and Leslie Moonves ====\nIn May 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Farrow and fellow reporter Jane Mayer stating that, during his term in office, the New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, and that he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs. Schneiderman resigned the following day. Mayer and Farrow reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations with photographs of contusions and with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated that he resigned because they \"effectively prevent me from leading the office's work\".\nTwo months later, in July 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Farrow stating that six women had accused CBS CEO Leslie Moonves of harassment and intimidation, and that dozens more described abuse at his company. In September 2018, Moonves stepped down as Chairman of CBS after multiple women brought forth sexual misconduct allegations against him. Moonves allegedly destroyed evidence of his sexual misconduct.\n\n\n==== Further developments ====\nOn August 23, 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Adam Entous and Farrow stating that top aides of the Trump White House circulated a conspiracy memo entitled \"The Echo Chamber\" about Obama aides.\nOn September 14, 2018, Farrow and Jane Mayer published information pertaining to an allegation of sexual assault by United States Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. The woman making the allegation was revealed to be professor Christine Blasey Ford, who would go on to testify during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing against Kavanaugh, before his successful confirmation to the Supreme Court.\nIn early 2019, Farrow said he and another journalist received demands from American Media, Inc. (AMI) that sought to extort or blackmail him.\nIn the New York Times Ben Smith wrote in 2020 that some quotes in the book were denied by sources in the two chapters dealing with Matt Lauer's relationship with a subordinate – which unquestionably had led to Lauer admitting wrongdoing, apologizing and leaving NBC. Brooke Nevils says in the book that Lauer additionally used some intimate positions which she hadn't agreed to use.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nOverall, the book has received positive reviews. The New York Times, The Guardian, Los Angeles Times, and NPR all reviewed the book positively, praising its reporting as important. Erin Keane also wrote in Salon that Catch and Kill was a \"cinematic page turner\", adding that a \"compelling book that readers can't help but want to finish can make an impact.\" In a review for The Hollywood Reporter, Stephen Galloway called the book a \"monumental work of journalism\", but also wrote that its writing style was lacking.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nCatch and Kill was adapted into a nine-episode podcast based on interviews Farrow did for the book; the podcast was produced by Farrow and Pineapple Street Media. The podcast was later adapted by HBO Documentary Films into a six-part documentary miniseries, Catch and Kill: The Podcast Tapes, that aired in July 2021.\n\n\n== References ==",

The book was published on September 10, 2019 by Penguin Press.\n\n\n== Methodology ==\n\nThe book details the behind-the-scenes and publicly known processes the authors employed to investigate and publish stories uncovering sexual harassment and sexual abuse by high-profile and powerful men including Harvey Weinstein. The book details new information that helped break the Weinstein story, including sources, documents, and chasing leads. It follows the reporters \"from the first exploratory phone calls, to a mounting trail of evidence, to a final face off with a [well known] belligerent\" accused person. The book also deals with the open questions about which behaviors and gray areas should constitute sexual harassment:\n\n Kantor admitted that there is “a mounting sense of unfairness on both sides” about a system that no one thinks “works for the accuser, or the accused.\" Their job remains, as Kantor put it, to ask the three main questions surrounding any allegation: “What is the scope of the behaviors under scrutiny?;” “How do we get the facts right?;” and “What should punishment and accountability look like?”\nThe authors continue to investigate these questions. To help persuade sources to talk to them, the sources were told that what happened in the past cannot be changed but \"together we may be able to use your experience to help protect other people.\"\nGwyneth Paltrow was instrumental in helping the reporter-authors behind the scenes and whose efforts are chronicled in the book. Near the end of the book, the authors discuss Christine Blasey Ford and the choices that led her to publicly confront Brett Kavanaugh, then a Supreme Court nominee.\n\n\n== Circle of influence ==\nThe book chronicles the intersection of executives, companies, lawyers, gossip columnists, tabloid publishers, talent agents, entertainment companies, and public relations (PR) companies that became enmeshed in Weinstein's circle of influence which served to hide and bury information about his behaviors, but was an open secret. Quid pro quo took the form of agreeing to buy film rights to books and stories for \"high-grossing films\", and promising on-screen roles.\nThe focus is on the systemic \"structures of power\" that enabled Weinstein for decades. The reporting, which followed \"whispers and rumors\" occurring over 30 years, was supported by large numbers of interviews with actresses, past and present employees, filings in court, corporate records, and \"internal company communications that documented a thick web of cover-ups, bullying tactics and confidential settlements.\"\n\n\n== Reviews ==\n\nIn her review for The New York Times, Susan Faludi, wrote, \"Kantor and Twohey have crafted their news dispatches into a seamless and suspenseful account of their reportorial journey, a gripping blow-by-blow of how they managed, 'working in the blank spaces between the words,' to corroborate allegations that had been chased and abandoned by multiple journalists before them.

    "description": "All the President's Men is a 1974 non-fiction book by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two of the journalists who investigated the June 1972 break-in at the Watergate Office Building and the resultant political scandal for The Washington Post. The book chronicles the investigative reporting of Woodward and Bernstein from Woodward's initial report on the Watergate break-in through the resignations of Nixon Administration officials H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman in April 1973, and the revelation of the Oval Office Watergate tapes by Alexander Butterfield three months later. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the Post, naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably Hugh Sloan. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward's secret meetings with his source Deep Throat, whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years. Gene Roberts, the former executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and former managing editor of The New York Times, has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein \"maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time.\"\nA film adaptation, starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively, was released in 1976. The same year, a sequel to the book, The Final Days, was published, which chronicled the last months of Richard Nixon's presidency, starting around the time their previous book ended.",

Haldeman and John Ehrlichman in April 1973, and the revelation of the Oval Office Watergate tapes by Alexander Butterfield three months later. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the Post, naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably Hugh Sloan. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward's secret meetings with his source Deep Throat, whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years. Gene Roberts, the former executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and former managing editor of The New York Times, has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein \"maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time.\"\nA film adaptation, starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively, was released in 1976. The same year, a sequel to the book, The Final Days, was published, which chronicled the last months of Richard Nixon's presidency, starting around the time their previous book ended.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWoodward and Bernstein had considered the idea of writing a book about Watergate, but did not commit until actor Robert Redford expressed interest in purchasing the film rights. In Telling the Truth About Lies: The Making of \"All the President's Men\", Woodward noted that Redford played an important role in changing the book's narrative from a story about the Watergate events to one about their investigations and reportage of the story and was thus successful in transferring the content from one medium and one genre to another (see: media adequacy).\nThe name of the book alludes to the nursery rhyme about Humpty Dumpty (\"All the king's horses and all the king's men / Couldn't put Humpty together again\"). An allusion similar to that was made more explicitly a quarter-century earlier in Robert Penn Warren's 1946 novel All the King's Men, which describes the career of a fictional corrupt governor, loosely based on Huey Long.\n\n\n== Important individuals ==\n\n\n=== The President ===\nRichard Nixon\n\n\n=== The President's men ===\nThey are listed with their 1972 positions in either the president's executive staff or in his re-election committee, where applicable.\n\n\n==== White House ====\n\n\n==== Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) ====\n\n\n==== Rest of the President's men ====\n\n\n=== The burglars ===\nBernard L.

A ten-episode television miniseries adaptation aired in 2018 on Hulu.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Looming Tower is largely focused on the people who conspired to commit the September 11 attacks, their motives and personalities, and how they interacted. The book starts with Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian religious scholar who visited the United States in the late 1940s and returned to his home to become an anti-West Islamist and eventually a martyr for his beliefs. There is also a portrait of Ayman al-Zawahiri—from his childhood in Egypt, to his participation in and later leadership of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, to his merging of his organization with Al Qaeda.\nOsama bin Laden is the person described the most, from his childhood in Saudi Arabia in a rich family to his participation in the jihad against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, his role as a financier of terrorist groups, his stay in Sudan, his return to Afghanistan, and his interactions with the Taliban. The 1998 United States embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya are described, as is the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000.\nLawrence Wright also describes in detail some of the Americans involved in counter-terrorism, in particular Richard A. Clarke, chief counter-terrorism adviser on the U.S. National Security Council; Michael Scheuer, head of the CIA's counterterrorist Alec Station; and John P. O'Neill, an assistant deputy director of investigation for the FBI, who served as America's top bin Laden hunter until his retirement from the FBI in August 2001, after which he worked as head of security at the World Trade Center, where he died in the 9/11 attacks.\nThe book also describes some of the problems associated with the lack of cooperation between the FBI, the CIA, and other U.S. government organizations that prevented them from uncovering the 9/11 plot in time.\nBecause The Looming Tower is to a large extent focused on telling the story of the people involved, it does not describe the 9/11 plot and its execution in much detail. It focuses more on the background and the conditions that produced the people who planned and staged the attack and on information about those who were combating terror against the United States.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2006 Los Angeles Times Book Prize\n2006 New York Times Best Seller\n2006 New York Times Notable Book of the Year\n2006 New York Times Best Books of the Year\n2006 IRE Award\n2006 National Book Award finalist\n2006 Time magazine's Best Books of the Year\n2007 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction\n2007 Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism\n2007 J.

Every deceptive comparison with ... other religions is given a respectful hearing. Every ludicrous bit of church dogma is served up deadpan. This makes the book's indictment that much more powerful.\"\nClark Collis reviewed the book for Entertainment Weekly, writing:\n\nLawrence Wright, who won a Pulitzer for 2006's The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, interviewed roughly 200 current and former Scientologists for the book, which began as a 2011 New Yorker article written with Haggis' cooperation. You can feel the heft of the research as he details Hubbard's establishment of the church in the '50s, its globe-spanning infiltration of government agencies in the '70s, and the more recent alleged physical abuse suffered by some members (the Church of Scientology denies many of the claims...) Going Clear is peppered with examples of the church lavishly accommodating its A-list members, particularly Tom Cruise, if not always dealing so well with its famous congregants' quips.\nKaren Swartz reviewed the book for Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, writing that Wright achieves his goal for the book, providing “a rich history that engages current questions,” while allowing for a “more nuanced discourse” of the meaning of religion, while perpetuating a “heavily Protestant understanding.” She also commented that the author recognized the lack of information provided by the Church of Scientology and encouraged readers to research further.\nJoshi Herrmann of the Evening Standard wrote, \"the revelations in Going Clear depict a frightening organisation, capable of imprisoning people often without keeping them imprisoned.\"\nTransworld Publishers, who were to publish the book in the United Kingdom on the same day other publishers around the world released the book, cancelled at the last moment. The book was published in the UK three years later by Silvertail Books, the same publisher for John Sweeney's book The Church of Fear: Inside the Weird World of Scientology. Sweeney speculated that the reason Transworld backed out of their contract for Wright's book was the litigious nature of the Church of Scientology combined with the strong libel laws in England. According to Sweeney, \"You don't need capital to publish a book on Scientology – you need courage.\"\nThe Church of Scientology denied the contents of the book, putting out an official statement and publishing a website.\nWright's German publisher, Random House Publishing Group, provided the web addresses of the Church of Scientology's published responses in a disclaimer in the front of the German edition, and a disclaimer that none of the stories contained in the book concern the German branch of the church.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nThe book was a finalist for the National Book Award for Nonfiction, and was shortlisted for the 2013 National Book Critics Circle Award. It won the nonfiction Carr P. Collins prize of the Texas Institute of Letters.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nThe book was adapted into a documentary film by HBO, directed by Alex Gibney, and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2015. It had been stated by HBO documentary films chief Sheila Nevins that HBO had 160 lawyers review the film out of concerns about litigation by the Church of Scientology. This was later called hyperbole by Gibney, though the film was scrutinized by HBO's lawyers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBook text for free online borrowing at Open Library\nFilm adaption: Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief at IMDb",

    "full_narrative": "Eviction is the removal of a tenant from rental property by the landlord. In some jurisdictions it may also involve the removal of persons from premises that were foreclosed by a mortgagee (often, the prior owners who defaulted on a mortgage).\nDepending on the laws of the jurisdiction, eviction may also be known as unlawful detainer, summary possession, summary dispossess, summary process, forcible detainer, ejectment, and repossession, among other terms. Nevertheless, the term eviction is the most commonly used in communications between the landlord and tenant. Depending on the jurisdiction involved, before a tenant can be evicted, a landlord must win an eviction lawsuit or prevail in another step in the legal process. It should be borne in mind that eviction, as with ejectment and certain other related terms, has precise meanings only in certain historical contexts (e.g., under the English common law of past centuries), or with respect to specific jurisdictions. In present-day practice and procedure, there has come to be a wide variation in the content of these terms from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nThe legal aspects, procedures, and provisions for eviction, by whatever name, vary even between countries or states with similar legal structures.\n\n\n== The eviction process ==\n\nMost jurisdictions do not permit the landlord to evict a tenant without first taking legal action to do so (commonly referred to as a \"self-help\" eviction; such actions include changing locks, removing items from the premises, or terminating utility services). Such evictions are generally illegal at any time during the process (including after a landlord wins an eviction suit); a tenant facing such measures may sue the landlord. However, self-help evictions may be permitted in some jurisdictions when commercial tenants are involved, as opposed to residential tenants.\n\n\n=== Notice ===\nPrior to filing a suit in court for eviction, generally the landlord must provide written notice to the tenant (commonly called a notice to quit or notice to vacate). The residential and commercial ordinances created jurisdictions preventing landlords from taking any action that may force a tenant out of their premises. These actions include, but are not limited to, force and threats, removing essential services, demolishing the property, or interfering with entrance locks.\n\n\n=== Lawsuit and trial ===\nIf the tenant remains in possession of the property after the notice to vacate has expired, the landlord can then serve the tenant with a lawsuit.\nDepending on the jurisdiction, the tenant may be required to submit a written response by a specified date, after which time another date is set for the trial. Other jurisdictions may simply require the tenant to appear in court on a specified date. Eviction cases are often expedited since the issue is time-sensitive (the landlord loses rental income while the tenant remains in possession). A jury trial may be requested by either party; however, until the late 2000s that was very uncommon.\nMany of the defendants in eviction case do not show up for court. In many major cities, including Milwaukee, as many as 70% of defendants are no-shows. In the courts in some urban areas only 10% of defendants showed up.\n\n\n=== Removal from the property ===\nAs mentioned above, most jurisdictions do not allow a landlord to evict a tenant without legal action being taken first, even if the landlord is successful in court.\nInstead, the landlord would have to obtain a writ of possession or warrant of removal from the court and present it to the appropriate law enforcement officer. The officer then posts a notice for the tenant on the property that the officer will remove the tenant and any other people on the property, though some jurisdictions will not enforce the writ if, on that day, inclement weather is taking place.\nWith the removal of the tenant also comes the removal of their personal belongings. If the tenant leaves behind anything of value, there is a custom (but no law in some jurisdictions) for the landlord to hold onto their left-behind belongings for 30 days. After these 30 days the landlord is able to sell the left-behind property, usually in an auction, to satisfy any overdue rent arrears.\n\n\n== No-fault evictions ==\nA no-fault eviction occurs when a landlord seeks to regain possession of a rented property under laws that do not require him to allege any fault on the part of the tenant such as failure to pay rent, disturbance to neighbors or other tenants in the building, or violation of lease terms. In many jurisdictions, a tenancy at will, as opposed to a term lease tenancy, may be ended at any time with a minimum of thirty days' notice to tenant, although some jurisdictions require longer notice periods.\nAs gentrification and the re-population of urban centers by wealthier residents takes place, no-fault evictions are used as a tool to displace tenants in cities with rent control. In California, for example, the Ellis Act allows eviction of rent-controlled tenants if the landlord intends to no longer rent any portion of an apartment building (i.e., landlords cannot be compelled to rent). The Ellis Act has been applied to rentals in San Francisco, Santa Monica and Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Just-cause evictions ==\n\nJust cause eviction, also known as good cause eviction, describes laws that aim to provide tenants protection from unreasonable evictions, rent hikes, and non-renewal of lease agreements. These laws allow tenants to challenge evictions in court when they are not considered to be legitimate evictions. Generally, landlords oppose just-cause eviction laws due to concerns over profit, housing stock, and court cases.\n\n\n=== Renoviction ===\nRenoviction is a term used when a tenant is evicted to renovate a property. A landlord may perform a renoviction to raise the cost of rent for other prospective tenants. In some jurisdictions, such as Ontario, evicted tenants have the right of first refusal.\n\n\n== Retaliatory eviction ==\nRetaliatory eviction occurs when a landlord seeks to evict a tenant in response to the tenant's exercise of legal rights, such as reporting housing code violations, withholding rent for habitability issues, or organizing with other tenants. Most jurisdictions provide statutory protections that create a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if an eviction occurs within a specified period (typically 90 days to one year) after protected tenant activity. Under these laws, the burden shifts to the landlord to prove the eviction is based on legitimate grounds unrelated to the tenant's protected conduct, such as nonpayment of rent or substantial lease violations.\n\n\n== Real estate mobbing ==\nReal estate mobbing, also known as property mobbing, is the use of mobbing (group bullying) techniques by real estate speculators to constructively or forcibly evict a resident from their dwelling. The United Nations has recognized real estate mobbing as a worldwide cause of forced eviction. Real estate mobbing is acknowledged as a problem in Europe and particularly in Spain.\n\n\n== Countries ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nIn the United States of America, rules for evictions and the eviction process are determined by state, county, and city rules.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nIf the tenant is on a fixed term tenancy and their lease is coming to an end, a landlord will be required to give them a valid notice to vacate. The period of this notice varies from state to state. If the tenant will not cooperate with the parameters of an eviction notice, application is made to the Tenancy Tribunal for possession of the property.\nA landlord cannot legally evict a tenant without obtaining a Possession Order and a Warrant of Possession. A Warrant of Possession directs the police to evict a tenant from the property. The police then contact the agent to arrange a time to go to the property, see the tenants off the premises, change the locks and formally take possession. The eviction must always be carried out by the police; the landlord cannot evict tenants themselves. Taking the law into own hands and failing to act according to the relevant legislation in jurisdiction will carry penalties for a landlord.\nOn March 29, 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed that state and territories governments will be moving to put a moratorium on evictions of persons as a result of financial distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The government said these measures were set to last for at least six months.\n\n\n=== Cambodia ===\n\n\n=== China ===\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n\n\n=== Nigeria ===\n\n\n== Impacts on those being evicted ==\n\n\n=== Eviction record ===\nEvictions can remain on a tenant's record for up to seven years in the United States, and landlords are typically allowed to reject tenants due to previous evictions. Public eviction records can be a barrier to entry to housing, leading tenants into emergency shelters after failing tenant screening at multiple apartments. \nSome American jurisdictions have sealed eviction records to prevent blanket denial of tenants with an eviction history.\n\n\n=== Mental health ===\nThere are sometimes communication problems for when the actual eviction date is decided upon, leaving some evictees thoroughly underprepared with nothing packed when the sheriff comes. This can lead to a Skinner box–like experience as evictees sometimes try \"riding\" the eviction out. (This is sometimes caused by denial.)\nEvictees experience higher rates of: depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and even suicide. The process of eviction can take a long time (potentially months) and this can leave the evictee in a heightened state of stress, which makes them more susceptible to stress illnesses. Even after years have passed, studies show that evictees are less happy, optimistic and energetic than those who have not been evicted.\n\n\n=== Economic effects ===\nBeing evicted can increase rates of job loss. A person is 15% more likely to be laid off after experiencing eviction. This can lead to a cycle where the eviction makes it difficult to work but not working can lead to eviction. Evictions are a leading cause of homelessness.\nEvictees often end up moving into poorer quality housing, like overcrowded homes. A study that looked at Milwaukee, Wisconsin found that renters who had been involuntarily moved from a prior residence were 25% more likely to experience long-term housing problems than their peers who had only moved voluntarily.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAccumulation by dispossession – Policies to centralize wealth and power\nCure or quit\nEjectment – Common law term\nEviction resistance – Tactic used by tenants to resist evictions\nForced evictions in China\nForeclosure – Legal process where a lender recoups an unpaid loan\nForcible entry\nLease – Contract to use an asset by paying the owner\nMonopoly on violence\nPopulation transfer – Movement of a large group of people from one region to another\nQuiet title – Lawsuit over ownership of real property\nRetaliatory eviction\nSoldal v.

Behind the Beautiful Forevers received widespread critical acclaim and won the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 2012. It was later adapted into a play by David Hare that premiered at the National Theatre in London.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nBehind the Beautiful Forevers follows the lives of residents in Annawadi, a dense, three acre slum near the Mumbai International Airport. The book centers on Abdul, a young Muslim boy who supports his family by sorting and selling recyclable garbage. Abdul dreams of escaping poverty, but his aspirations are derailed when a neighbor, Fatima, accuses his family of assault after a dispute. Fatima's subsequent self-immolation and death lead to a legal battle that exposes the systemic corruption of the police and judiciary.\nOther prominent figures include Asha, a politically ambitious woman seeking to climb the social ladder by exploiting government programs, and her daughter Manju, who aspires to become Annawadi's first college graduate. Through these and other interconnected stories, Boo illustrates the residents' struggles against poverty, inequality, and bureaucratic oppression, highlighting their resilience and resourcefulness.\nKey events in the narrative include Abdul's arrest and trial, the collapse of Annawadi's sewage lake, and the suicide of a scavenger named Kalu, whose death underscores the precariousness of life in the slum. The book culminates in Abdul's reflections on the moral complexities of survival in an unforgiving environment.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe New York Times praised Boo for her \"unflinching and deeply humane\" portrayal of life in Annawadi.

    "full_narrative": "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness is a 2010 book by Michelle Alexander, a civil rights litigator and legal scholar. The book discusses race-related issues specific to African-American males and mass incarceration in the United States, but Alexander noted that the discrimination faced by African-American males is prevalent among other minorities and socio-economically disadvantaged populations. Alexander's central premise, from which the book derives its title, is that \"mass incarceration is, metaphorically, the New Jim Crow\".\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThough the conventional point of view holds that systemic racial discrimination mostly ended with the civil rights movement reforms of the 1960s, Alexander posits that the U.S. criminal justice system uses the war on drugs as a primary tool for enforcing traditional, as well as new, modes of discrimination and oppression. These new modes of racism have led to not only the highest rate of incarceration in the world, but also a disproportionately large rate of imprisonment for African American men. Were present trends to continue, Alexander writes, the United States would imprison one third of its African American population. When combined with the fact that whites are more likely to commit drug crimes than people of color, the issue becomes clear for Alexander: \"the primary targets of [the penal system's] control can be defined largely by race\".\nThis ultimately leads Alexander to argue that mass incarceration is \"a stunningly comprehensive and well-disguised system of racialized social control that functions in a manner strikingly similar to Jim Crow\". The culmination of this social control is what Alexander calls a \"racial caste system\", a type of stratification wherein people of color are kept in an inferior position. Its emergence, she believes, is a direct response to the civil rights movement. It is because of this that Alexander argues for issues with mass incarceration to be addressed as issues of racial justice and civil rights. To approach these matters as anything but would be to fortify this new racial caste. Thus, Alexander aims to mobilize the civil rights community to move the incarceration issue to the forefront of its agenda and to provide factual information, data, arguments and a point of reference for those interested in pursuing the issue. Her broader goal is the revamping of the prevailing mentality regarding human rights, equality and equal opportunities in America, to prevent future cyclical recurrence of what she sees as \"racial control under changing disguise\". According to the author, what has been altered since the collapse of Jim Crow is not so much the basic structure of US society, as the language used to justify its affairs. She argues that when people of color are disproportionately labeled as \"criminals\", this allows the unleashing of a whole range of legal discrimination measures in employment, housing, education, public benefits, voting rights, jury duty, and so on.\nAlexander explains that it took her years to become fully aware and convinced of the entanglements she describes, despite her professional civil rights background. She expects similar reluctance and disbelief on the part of many of her readers. She believes that the problems besetting African American communities are not merely a passive, collateral side effect of poverty, limited educational opportunity or other factors, but a consequence of purposeful government policies. Alexander has concluded that mass incarceration policies, which were swiftly developed and implemented, are a \"comprehensive and well-disguised system of racialized control that functions in a manner strikingly similar to Jim Crow\".\nAlexander contends that in 1982 the Reagan administration began an escalation of the war on drugs, purportedly as a response to a crack cocaine crisis in black ghettos, which was (she claims) announced well before crack cocaine arrived in most inner city neighborhoods. During the mid-1980s, as the use of crack cocaine increased to epidemic levels in these neighborhoods, federal drug authorities publicized the problem, using scare tactics to generate support for their already-declared escalation. The government's successful media campaign made possible an unprecedented expansion of law enforcement activities in America's urban neighborhoods, and this aggressive approach fueled widespread belief in conspiracy theories that posited government plans to destroy the black population (Black genocide) \nIn 1998, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) acknowledged that during the 1980s the Contra faction—covertly supported by the US in Nicaragua—had been involved in smuggling cocaine into the US and distributing it in US cities. Drug Enforcement Administration efforts to expose these illegal activities were blocked by Reagan officials, which contributed to an explosion of crack cocaine consumption in America's urban neighborhoods. More aggressive enforcement of federal drug laws resulted in a dramatic increase in street level arrests for possession. Disparate sentencing policies (the crack cocaine vs. powdered cocaine penalty disparity was 100–1 by weight and remains 18–1 even after recent reform efforts) meant that a disproportionate number of inner city residents were charged with felonies and sentenced to long prison terms, because they tended to purchase the more affordable crack version of cocaine, rather than the powdered version commonly consumed in the suburbs.\nAlexander argues that the war on drugs has a devastating impact on inner city African American communities, on a scale entirely out of proportion to the actual dimensions of criminal activity taking place within these communities.\nDuring the past three decades, the US prison population exploded from 300,000 to more than two million, with the majority of the increase due to drug convictions. This led to the US having the world's highest incarceration rate. The US incarceration rate is eight times that of Germany, a comparatively developed large democracy.\nAlexander claims that the US is unparalleled in the world in focusing enforcement of federal drug laws on racial and ethnic minorities. In the capital city of Washington, D.C., three out of four young African American males are expected to serve time in prison. While studies show that quantitatively Americans of different races consume illegal drugs at similar rates, in some states black men have been sent to prison on drug charges at rates twenty to fifty times those of white men. The proportion of African American men with some sort of criminal record approaches 80% in some major US cities, and they become marginalized, part of what Alexander calls \"a growing and permanent undercaste\".\nAlexander maintains that this undercaste is hidden from view, invisible within a maze of rationalizations, with mass incarceration its most serious manifestation. Alexander borrows from the term \"racial caste\", as it is commonly used in scientific literature, to create \"undercaste\", denoting a \"stigmatized racial group locked into inferior position by law and custom\". By mass incarceration she refers to the web of laws, rules, policies and customs that make up the criminal justice system and which serve as a gateway to permanent marginalization in the undercaste. Once released from prison, new members of this undercaste face a \"hidden underworld of legalized discrimination and permanent social exclusion\".\nAccording to Alexander, crime and punishment are poorly correlated, and the present US criminal justice system has effectively become a system of social control unparalleled in any other Western democracy, with its targets largely defined by race. The rate of incarceration in the US has soared, while its crime rates have generally remained similar to those of other Western countries, where incarceration rates have remained stable. The current rate of incarceration in the US is six to ten times greater than in other industrialized nations, and Alexander maintains that this disparity is not correlated to the fluctuation of crime rates, but can be traced mostly to the artificially invoked War on Drugs and its associated discriminatory policies. The US embarked on an unprecedented expansion of its juvenile detention and prison systems.\nAlexander notes that the civil rights community has been reluctant to get involved in this issue, concentrating primarily on protecting affirmative action gains, which mainly benefit an elite group of high-achieving African Americans. At the other end of the social spectrum are the young black men who are under active control of the criminal justice system (currently in prison, or on parole or probation)—approximately one-third of the young black men in the US. Criminal justice was not listed as a top priority of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in 2007 and 2008, or of the Congressional Black Caucus in 2009. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have been involved in legal action, and grassroots campaigns have been organized, however Alexander feels that generally there is a lack of appreciation of the enormity of the crisis. According to her, mass incarceration is \"the most damaging manifestation of the backlash against the Civil Rights Movement\", and those who feel that the election of Barack Obama represents the ultimate \"triumph over race\", and that race no longer matters, are dangerously misguided.\nAlexander writes that Americans are ashamed of their racial history, and therefore avoid talking about race, or even class, so the terms used in her book may seem unfamiliar to many. Americans want to believe that everybody is capable of upward mobility, given enough effort on his or her part; this assumption forms a part of the national collective self-image. Alexander points out that a large percentage of African Americans are hindered by the discriminatory practices of an ostensibly colorblind criminal justice system, which end up creating an undercaste where upward mobility is severely constrained.\nAlexander believes that the existence of the New Jim Crow system is not disproved by the election of Barack Obama and other examples of exceptional achievement among African Americans, but on the contrary the New Jim Crow system depends on such exceptionalism. She contends that the system does not require overt racial hostility or bigotry on the part of another racial group or groups. Indifference is sufficient to support the system. Alexander argues that the system reflects an underlying racial ideology and will not be significantly disturbed by half-measures such as laws mandating shorter prison sentences. Like its predecessors, the new system of racial control has been largely immune from legal challenge. She writes that a human tragedy is unfolding, and The New Jim Crow is intended to stimulate a much-needed national discussion \"about the role of the criminal justice system in creating and perpetuating racial hierarchy in the United States\".\n\n\n== Defining \"incarceration\" ==\nAlexander states in the book that she was \"careful to define 'mass incarceration' to include those who were subject to state control outside of prison walls, as well as those who were locked in literal cages\". The scope of Alexander's definition of \"incarceration\" includes people who have been arrested (but not tried), people on parole and people who have been released but labelled as \"criminals\". Alexander's definition is intentionally much broader than the subset of individuals currently in physical detention.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nDarryl Pinckney, writing in The New York Review of Books, called the book one that would \"touch the public and educate social commentators, policymakers, and politicians about a glaring wrong that we have been living with that we also somehow don't know how to face ... [Alexander] is not the first to offer this bitter analysis, but NJC is striking in the intelligence of her ideas, her powers of summary, and the force of her writing\".\nJennifer Schuessler, writing in The New York Times, notes that Alexander presents voluminous evidence in the form of both statistics and legal cases to argue that the tough-on-crime policies begun under the Nixon administration and amplified under Reagan's war on drugs have devastated black America, where nearly one-third of black men are likely to spend time in prison during their lifetimes, and where many of these men will be second-class citizens afterwards. Schuessler also notes that Alexander's book goes further, by asserting that the increase in incarceration was a deliberate effort to roll back civil rights gains, rather than a true response to increased rates of violent crime. Schuessler notes that the book has galvanized both black and white readers, some of whom view the work as giving voice to deep feelings that the criminal justice system is stacked against blacks, while others might question its portrayal of anti-crime policies as primarily motivated by racial animus.\nForbes wrote that Alexander \"looks in detail at what economists usually miss\", and \"does a fine job of truth-telling, pointing the finger where it rightly should be pointed: at all of us, liberal and conservative, white and black\".\nThe book received a starred review in Publishers Weekly, saying that Alexander \"offers an acute analysis of the effect of mass incarceration upon former inmates\" who will be legally discriminated against for the rest of their lives, and described the book as \"carefully researched, deeply engaging, and thoroughly readable\".\nJames Forman Jr. argues that though the book has value in focusing scholars (and society as a whole) on the failures of the criminal justice system, it obscures African-American support for tougher crime laws and downplays the role of violent crime in the story of incarceration.\nJohn McWhorter, writing in The New Republic, praised the book for its criticism of the Drug War, but argued that Alexander had simplified the causes of the mass incarceration problem, noting that many Black leaders favored escalating the war on drugs in the 1990s.\nJohn Pfaff, in his book Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform, criticizes Alexander's assertion that the war on drugs is responsible for mass incarceration. Among his findings are that drug offenders make up only a small part of the prison population, and non-violent drug offenders an even smaller portion; that people convicted of violent crimes make up the majority of prisoners; that county and state justice systems account for the large majority of American prisoners and not the federal system that handles most drug cases; and, subsequently, \"national\" statistics tell a distorted story when differences in enforcement, conviction, and sentencing are widely disparate between states and counties. The Brookings Institution reconciles the differences between Alexander and Pfaff by explaining two ways to look at the prison population as it relates to drug crimes, concluding \"The picture is clear: Drug crimes have been the predominant reason for new admissions into state and federal prisons in recent decades\" and \"rolling back the war on drugs would not, as Pfaff and Urban Institute scholars maintain, totally solve the problem of mass incarceration, but it could help a great deal, by reducing exposure to prison.\"\nIn 2018, The New Jim Crow was listed as one of several banned books that inmates in New Jersey state correctional facilities could not possess.\nThe 10th anniversary edition (2020) was discussed with Ellen DeGeneres on The Ellen Show on network TV, and reviewed on the front page of the New York Times Book Review section on January 19, 2020.\nThe New Jim Crow was listed in The Chronicle of Higher Education as one of the 11 best scholarly books of the 2010s, chosen by Stefan M. Bradley. In 2024, it was ranked #69 in the New York Times list of best 100 books of the 21st century.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nWinner, NAACP Image Awards (Outstanding Non-fiction, 2011)\nWinner of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency's Prevention for a Safer Society (PASS) Award\nWinner of the Constitution Project's 2010 Constitutional Commentary Award\n2010 IPPY Award: Silver Medal in Current Events II (Social Issues/Public Affairs/Ecological/Humanitarian) category\nWinner of the 2010 Association of Humanist Sociology Book Award\nFinalist, Silver Gavel Award\nFinalist, Phi Beta Kappa Emerson Award\nFinalist, Letitia Woods Brown Book Award\n\n\n== Translations ==\nSpanish: El color de la justicia: la nueva segregación racial en Estados Unidos, lit. 'The Colour of Justice: The New Racial Segregation in the United States'.

ISBN 9781620972748.\n\n\n== Notes ==\na.^ The persistently lingering result of the lack of land reform, of the fact that the former slaves were not granted any of the property on which they had long labored (unlike many European serfs, emancipated and economically empowered to various degrees by that time, their American counterparts ended up with nothing), is the present extremely inequitable distribution of wealth in the United States along racial lines. 150 years after the Civil War, the median wealth of a black family is a small fraction of the median wealth of a white family.\nb.^ According to Ruth W. Grant of Duke University, the author of the book Strings Attached: Untangling the Ethics of Incentives (Princeton University Press 2011, ISBN 978-0-691-15160-1), the expediency-based plea bargain process, in which 90 to 95% of felony prosecutions never go to trial, but are settled by the defendant pleading guilty, undermines the purpose and challenges the legitimacy of the justice system. Justice won't take place, because \"either the defendant is guilty, but gets off easy by copping a plea, or the defendant is innocent but pleads guilty to avoid the risk of greater punishment\". The question of guilt is decided without adjudicating the evidence-the fundamental process of determining the truth and assigning proportionate punishment does not take place.\nc.^ Michelle Alexander suggested in a March 2012 New York Times article a possible strategy (she attributed the idea to Susan Burton) for coping with the unjust criminal justice system. If large numbers of the accused could be persuaded to opt out of plea bargaining and demand a full trial by jury, to which they are constitutionally entitled, the criminal justice system in its present form would be unable to continue because of lack of resources (it would \"crash\"). This last resort strategy is controversial, as some would end up with extremely harsh sentences, but, it is argued, progress often cannot be made without sacrifice.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The book won the 2015 National Book Award for Nonfiction and was a finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.\n\n\n== Publication ==\n\nCoates was inspired to write Between the World and Me following a 2013 meeting with sitting United States President Barack Obama. Coates, a writer for The Atlantic, had been reading James Baldwin's 1963 The Fire Next Time and was determined to make his second meeting with the president less deferential than his first. As he left for Washington, D.C., his wife encouraged him to think like Baldwin, and Coates recalled an unofficial, fiery meeting between Baldwin, Black activists, and Robert F. Kennedy in 1963. When it was his turn, Coates debated with Obama whether his policy sufficiently addressed racial disparities in the universal health care rollout. After the event, Obama and Coates spoke privately about a blog post Coates had written criticizing the president's call for more personal responsibility among African Americans. Obama disagreed with the criticism and told Coates not to despair.\nAs Coates walked to the train station, he thought about how Baldwin would not have shared Obama's optimism, the same optimism that supported many Civil Rights Movement activists' belief that justice was inevitable. Instead, Coates saw Baldwin as being fundamentally \"cold\", without \"sentiment and melodrama\" in his acknowledgment that the movement could fail and that requital was not guaranteed. Coates found this idea \"freeing\" and called his book editor, Christopher Jackson, to ask \"why no one wrote like Baldwin anymore.\" Jackson proposed that Coates try.\nBetween the World and Me is Coates's second book, following his 2008 memoir The Beautiful Struggle. Since then, and especially in the 18 months including the Ferguson unrest preceding his new book's release, Coates somberly believed less in the soul and its aspirational sense of eventual justice. Coates felt that he had become more radicalized.\n\n\n== Title ==\nThe book's title comes from Richard Wright's poem \"Between the World and Me\", originally published in the July/August 1935 issue of Partisan Review. Wright's poem is about a Black man discovering the site of a lynching and becoming incapacitated with fear, creating a barrier between himself and the world. Despite Between the World and Me undergoing many changes as the book was revised, Coates always planned to end with the story of Mabel Jones. The only endorsement Coates sought was that of novelist Toni Morrison, which he received. Between the World and Me was published by Spiegel & Grau in 2015.\nThe phrase \"between the world and me\" is literally in the text of Baldwin's The Fire Next Time.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\nBetween the World and Me takes the form of a book-length letter from the author to his son, adopting the structure of Baldwin's The Fire Next Time; the latter is directed, in part, towards Baldwin's nephew, while the former addresses Coates's 15-year-old son. Coates's letter is divided into three parts, recounting Coates's experiences as a young man, after the birth of his son, and during a visit with Mabel Jones. Coates contemplates the feelings, symbolism, and realities associated with being Black in the United States. He recapitulates the American history of violence against Black people and the incommensurate policing of Black youth. The book's tone is poetic and bleak, guided by his experiences growing up poor and always at risk of bodily harm. He prioritizes the physical security of African-American bodies over the tradition in Black Christianity of optimism, \"uplift\", and faith in eventual justice (i.e., being on God's side). As Coates discussed in a 2015 interview at the Chicago Humanities Festival, he was inspired by his college professor Eileen Boris who utilized an extended metaphor of the physical body for exploitation by objectification in her course, “History of Women in America\" at Howard University. Her teachings inspired Coates's theme of the physical and visceral experience of racism on the body. His background, which he describes as \"physicality and chaos\", leads him to emphasize the daily corporeal concerns he experiences as an African-American in U.S. culture. Coates's position is that absent the religious rhetoric of \"hope and dreams and faith and progress\", only systems of White supremacy remain along with no real evidence that those systems are bound to change. In this way, he disagrees with Martin Luther King, Jr.'s optimism about integration and Malcolm X's optimism about nationalism.\nCoates gives an abridged, autobiographical account of his youth \"always on guard\" in Baltimore and his fear of the physical harm threatened by both the police and the streets. He also feared the rules of code-switching to meet the clashing social norms of the streets, the authorities, and the professional world. He contrasts these experiences with neat suburban life, which he calls \"the Dream\" because it is an exclusionary fantasy for White people who are enabled by, yet largely ignorant of, their history of privilege and suppression. To become conscious of their gains from slavery, segregation, and voter suppression would shatter that Dream. The book ends with a story about Mabel Jones, the daughter of a sharecropper, who worked and rose in social class to give her children comfortable lives, including private schools and European trips. Her son, Coates's college friend Prince Carmen Jones Jr., was mistakenly tracked and killed by a policeman. Coates uses his friend's story to argue that racism and related tragedy affects Black people of means as well.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAfter reading Between the World and Me, novelist Toni Morrison wrote that Coates fills \"the intellectual void\" left by James Baldwin's death 28 years prior. A. O. Scott of The New York Times said the book is \"essential, like water or air\". David Remnick of The New Yorker described it as \"extraordinary\".\nIn Politico, Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review, cited Coates' \"monstrous\" passage about Black people who died in 9/11. Most people, wrote Lowry, would not think, as Coates did, \"They were not human to me. Black, white, or whatever, they were menaces of nature; they were the fire, the comet, the storm, which could — with no justification — shatter my body.\"\nMichiko Kakutani of The New York Times wrote that the phrasing of his comments on 9/11 could be easily misread. Between the World and Me functioned as a sequel to Coates's 2008 memoir, which displayed Coates's talents as an emotional and lyrical writer. Coates's use of \"the Dream\" (in reference to paradisal suburban life) confused her, and she thought Coates stretched beyond what is safely generalizable. Kakutani thought that Coates did not consistently acknowledge racial progress achieved over the course of centuries and that some parts read like the author's internal debate. Benjamin Wallace-Wells of New York magazine said that a sense of fear for one's children propels the book, and Coates's atheism gives the book a sense of urgency.\nOn November 18, 2015, it was announced that Coates had won the National Book Award for Between the World and Me. NPR's Colin Dwyer had considered it the favorite to win the prize, given the book's reception. It also won the 2015 Kirkus Prize for nonfiction.\nThe book topped The New York Times Best Seller list for nonfiction on August 2, 2015, and remained number 1 for three weeks. It topped the same list again during the week of January 24, 2016.\nThe book was selected by Washington University in St. Louis and Augustana College in 2016, as the book for all first-year students to read and discuss in the fall 2016 semester. In the same year, the book was ranked 7th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.\nIn September 2020, Mercer County public schools pulled the book from class.\nIn February 2023, an AP English teacher in South Carolina's Lexington & Richland County School District Five was forced to halt a lesson on the book by school administrators, who claimed that the lesson violated state budget provisions. South Carolina law prohibits the use of state funds for lessons that teach that \"an individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of his race or sex\" or \"an individual, by virtue of his race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.\" Coates attended the school board meeting about the incident. He wrote about it in his book, The Message.\n\n\n== Editions and translations ==\nHardcover, English. Spiegel & Grau; 1st edition (July 14, 2015), ISBN 978-0812993547\nE-book, English.

Kendi, published April 12, 2016 by Bold Type Books, an imprint of PublicAffairs. The book won the National Book Award for Nonfiction.\nThe book also has two \"remixes\" for children, Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You and Stamped (for Teens): Racism, Antiracism, and You. A graphic novel version, adapted and illustrated by Joel Christian Gill, was published in June 2023.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nStamped from the Beginning was generally well-received by critics, including a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, who called the book \"ambitious\" and \"magisterial.\"\nLibrary Journal's Thomas J. Davis concluded that Stamped from the Beginning \"is a must for serious readers of American history, politics, or social thought.\"\nThe Guardian's David Olusoga called the book \"brilliant and disturbing\" and explained that some readers find the book disturbing \"because of the author’s fearless reappraisals of the words, actions and philosophies of some of the more revered heroes of American abolitionism and civil rights – including African American heroes,\" including William Lloyd Garrison and W. E. B. Du Bois. He further states, \"Perhaps what is most disturbing about Kendi’s work is that it shows how the same racial ideas, dressed in different period costumes, have been repeatedly used to explain away the deaths of generations of African Americans, slaves, victims of Jim Crow lynchings and, in the 21st-century, casualties of police shootings.\"\nAlso writing for The Guardian, Mark Anthony Neal writes, \"I can't say whether Ibram X Kendi's Stamped from the Beginning will offend most white people (though I'm willing to bet it will offend some), but he damn sure names white supremacy for what it is.\"\nSadiah Qureshi, writing for New Statesman, referred to the book as \"a lucid, accessible survey of how 'the people' were racialised over 500 years.\" She further stated, \"One might expect Kendi to be despondent, but he believes that eradicating discriminatory policies will consign racist ideas to the past ... an un-yielding narrative of racist ideas, violence and harm. However, the book is also a history of refusals.\"\nBooklist's Rebecca Vnuk commented on Kendi's writing, highlighting how the book is \"heavily researched yet easily readable.\" She further explains, \"The hope here is that by studying and remembering the lessons of history, we may be able to move forward to an equitable society.\"\nThe Washington Post's Carlos Lozada provided a mixed review, writing, \"The greatest service Kendi and provide[s] is the ruthless prosecution of American ideas about race for their tensions, contradictions and unintended consequences. And yet I have greater difficulty embracing the notion that, as Kendi argues, progress on race is inevitably stalked by the advance of racism and that, on an individual level, falling short in specific instances somehow taints the whole of a person ... The old one-drop rule for determining race was based on prejudice and pseudoscience. A one-drop rule for determining racism seems only slightly less unfair, no matter how well-intentioned.\"\nPolitical scientist and activist Norman Finkelstein locates the book within Kendi's broader body of work, which he describes as \"fatuous, almost juvenile,\" dependent upon \"binary, wooden labels\" in the absence of a critical framework, \"more fashion statement than political manifesto,\" and frequently \"bizarre.\"\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nKirkus Reviews named Stamped from the Beginning one of the best books of 2016.\n\n\n== Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You ==\n\nKendi wrote Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You with Jason Reynolds, \"remixing\" Stamped from the Beginning for a younger audience. The book was published March 10, 2020 by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nStamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You is adapted from Stamped: From the Beginning, originally written by Kendi. The first book, published in 2016, focuses on historical figures. However, Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You follows a chronological format. Kendi reached out to Reynolds to collaborate on a chronological version after seeing success with his first book. Reynolds first declined Kendi's proposal, adamant that he was a fiction writer. It took a writing style that made Stamped \"not a history book\" to get Reynolds on board with the idea.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nKendi and Reynolds insist throughout the book that \"it is not a history book\" and writes in a casual, easy-to-understand manner, using slang and pop culture references to cater to the younger audience. There are five sections split by time periods: 1415–1728, 1743–1826, 1826–1879, 1868–1963, and 1963-today. The chapters vary in length and there are 28 in total. In these chapters, Kendi and Reynolds focus on important, often overlooked figures and events to illustrate the development of racist ideas throughout the history of the United States. Throughout the book, Kendi and Reynolds return to the themes of racists, assimilationists, and antiracists, and the book ends by encouraging readers to take what they have learned from the book and to become antiracist. \n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nStamped received numerous positive reviews, including starred reviews from Booklist, Kirkus Reviews, and Publishers Weekly.\nKirkus Reviews called the book \"impressive and much needed.\"\nPublishers Weekly comments on the book's writing style, stating, \"Short chapters, lively phrasing..., and intentional breaks ... help maintain a brisk, compelling pace. Told impressively economically, loaded with historical details that connect clearly to current experiences, and bolstered with suggested reading and listening selected specifically for young readers, Kendi and Reynolds’s volume is essential, meaningfully accessible reading.\"\nBooklist's Jessica Agudel wrote that the book's encouragement of readers to \"emerge as critical thinkers who can decipher coded language and harmful imagery stemming from racist ideas, which still linger in modern society and popular culture, will be the most empowering result.\" She concludes that Stamped should be \"required reading for everyone especially those invested in the future of\" young people in America.\"\nShelf Awareness's Siân Gaetano highlights how \"Reynolds.. makes Stamped a conversation with the reader,\" saying, \"This approach, in less capable hands, could go horribly wrong ... But it is what makes Reynolds's interpretation so successful. Stamped is approachable: his tone is welcoming, helpful, easygoing and informal, even though--because--his topic is the shameful, disgusting and brutal history and present of racism.\"\nThe audiobook edition, narrated by Jason Reynolds, also received a starred review from Booklist's Terry Hong, who stated, Stamped—both printed and aural—is an undeniable gift to lucky audiences; either/both must be required reading for all. Hong also highlighted how Reynolds \"transform[ed Kendi's] illuminating words into something akin to a riveting open-mic, poetry-slam performance,\" stating, \"Listeners’ heads will undoubtedly be bobbing in absorbed agreement.\" Hong's \"only complaint throughout\" are \"the between-chapter gameshow-esque cacophonous interruptions.\"\n\n\n=== Awards and honors ===\nStamped was a New York Times Bestseller. Kirkus Reviews named it one of the best books of 2020.\n\n\n=== Censorship ===\nIn 2020, Stamped landed the second position on the American Library Association's list of the most commonly banned and challenged books in the United States. The book was banned, challenged, and/or restricted \"because of author’s public statements, and because of claims that the book contains 'selective storytelling incidents' and does not encompass racism against all people.\"\n\n\n== Stamped (for Kids): Racism, Antiracism, and You ==\n\nStamped (for Kids): Racism, Antiracism, and You was published May 11, 2021 by Little, Brown Young Readers. The book was written by Ibram X. Kendi and Jason Reynolds, illustrated by Rachelle Baker, and adapted by Sonja Cherry-Paul.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nStamped (for Kids) received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, who called the books \"exhilarating, excellent, [and] necessary.\"\nBooklist's Jessica Agudelo highlighted how Cherry-Paul \"skillfully carried over\" the \"conservational tone\" created in the previous installments of the book. She also discussed the book's artistry, saying, \"Baker’s gray-scale illustrations provide an effective visual language for the intended audience and are featured varyingly as spot art and full-page depictions.\"\nCommon Sense Media gave Stamped (for Kids) three out of five stars, who noted that the book's concepts and language \"[seem] inaccessible to 6- to 8-year-old children at the younger end of the publisher's target audience.\" They explain their position by stating, \"The content veers between young-kid-friendly discussions ... to very adult-oriented, abstract language and concepts.\"\n\n\n=== Awards and honors ===\nStamped (for Kids) is a New York Times Bestseller. Kirkus Reviews named it one of the best books of 2021. In 2022, the Association for Library Service to Children included it on their \"Notable Children's Books\" list.\n\n\n== Stamped from the Beginning: A Graphic History of Racist Ideas in America ==\n\nStamped from the Beginning: A Graphic History of Racist Ideas in America, adapted to graphic novel form by Joel Christian Gill, was published June 6, 2023.\nA documentary film by Roger Ross Williams was also submitted for Oscar consideration.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInterview at New Books Network\nInterview at Slate\nInterview with Kendi on Stamped from the Beginning at the Tucson Festival of Books, March 11, 2017, C-SPAN\nInterview with Kendi on Stamped from the Beginning at Printers Row Lit Fest, June 10, 2017, C-SPAN\nInterview with Kendi on Stamped from the Beginning at the Busboys and Poets Bookstore, August 29, 2017, C-SPAN",

    "full_narrative": "How to Be an Antiracist is a 2019 nonfiction book by American author and historian Ibram X. Kendi, which combines social commentary and memoir. It was published by One World, an imprint of Random House. The book discusses concepts of racism and Kendi's proposals for anti-racist individual actions and systemic changes.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKendi is the founder of the Antiracist Research & Policy Center at American University in Washington, D.C.\nHow to Be an Antiracist expands on ideas from Kendi's previous book, Stamped from the Beginning, which won the National Book Award in 2016.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book is organized into chapters that each examine a different theme through a racial lens. These themes include \"dueling consciousness\", \"power\", \"biology\", \"ethnicity\", \"body\", \"culture\", \"behavior\", \"color\", \"white\", \"black\", \"class\", \"space\", \"gender\", and \"sexuality\".\nKendi relates his evolving concept of racism through the events of his own life over four decades, touching on observations and experiences as a child, young adult, student, and professor, from classes he has taught, via contemporary events such as the O. J. Simpson robbery case and 2000 United States presidential election, and through historical events such as the scientific proposals of polygenism in Europe in the 1600s and racial segregation in the United States.\nKendi further details the manifestations of racism, such as scientific racism, colorism and their intersection with demographics including gender, class and sexuality, arguing that racism is founded in both patriarchy and capitalism.\nKendi argues that the opposite of racist is anti-racist rather than simply non-racist, and that there is no middle ground in the struggle against racism; one is either actively confronting racial inequality or allowing it to exist through action or inaction.\nHe defines racism as any policy that creates inequitable outcomes between people of different skin colors; for instance, affirmative action in college admissions is anti-racist in that is designed to remedy past racial discrimination, while inaction on climate change is racist because of the disproportionately severe impacts of climate change in the predominantly non-white Global South.\nKendi defines a racist person as anyone who supports racist policies \"through their actions or inaction or expressing a racist idea\", while an anti-racist person is someone who supports anti-racist policies \"through their actions or expressing an antiracist idea\".\nHe draws upon what he describes as his own lifelong racism to argue that anyone, regardless of race, can be racist when they express harmful stereotypes about entire groups.\nKendi relates how he once accepted certain stereotypes about black people, such as that black youth devalue education, and how he once wore colored contact lenses in order to not \"look black\". He calls such internalized racism \"the real black on black crime\".\nKendi disagrees with the prejudice plus power model of racism, which would not allow for Black racism.\nFinally, Kendi suggests models for anti-racist individual actions and systemic (i.e. policy) changes. \nHe uses the metaphor of racism as a cancer to argue for society-wide \"treatments\" such as ending racist policies (as one might remove a tumor), \"exercising\" anti-racist ideas, consuming \"healthy food for thought\", and being vigilant toward a recurrence of racism \"before it can grow and threaten the body politic\".\nRather than presenting a how-to guide, Kendi uses his own experience as an example of shifting one's focus from the personal to the systemic regarding racial issues. \nHe argues that \"being antiracist requires persistent self-awareness, constant self-criticism, and regular self-examination\".\n\n\n== Sales ==\nHow to Be an Antiracist was named one of Time's \"must-read\" books of 2019.\nIn June 2020, following protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, sales of the book surged,\nand it became a best seller on Amazon.com.\nThe book was listed eighth and fifth in Publishers Weekly's hardcover non-fiction list on May 30 and June 6, respectively.\nIt was listed third in USA Today's best-selling books list of June 10.\nThe book reached #1 on The New York Times Best Seller List in Hardcover Nonfiction list for sales in the week ending June 6.\nBy March 24, 2021, it had spent 45 weeks on the list.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe book received starred reviews in Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, and Kirkus Reviews.\nPublishers Weekly described Kendi's prose as \"thoughtful, sincere and polished\" and the book's ideas as \"boldly articulated\" and \"historically informed\", stating that the book would \"spark many conversations\".\nKirkus Reviews found it to be \"not an easy read but an essential one\".\nLibrary Journal said that \"[Kendi's] stories serv[e] as a springboard for potent explorations of race, gender, [and] colorism\".\nA review in Journal of Communication Inquiry said the book \"succeeds at fitting into many genres including autobiography, memoir, and even how-to guide\" and that it was \"commendable\" how Kendi presents cultural concepts through stories from his own life.\nA review in the journal Urban Education described the book as \"necessary for all echelons of education\".\nBlack studies scholar Jeffrey C. Stewart called it the \"most courageous book to date on the problem of race in the Western mind\".\nProfessor of civil rights law Randall Kennedy said the book displays candor, independence, and self-criticality, but that it has major flaws, especially being internally contradictory and poorly reasoned.\nEricka Taylor of NPR described the book as \"clear and compelling\" and \"accessible\", saying it \"exemplifies a commitment to clarity\".\nA review in The Christian Science Monitor called the book \"thought-provoking and insightful\" and an \"important and necessary contribution\" toward understanding racism in the United States.\nJournalist Afua Hirsch writes that Kendi shows \"honesty in linking his personal struggles\" to the book's subject, which Hirsch describes as \"brilliantly simple\" and \"dogmatic\", but that the book's personal anecdotes seem incomplete and the style resembles that of a textbook too much.\nIt was the Book of the Day in a review for The Observer in which Colin Grant found that the book \"encourages self-reflection\" and described the writing style as \"calm\" but \"insightful\".\nCommentator Andrew Sullivan wrote that the book has the character of a religious tract with overly simplistic distinctions between good and evil that cannot be falsified, and is sparse on practical suggestions.\nBehavior geneticist Kathryn Paige Harden argues that while \"race is not a valid biological category\", Kendi is nonetheless incorrect for stating in the book that \"there are no genetic differences between groups of people who identify as different races\". Harden points to this as an example of \"moral commitments to racial equality\" being \"on shaky ground if they depend on exact genetic sameness across human populations\".\nGeneticist Joseph L. Graves Jr. calls this a straw man, writing in The Lancet that Harden misses \"a central point: human populations do not differ substantially in the frequencies of genetic variants that determine their complex behaviour, including intelligence and personality.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKendi, Ibram X.

    "full_narrative": "The Souls of Black Folk: Essays and Sketches is a  1903 work of American literature by W. E. B. Du Bois. It is a seminal work in the history of sociology and a cornerstone of African-American literature.\nThe book contains several essays on race, some of which had been published earlier in The Atlantic Monthly. To develop this work, Du Bois drew from his own experiences as an African American in American society. Outside of its notable relevance in African-American history, The Souls of Black Folk also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works in the field of sociology.\nIn The Souls of Black Folk, Du Bois used the term \"double consciousness\", perhaps taken from Ralph Waldo Emerson (\"The Transcendentalist\" and \"Fate\"), applying it to the idea that black people must have two fields of vision at all times. They must be conscious of how they view themselves, as well as being conscious of how the world views them.\n\n\n== Chapters ==\nEach chapter in The Souls of Black Folk begins with a pair of epigraphs: text from a poem, usually by a European poet, and the musical score of a spiritual, which Du Bois describes in his foreword (\"The Forethought\") as \"some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from black souls in the dark past\". Columbia University English and comparative literature professor Brent Hayes Edwards writes:\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that Du Bois ... chooses not to include the lyrics to the spirituals, which often serve to underline the arguments of the chapters: Booker T. Washington's idealism is echoed in the otherworldly salvation hoped for in \"A Great Camp-Meeting in the Promised Land\", for example; likewise the determined call for education in \"Of the Training of Black Men\" is matched by the strident words of \"March On\".\nEdwards adds that Du Bois may have withheld the lyrics to mark a barrier for the reader, to suggest that black culture—life \"within the veil\"—remains inaccessible to white people.\nIn \"The Forethought\", Du Bois states: \"Leaving, then, the world of the white man, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may view faintly its deeper recesses,—the meaning of its religion, the passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls.\"  He concludes with the words: \"...need I add that I who speak here am bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil?\" \n\n\n=== \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings\" ===\nChapter I, \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings\", lays out an overview of Du Bois's thesis. He says that the blacks of the South need the right to vote, the right to a good education, and to be treated with equality and justice. Here, he also coined \"double-consciousness\", defined as a \"sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.\"\n\nOne ever feels his twoness,—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.  The History of the American Negro is the history of this strive-this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self.  He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face.\nThe first chapter also introduces Du Bois's famous metaphor of the veil. According to Du Bois, this veil is worn by all African-Americans because their view of the world and its potential economic, political, and social opportunities is so vastly different from those of white people. The veil is a visual manifestation of the color line, a problem Du Bois worked his whole life to remedy. Du Bois sublimates the function of the veil when he refers to it as a gift of second sight for African Americans, thus simultaneously characterizing the veil as both a blessing and a curse.\n\nIn those sombre forests of his striving his own soul rose before him, and he saw himself,—darkly as through a veil; and yet he saw in himself some faint revelation of his power, of his mission.\n\n\n=== \"Of the Dawn of Freedom\" ===\nThe second chapter, \"Of the Dawn of Freedom\", covers the period of history from 1861 to 1872 and the Freedmen's Bureau.  Du Bois also introduces the problem of the color-line: \"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line,—the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea.\nDu Bois describes the Freedmen's Bureau as \"one of the most singular and interesting of the attempts made by a great nation to grapple with vast problems of race and social condition.\" He quotes that the bureau was called \"one of the great landmarks of political and social progress.\" After a year's work, Du Bois states that \"it relieved a vast amount of physical suffering; it transported seven thousand fugitives from congested centres back to the farm; and, best of all, it inaugurated the crusade of the New England school-ma'am.\"\n\nThe greatest success of the Freedmen's Bureau lay in the planting of the free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary education among all classes in the South.\nHe gives credit to the creation of Fisk University, Clark Atlanta University, Howard University, and Hampton University and acknowledges the \"apostles of human culture\" Edmund Asa Ware, Samuel C. Armstrong, and Erastus Cravath.  He worried that the demise of the Freedman's Savings Bank, which resulted in huge losses for many freedmen of any savings, resulted in freedmen losing \"all the faith in savings\".\nFinally, he argues that \"if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the South with white votes, we certainly can with black votes.\"\n\n...the granting of the ballot to the black man was a necessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race, and the only method of compelling the South to accept the results of the war. Thus Negro suffrage ended a civil war by beginning a race feud.\n\n\n=== \"Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others\" ===\nChapters III and IV deal with education and progress. Here Du Bois argues against Booker T. Washington's idea of focusing solely on industrial education for black men. He advocates the addition of a classical education to establish leaders and educators in the black community.\nDu Bois refers to the Atlanta Compromise as the \"most notable of Mr. Washington's career.\" Du Bois claims that Washington wants black people to give up three things: political power, insistence on civil rights, and higher education. He claims these policies \"concentrate all their energies on industrial education, the accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South,\" which has led to \"1) The disenfranchisement of the Negro. 2) The legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for the Negro. 3) The steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher training of the Negro.\" By Washington focusing on \"common-school and industrial training,\" he \"depreciates institutions of higher learning,\" where \"teachers, professional men, and leaders\" are trained. In his concluding paragraph, he writes\n\nSo far as Mr. Washington preaches Thrift, Patience, and Industrial Training for the masses, we must hold up his hands and strive with him, rejoicing in his honors and glorying in the strength of this Joshua called of God and of man to lead the headless host. But so far as Mr. Washington apologizes for injustice, North or South, does not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting, opposes the higher training and ambition of our brighter minds,—so far as he, the South, or the Nation, does this,—we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them.\n\nNote: By the time Du Bois published his book, most of the former Confederate states had completed disenfranchisement of blacks, led by Mississippi in 1890, by constitutional amendments and other laws raising barriers to voter registration, primarily through poll taxes, residency and recordkeeping requirements, subjective literacy tests and other devices. Virginia passed similar laws in 1908. By excluding blacks from political life, southern legislatures were able to pass Jim Crow laws and other discriminatory methods.\n\n\n=== \"Of the Meaning of Progress\" ===\nIn the fourth chapter, \"Of the Meaning of Progress\", Du Bois explores his experiences first, when he was teaching in Tennessee.\n\nI was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men thought that Tennessee—beyond the Veil—was theirs alone, and in vacation time they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county school-commissioners.\n\nYet, he states, after meeting with the commissioner, \"but even then fell the awful shadow of the Veil, for they ate first, then I—alone.\"\n\nI have called my tiny community a world, and so its isolation made it; and yet there was among us but a half-awakened common consciousness, sprung from common joy and grief, at burial, birth, or wedding; from a common hardship in poverty, poor land, and low wages; and, above all, from the sight of the Veil that hung between us and Opportunity.\n\nHe returned after 10 years and found the town where he had worked had suffered many unpleasant changes. He says: \"My log schoolhouse was gone. In its place stood Progress; and Progress, I understand, is necessarily ugly.\"\n\n\n=== \"Of the Wings of Atalanta\" ===\nThe fifth chapter is a meditation on the necessity of widespread higher education in the South.\nDu Bois compares Atlanta, the City of a Hundred Hills, to the mythic Atalanta, and warns against the \"greed of gold,\" or \"interpreting the world in dollars.\"  The \"Black World beyond the Veil\", should not sacrifice \"Truth, Beauty, and Goodness\" for the ideal of wealth attainment in public schools.\n\n...beyond the Veil are smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and the led, of serfdom, of poverty, of order and subordination, and, through all, the Veil of Race.\nHe admonishes readers to \"Teach workers to work,\" and \"teach thinkers to think.\" \"The need of the South is knowledge and culture,\" he says: \"And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living,—not sordid money-getting, not apples of gold.\"\n\n\n=== \"Of the Training of Black Men\" ===\nDu Bois discusses how \"to solve the problem of training men for life,\" especially as it relates to the Negro, who \"hang between them and a light a veil so thick, that they shall not even think of breaking through.\" Du Bois cites the progress of Southern education, consisting of army schools, mission schools, and schools of the Freedman's Bureau, from the end of the Civil War until 1876. Then complete school systems were established including Normal schools and colleges, followed by the industrial revolution in the South from 1885 to 1895, and its industrial schools.  Yet, he asks, \"Is not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment?\"\nDu Bois asserts: \"...education that encourages aspiration, that sets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character rather than bread-winning,\" is the right of the black as well as the white. He goes on to state, \"If the Negro was to learn, he must teach himself,\" and cites the 30,000 black teachers created in one generation who \"wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of the black people of the land, and they made Tuskegee possible.\" \nAdditionally, 2500 Negroes had received a bachelor's degree, of whom 53% became teachers or leaders of educational systems, 17% became clergymen, 17% mainly physicians, 6% merchants, farmers and artisans; and 4% in government service. From 1875 to 1880, there were 22 Negro graduates from Northern colleges and 143 from Southern Negro colleges.  From 1895 to 1900, Northern colleges graduated 100 Negros and over 500 graduated from Southern Negro colleges. Du Bois concludes by stating that the \"...inevitable problems of civilization the Negro must meet and solve largely for himself.\"\n\nThe function of the Negro college, then, is clear: it must maintain the standards of popular education, it must seek the social regeneration of the Negro, and it must help in the solution of problems of race contact and co-operation.  And finally, beyond all this, it must develop men.\n\n\n=== \"Of the Black Belt\" ===\nDu Bois calls Albany, Georgia, in Dougherty County, the \"heart of the Black Belt.\" He says: \"Here are the remnants of the vast plantations.\"\n\nHow curious a land is this,—how full of untold story, of tragedy and laughter, and the rich legacy of human life; shadowed with a tragic past, and big with future promise!\nYet, he notes, it is not far from \"where Sam Hose was crucified\" [in a lynching], \"to-day the centre of the Negro problem,—the centre of those nine million men who are America's dark heritage from slavery and the slave-trade.\" He continues: \"Careless ignorance and laziness here, fierce hate and vindictiveness there,—these are the extremes of the Negro problem which we met that day, and we scarce knew which we preferred.\"\n\n\n=== \"Of the Quest of the Golden Fleece\" ===\nSpeaking of the cotton fields from \"Carolina to Texas\", Du Bois claims an analogy between the \"ancient and modern \"Quest of the Golden Fleece in the Black Sea.\" Continuing his discussion of Dougherty County, he explains that of the 1500 Negro families around Albany in 1898, many families have 8–10 individuals in one- or two-room homes. These families are plagued with \"easy marriage and easy separation,\" a vestige of slavery, which the Negro church has done much to prevent \"a broken household.\" He claims that most of the black population is \"poor and ignorant,\" more than 80 percent, though \"fairly honest and well meaning.\" \"Two-thirds of them cannot read or write,\" and \"over eighty-eight percent of them—men, women and children—are farmers.\"\nEconomically, the Negro has become a slave of debt, says Du Bois. He describes the economic classes: the \"submerged tenth\" of croppers, 40 percent are metayers or \"tenant on shares\" with a chattel mortgage, 39 percent are semi-metayers and wage-laborers, while 5 percent are money-renters, and 6 percent freeholders. Finally, du Bois states that only 6 percent \"have succeeded in emerging into peasant proprietorship\", leading to a \"migration to town\", the \"buying of small homesteads near town.\"\n\n\n=== \"Of the Sons of Master and Man\" ===\nThis chapter discusses \"race-contact,\" specifically as it relates to physical proximity, economic and political relations, intellectual contact, social contact, and religious enterprise. As for physical proximity, Du Bois states there is an obvious \"physical color-line\" in Southern communities separating whites from Negroes, and a Black Belt in larger areas of the country. \nHe says that here is a need for \"Negro leaders of character and intelligence\" to help guide Negro communities along the path out of the current economic situation. The power of the ballot is necessary, he asserts, as \"in every state the best arbiters of their own welfare are the persons directly affected.\" He says that \"the police system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves,\" and Negroes viewed its \"courts as a means of reenslaving the blacks.\" Regarding social contact, Du Bois states \"there is almost no community of intellectual life or point of transference where the thoughts and feelings of one race can come into direct contact and sympathy with thoughts and feelings of the other.\" \nHe concludes that \"the future of the South depends on the ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and appreciate and sympathize with each other's position.\"\n\n\n=== \"Of the Faith of the Fathers\" ===\nIn Chapter X, Du Bois describes the rise of the black church and examines the history and contemporary state of religion and spiritualism among African Americans.\nAfter recounting his first exposure to the Southern Negro revival, Du Bois notes three things that characterize this religion: \"the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy\" with the last meaning: \"the Frenzy or \"Shouting,\" when the Spirit of the Lord passed by, and, seizing the devotee, made him mad with supernatural joy.\" Du Bois says that the Negro church is the social center of Negro life and that Negro churches were predominately Methodist or Baptist after Emancipation. When Emancipation finally came, Du Bois states, \"it seemed to the freedman a literal Coming of the Lord.\"\n\n\n=== \"Of the Passing of the First-Born\" ===\nThe final chapters of the book are devoted to narratives of individuals. In Chapter XI, \"Of the Passing of the First-Born\", Du Bois recounts the birth of his first child, a son, and his untimely death as an infant. His son, Burghardt, contracted diphtheria and white doctors in Atlanta refused to treat black patients.\nDu Bois comments, \"Why was his hair tinted with gold? An evil omen was golden hair in my life.\" He says, \"I saw his breath beat quicker and quicker, pause, and then his little soul leapt like a star that travels in the night and left a world of darkness in its train.\"\nDu Bois ends with, \"Sleep, then, child,—sleep till I sleep and waken to a baby voice and the ceaseless patter of little feet—above the Veil.\"\n\n\n=== \"Of Alexander Crummell\" ===\nIn this chapter, Du Bois recounts a short biography of Alexander Crummell, an early black priest in the Episcopal Church.\nDu Bois starts with, \"this is the history of a human heart.\" He notes that Crummell faced three temptations: those of \"Hate,\" \"Despair,\" and \"Doubt,\" while crossing two vales, \"the Valley of Humiliation and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.\"\nDu Bois ends with, \"and now that he is gone, I sweep the Veil away and cry, Lo! the soul to whose dear memory I bring this little tribute.\"\n\n\n=== \"Of the Coming of John\" ===\nThe penultimate chapter of The Souls of Black Folk, \"Of the Coming of John\", \"reads like a short story, [but] Du Bois clearly considered it an essay.\" (See footnote to this essay in The Best American Essays of the Century, edited by Joyce Carol Oates; Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000). \nThe chapter describes two young men, both named John, one Black (John Jones) and the other white (John Henderson, the son of the wealthy and powerful Judge Henderson). Both Johns grow up in Altamaha, Georgia, where they were playmates in their youth. Both leave to go off to college, and both the white and Black communities in Altamaha anticipate their returns, saying: \"When John comes.\"\nThe story describes John Jones's time at college and his time in the north before returning home, including crossing paths with John Henderson at a performance of the opera Lohengrin in New York City, where John Henderson requests an usher to remove John Jones from the audience.\nWhen John Jones returns to his hometown, transformed by his time away, now a serious man with a deep understanding of the world, including the injustice of racism and of Jim Crow, he finds himself at odds with both Black and white. He speaks at his church, but what he says falls flat: \"[l]ittle had they understood of what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue.\" He convinces Judge Henderson to let him become a teacher at the Black school, and is warned to keep his place and to not stir up trouble. The Judge makes his opinions clear: \"in this country the Negro must remain subordinate, and can never expect to be the equal of white men. In their place, your people can be honest and respectful; and God knows, I'll do what I can to help them. But when they want to reverse nature, and rule white men, and marry white women, and sit in my parlor, then, by God! we'll hold them under if we have to lynch every N-- in the land.\"\nJohn Jones says he accepts the situation and is allowed to teach. It's hard work, but he makes some headway. Some time passes. One day, word gets back to the Judge that John Jones is \"livenin' things up at the darky school.\" While Judge Henderson storms off to shut down the school, his son, John Henderson, grows bored and leaves his home and finds John Jones's sister. She is young and beautiful, and John Henderson is bored. He demands a kiss; she runs. He pursues her. John Jones, walking home from the school, which Judge Henderson has just closed, comes upon John Henderson accosting his sister. John Jones picks up a branch and defends his sister, killing John Henderson. \nIn the final paragraphs, a lynch mob on horseback approaches with the Judge in front, for whom John Jones is filled with pity. Knowing what is ahead, John Jones \"softly hum[s] the 'Song of the Bride'\" in German.\n\n\n=== \"The Sorrow Songs\" ===\nChapter XIV, \"The Sorrow songs\", is about Negro music. He refers to the short musical passages at the beginning of each of the other chapters. Du Bois mentions that the music was so powerful and meaningful that, regardless of the people's appearance and teaching, \"their hearts were human and their singing stirred men with a mighty power.\"  Du Bois concludes the chapter by bringing up inequality, race and discrimination. He says, \"Your country? How came it yours? Before the Pilgrims landed we were here\".\nDu Bois heralds the \"melody of the slave songs,\" or the Negro spirituals, as the \"articulate message of the slave to the world.\" They are the music, he contends, not of the joyous black slave, as a good many whites had misread them, but \"of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment; they tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer world, of misty wanderings and hidden ways.\" For Du Bois, the sorrow songs represented a black folk culture—with its origins in slavery—unadulterated by the civilizing impulses of a northern black church, increasingly obsessed with respectability and with Western aesthetic criteria. Rather than vestiges of a backward time that should be purged from black repertoires and isolated from what Alain Locke called the \"modernization of the negro\" (coincident, for Locke, with urbanization), negro spirituals are—for Du Bois—where the souls of black folk past and present are found.\nDu Bois passionately advocated for the preservation of the spiritual, along with Antonín Dvořák and contemporary black aestheticians, including Harry Burleigh, Robert Nathaniel Dett, Alain Locke and Zora Neale Hurston. It is in the retrieval of black cultural folkways—particularly \"The Sorrow Songs\"—that one of the major complications of Du Bois's project and, later, the Harlem Renaissance (where Hurston and Locke debut their own retrievals) surfaces. For Du Bois's contention that the sorrow songs contain a notative excess, and untranscribable element Yolanda Pierce identifies as the \"soul\" of the sorrow songs. The mappings of sound and signs that make up the languages of white Western culture would prove insufficient to many black literary critics of the 1920s and beyond, and the debates over the abilities to retrieve and preserve black folkways find their roots in Du Bois's treatment of the sorrow songs and in his call for their rescue.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn Living Black History, Du Bois's biographer Manning Marable observes:\n\nFew books make history and fewer still become foundational texts for the movements and struggles of an entire people. The Souls of Black Folk occupies this rare position. It helped to create the intellectual argument for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century. \"Souls\" justified the pursuit of higher education for Negroes and thus contributed to the rise of the black middle class. By describing a global color-line, Du Bois anticipated pan-Africanism and colonial revolutions in the Third World. Moreover, this stunning critique of how 'race' is lived through the normal aspects of daily life is central to what would become known as 'whiteness studies' a century later.\nAt the time of its publication, the Nashville Banner warned of The Souls of Black Folk, \"This book is dangerous for the Negro to read, for it will only incite discontent and fill his imagination with things that do not exist, or things that should not bear upon his mind.\" The New York Times said, \"A review of [the work of the Freedmen's Bureau] from the negro point of view, even the Northern negro's point of view, must have its value to any unprejudiced student—still more, perhaps, for the prejudiced who is yet willing to be a student.\"\nIn his introduction to the 1961 edition, writer Saunders Redding observed: \"The boycott of the buses in Montgomery had many roots . . . but none more important than this little book of essays published more than half a century ago.\"\n\n\n=== Literary reception ===\nAs Yale professor Hazel Carby points out, for black writers before the abolition of slavery in 1865, it was impossible \"even to imagine the option of returning to the South once black humanity and freedom had been gained in the North\", and it was rarely found in later literature as well. While the narratives of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Ann Jacobs move towards the North and freedom, Du Bois reverses \"the direction of the archetypal journey of these original narratives\" and focuses on the Black Belt of the South. Although the text \"consistently shifts between a predominantly white and a predominantly black world\", in line with Du Bois's concept of double consciousness, \"its overall narrative impulse gradually moves the focus from a white terrain to an autonomous black one.\"\nCarby traces the ways in which Du Bois gendered his narrative of black folk, but also how Du Bois's conceptual framework is gendered as well. According to Carby, it seems that Du Bois in this book is most concerned with how race and nation intersect, and how such an intersection is based on particular masculine notions of progress. According to Carby, Du Bois \"exposes and exploits the tension that exists between the internal egalitarianism of the nation and the relations of domination and subordination embodied in a racially encoded social hierarchy.\" So Du Bois makes a conceptual argument that racialization is actually compatible with the nation in so far as it creates unified races. However, this unified race is only possible through the gendered narrative that he constructs throughout Souls, which renders black male intellectuals (himself) as the (only possible) leader(s) of the unified race. Carby explains that \"in order to retain his credentials for leadership, Du Bois had to situate himself as both an exceptional and a representative individual.... The terms and conditions of his exceptionalism, Du Bois argues, have their source in his formation as a gendered intellectual.\" According to Carby, Du Bois was concerned with \"the reproduction of Race Men\". In other words, \"the figure of the intellectual and race leader is born of and engendered by other males.\" \nSuch a reading of Du Bois calls attention to \"queer meanings\" that, according to Charles Nero, are inherent in Souls. Nero, who uses Anne Herrmann's definition of queer, conceptualizes queerness as the \"recognition on the part of others that one is not like others, a subject out of order, not in sequence, not working.\" Foundational to Nero's argument is the understanding that men have the authority to exchange women among one another in order to form a \"homosocial contract\". Nero analyzes Du Bois's discussion on the Teutonic and Submissive Man to conclude that such a contract would lead to a \"round and full development\" to produce a \"great civilization\". However, Nero is concerned with violence and the \"rigid policing of sexual identity categories at the turn of the century\", which ultimately made such a homosocial, biracial contract impossible.\nIn Charles I. Nero's \"Queering the Souls of Black Folk\", Nero marks \"Of the Coming of John\" as a central chapter that demonstrates his queer reading of Souls. Nero argues that John Jones's absence of masculinity is a sign of his queerness and that the killing of his \"double\" represents Du Bois's disillusionment with the idea that a biracial and homosocial society can exist.  Nero contends that Du Bois's illustration of the gulf between the two Johns is complicated by the impossibility of biracial male union, which suggests that John's acculturation in the metropole (Johnstown in Du Bois's narrative)—alongside lessons in Victorian comportment and a \"queer\" intellectualism—is also an ideological induction into male sexual panic, or the hegemony of a racializing gender order at the turn of the twentieth century. Nero's interpretation of Jennie's assault (and her subsequent disappearance from the text) chafes against earlier interpretations that allege John Jones's murder of John Henderson as indebted to a tradition of white southern chivalry. Instead, Nero marshals Signithia Fordham's terminology of \"gender integrity\" to delimit how the murder of John Henderson resolves the challenge to John Jones's masculinity, going on to point out that \"Du Bois [is] writing about race… [and] against a culture that turns him queer by excluding him from public heterosexuality\" (Nero 271).\n\n\n=== Cultural and religious criticism ===\nDu Bois had transdisciplinary training and he provided a historical context for black religion and culture. His concept of \"double-consciousness\" and other concepts from Souls have been highly influential on other scholars in their interpretations of black culture and religion. Cheryl Sanders, a professor of Christian ethics at Howard University School of Divinity, lists a \"who's who\" of Du Bois progeny in her scholarly work, including Paul Gilroy, C. Eric Lincoln, Lawrence Mamiya, Peter Paris, Emilie Townes, and Cornel West. These are some of the scholars who take up themes or concepts found in Souls for their own work in religious and theological studies or cultural criticism. Additionally, Victor Anderson, a philosophical theologian and cultural critic at Vanderbilt University Divinity School and the author of Beyond Ontological Blackness: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism, links concepts from Souls to much of the work in black religious studies.\nIn Beyond Ontological Blackness, Victor Anderson seeks to critique a trope of \"black heroic genius\" articulated within the logics of ontological blackness as a philosophy of racial consciousness. At the center of this conception is Du Bois.\nAnderson says,\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois's double-consciousness depiction of black existence has come to epitomize the existential determinants of black self-consciousness. These alienated forms of black consciousness have been categorically defined in African-American cultural studies as: The Negro Problem, The Color Line, Black Experience, Black Power, The Veil of Blackness, Black Radicalism, and most recently, The Black Sacred Cosmos.Anderson's critique of black heroic genius and a move towards black cultural fulfillment is an attempt to move beyond the categories deployed by Du Bois in Souls.\nSimilarly, Sanders critiques Du Bois's concept of double-consciousness, especially in terms of interpreting black holiness-Pentecostalism. In Sanders's work, Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture, Sanders deploys a dialectical understanding of exile, which she characterizes in black holiness-Pentecostal terms as \"Being in the world, but not of it.\" At the same time, Sanders wishes to contrast this to the double-consciousness dialect of Du Bois, at least as she understands it. For Sanders, \"exilic dialectics\" is \"hoped to represent a progressive step beyond the 'double-consciousness' described by W. E. B. Du Bois in 1903, which persists as the dominant paradigm in African American religious and cultural thought.\"\nDescribing exilic consciousness as between \"both-and\", and double-consciousness as \"either-or\", Sanders says that those who live in exile \"can find equilibrium and fulfillment between extremes, whereas adherents to the latter either demand resolution or suffer greatly in the tension, as is the case with Du Bois's description of the agony of 'double-consciousness,' as 'two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.'\"\n\n\n=== International reception ===\nThe Souls of Black Folk had significant influence in China. The Chinese translation was based on the 1953 Blue Heron edition, which had removed arguably anti-Semitic references from the original text. People's Daily praised the book extensively, although it also had some mild criticism, and recommended that Chinese read it to understand how racial discrimination has oppressed Black Americans. \nDu Bois' account of the loss of his son was particularly well-regarded in China and was published as a separate pamphlet by Commercial Press the year after the book as a whole was published in Chinese.\n\n\n== Textual changes ==\nIn 1953, The Souls of Black Folk was published in a special \"Fiftieth Anniversary Jubilee Edition\". In his introduction, Du Bois wrote that in the 50 years since its publication, he occasionally had the inclination to revise the book but ultimately decided to leave it as it was, \"as a monument to what I thought and felt in 1903\". While he stuck by his decision, he wrote that in the new edition he had made \"less than a half-dozen alterations in word or phrase and then not to change my thoughts as previously set down but to avoid any possible misunderstanding today of what I meant to say yesterday.\" \nIn 1973, historian Herbert Aptheker identified seven changes between the editions. Historian and literary critic Henry Louis Gates Jr. and a team of readers performed a line-by-line comparison of the two editions during the 1980s and identified two more changes. All the changes are minor; the longest was to change \"nephews and poor whites and the Jews\" to \"poor relations and foreign immigrants\". In six of the nine changes, Du Bois changed references to Jews to refer to immigrants or foreigners. Two of the other changes also involved references to Jews.\nDu Bois wrote to Aptheker in February 1953 about concerns he had with his references to Jews in the book:\n\nI have had a chance to read [The Souls of Black Folk] in part for the first time in years. I find in chapters VII, VIII and IX, five incidental references to Jews. I recall that years ago, Jacob Schiff wrote me criticising these references and that I denied any thought of race or religious prejudice and promised to go over the passages in future editions. These editions succeeded each other without any consultation with me, and evidently the matter slipped out of my mind.As I re-read these words today, I see that harm might come if they were allowed to stand as they are. First of all, I am not at all sure that the foreign exploiters to whom I referred ... were in fact Jews.... But even if they were, what I was condemning was the exploitation and not the race nor religion. And I did not, when writing, realize that by stressing the name of the group instead of what some members of the [group] may have done, I was unjustly maligning a people in exactly the same way my folk were then and are now falsely accused.In view of this and because of the even greater danger of injustice now than then, I want in the event of re-publication [to] change those passages.\nIn a March 1953 letter to Blue Heron Press, Du Bois asked that the following paragraph be added to the end of \"Of the Black Belt\":\n\nIn the foregoing chapter, \"Jews\" have been mentioned five times, and the late Jacob Schiff once complained that this gave an impression of anti-Semitism. This at the time I stoutly denied; but as I read the passages again in the light of subsequent history, I see how I laid myself open to this possible misapprehension. What, of course, I meant to condemn was the exploitation of black labor and that it was in this country and at that time in part a matter of immigrant Jews, was incidental and not essential. My inner sympathy with the Jewish people was expressed better in the last paragraph of page 152. But this illustrates how easily one slips into unconscious condemnation of a whole group.\nThe publisher did not add the paragraph, possibly because Du Bois changed the text instead.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAberjhani (ed.), The Wisdom of W.

In his essays, Baldwin's purpose was to reach a mass white audience and help them to better understand Black Americans' struggle for equal rights. Looking at the time period in which Baldwin's essays were published shows how purposefully each essay was constructed. At the time, the Civil Rights Movement was beginning to recognize the need for publicity, in particular \"story-telling that would generate public support for the movement's people and goals\". This was the context in which Baldwin's essays were first published.\nWhat made Baldwin's essays effective is that they were testimonial. Giving testimonial evidence about how racism in America has operated in real people's lives is an effective strategy for connecting with an audience that is otherwise unaware. The book met both the need of the Civil Rights Movement for publicity and an unspoken need of white audiences who did not understand the movement or the lives of the people involved. Although many of the ideas that Baldwin writes about in his essays were not novel to black intellectualism, the way in which they were presented to their audience was. Baldwin's writings profoundly \"provoked and challenged the dominant white American frame for understanding race relations\" during the time that they were first published.\n\n\n=== \"My Dungeon Shook\" ===\nThe first essay, originally appearing in The Progressive magazine in 1962 and titled \"My Dungeon Shook: Letter to My Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Emancipation\", is a letter to Baldwin's nephew in which he compares his nephew to the men in their family including Baldwin's brother and father. He tells his nephew about America's ability to destroy Black men and challenges his nephew to convert his anger due to mistreatment as a Black man into having a passionate and broad outlook on the African-American experience.\n\n\n=== \"Down at the Cross: Letter from a Region in my Mind\" ===\nThe second essay originally appeared in The New Yorker (1962) under the title \"Letter from a Region in My Mind\".\nTitled in the book as \"Down at the Cross: Letter from a Region in my Mind\", the essay addresses the detriment of Christianity on the Black community and Baldwin's journey from being a teen pastor to completely pulling away from the church because it felt like a repression of his full experience of humanity. He then recounts his dinner with Elijah Muhammad where Muhammad educated Baldwin on the Nation of Islam in the hope of getting him to join the movement. In this section Baldwin describes how Black Muslims have made a \"black god\" to avoid the oppression of a \"white god\" that Christianity has established within the Black community.\n\n\n== Responses ==\nJacquelyn Dowd Hall wrote an article that focused on the civil rights movement, led by Martin Luther King Jr., building on Baldwin's work. Baldwin's piece examined the issue of racism mainly in his area of Harlem, New York, and Hall emphasized that the racial issue they confronted in America was not a sectional but a national problem.\nAnother article that expands on Baldwin's new religious view was written by Jon Nilson, a theology professor. In The Fire Next Time, Baldwin focused on how Christianity was corrupted. Observing that Baldwin challenged the Catholic Church, Nilson said that the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. had almost seemed like The Fire Next Time had come true.\nIn December 2016, Can I Get a Witness? The Gospel of James Baldwin, a 2016 musical theatrical tribute to Baldwin by the musician Meshell Ndegeocello and based on The Fire Next Time was premiered at the Harlem Stage in Harlem.\nIn July 2015, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote an article in The Atlantic as an updated version of Baldwin's letter to his nephew called \"Letter to My Son\", and later published an entire book called Between the World and Me that talks about the modern Black experience in America.\nThe title was alluded to in Max Hastings' book America, 1968: The Fire This Time.\nIt was also alluded to in The Fire This Time (anthology), edited by Jesmyn Ward.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nAccording to Pen America, the Fire Next Time has recently been either banned or challenged in certain school districts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJames Baldwin: A Soul on Fire\nThe New Jim Crow\nBetween the World and Me\nTimeline of the civil rights movement\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAdalet, Begüm (2024). \"An Insurgent Mood: Lorraine Hansberry on the Politics of Home\".

    "full_narrative": "Notes of a Native Son is a book of ten essays written by James Baldwin, first published in 1955. It was his debut nonfiction book, and it explores deep and personal themes, especially focusing on race, identity, and the Black experience in both America and Europe.\nThe volume, as his first non-fiction book, compiles essays of Baldwin that had previously appeared in such magazines as Harper's Magazine, Partisan Review, and The New Leader.\nNotes of a Native Son is widely regarded as a classic of the autobiographical genre. The Modern Library placed it at number 19 on its list of the 100 best 20th-century nonfiction books.\n\n\n== Autobiographical notes ==\nJames Baldwin was born into poverty, on August 2, 1924. Growing up, Baldwin found refuge in reading books at the public library and began writing poems, short stories, and plays at a young age. Although Baldwin's father encouraged him to pursue a career as a preacher, Baldwin identified more strongly with writing. His formative experiences in the church influenced both his worldview and the rhetorical style of his writing, particularly through the use of voice, rhythm, and moral inquiry. Baldwin later reflected on how preaching informed his literary expression, even as he moved away from organized religion.\nAs Baldwin developed his identity as a writer, he confronted the challenges of working within a literary tradition shaped by European and American cultural influences. He was critical of certain portrayals of Black life in American literature, including those by fellow African American writers. In particular, he disagreed with Richard Wright's depiction of the character Bigger Thomas in Native Son, arguing that the portrayal risked reinforcing limiting stereotypes. This debate highlighted Baldwin's focus on conveying the emotional and psychological complexities of Black identity.\nIn the late 1940s, Baldwin moved to Paris. His decision to live abroad was, in part, motivated by a desire to gain a critical distance from American racial dynamics. While living in France and elsewhere in Europe, Baldwin continued to engage with American social and political issues through his writing. His essays often explored the intersection of race, identity, and personal experience, reflecting a commitment to both literary craft and moral clarity.\nThroughout his career, Baldwin expressed a desire to be both an honest writer and a principled individual, a goal reflected in much of his nonfiction work, including Notes of a Native Son.\n\n\n== Part One ==\n\n\n=== \"Everybody's Protest Novel\" ===\nBaldwin criticizes Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin for being too overly emotional and for showing black slaves as looking to a \"White God\" to be saved and made pure. He believed this kind of emotional approach also appears in modern protest literature. Although he understands the good intentions behind these works, he argues that they fail to show the full complexity of Black Life and may even reinforce harmful stereotypes. He also disagrees with how Richard Wright's Native Son presents the character Bigger Thomas as an angry Black man, seeing it as a limiting and harmful portrayal for black men.\n\n\n=== \"Many Thousands Gone\" ===\nIn Many Thousands Gone, James Baldwin examines how Black identity has been misrepresented in American culture, particularly through literature and dominant social perspectives. Focusing on Richard Wright’s Native Son and its protagonist, Bigger Thomas – a young black man who commits acts of violence – Baldwin critiques both the construction of the character and public reactions to him. He argues that Bigger functions more as a symbol shaped by societal fear and racism than as a fully developed individual. While acknowledging the significance of Wright’s work, Baldwin questions its emphasis on anger and violence as a means of expressing Black experience, suggesting it may unintentionally reinforce negative stereotypes. More broadly, Baldwin critiques the tendency of American society to project guilt and fear onto Black individuals rather than recognizing their full humanity. He calls for literature that portrays the complexity of Black life beyond protest narratives and simplistic representations.\n\n\n=== \"Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough\" ===\nIn his essay Carmen Jones: The Dark is Light Enough, included in Notes of a Native Son (1955), James Baldwin critiques the 1954 film Carmen Jones, which featured Dorothy Dandridge and an all-black supporting cast. While the film was praised for its representation, Baldwin argues that it fails to reflect the realities of Black life. He criticizes the characters as lacking authenticity, with sanitized speech and settings that cater to white expectations. Baldwin also notes the prominence of light-skinned actors in leading roles, suggesting that colorism influenced casting decisions. He contends that the film projects white American fantasies onto Black characters rather than offering a meaningful portrayal of Black identity.\n\n\n== Part Two ==\n\n\n=== \"The Harlem Ghetto\" ===\nBaldwin points to the very high rent in Harlem. Moreover, although there are black politicians, the President is white. On the black press, Baldwin notes that it emulates the white press, with its scandalous spreads. However the black Church seems to him to be a unique forum for the spelling out of black injustice. Finally, he ponders on antisemitism amongst blacks and comes to the conclusion that the frustration boils down to Jews being white, and more powerful than Negroes.\n\n\n=== \"Journey to Atlanta\" ===\nBaldwin tells the story that happened to The Melodeers, a group of jazz singers (including two of Baldwin's brothers) employed by the Progressive Party to sing in Southern Churches. However, once in Atlanta, Georgia, they were used for canvassing until they refused to sing at all and were returned to their hometown. Baldwin concludes the section by writing that the Melodeers were “not particularly bitter toward the Progressive Party, though they can scarcely be numbered among its supporters.”\n\n\n=== \"Notes of a Native Son\" ===\nBaldwin paints a vivid recollection of his time growing up with a paranoid father who was dying of tuberculosis, and his initial experience with Jim Crow style segregation. Prior to his father's death, Baldwin was befriended by a white teacher whom his father disapproved of. Later he worked in New Jersey and was often turned down in segregated places—Baldwin recalls a time he hurled a cup half full of water at a waitress in a diner only to realize his actions could have dire consequences. He goes on to say that blacks participating in military service in the South often got abused. Finally, he recounts his father's death which occurred just before his mother gave birth to one of his sisters; his father's funeral was on his 19th birthday, the same day as the Harlem riot of 1943.\n\n\n== Part Three ==\n\n\n=== \"Encounter on the Seine: Black Meets Brown\" ===\nBaldwin draws a comparison between Black Americans and Black individuals living in France. He observes that while Black people in France often have a distinct cultural heritage and a country of origin to identify with, Black Americans do not share this connection. Instead, their roots are deeply tied to the United States, a nation that has historically marginalized them. Baldwin argues that the history of Black Americans is not something inherited from another land but is being shaped within the United States itself. This ongoing struggle for identity and belonging is central to the Black American experience, highlighting the unique challenges of forging a cultural and historical identity in a country that has long denied their full humanity.\n\n\n=== \"A Question of Identity\" ===\nBaldwin discusses the experiences of American students living in Paris. He observes that many arrive feeling excited but soon become confused by the cultural differences and want to return home. Baldwin uses this to explore how being in a new country can make people reflect on who they are. For Black Americans, he notes that living in Europe can feel freeing because the racial tensions are different from those in the U.S., but it also brings new challenges. The essay shows how identity is shaped by both personal background and environment, and how living abroad can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself.\n\n\n=== \"Equal in Paris\" ===\nBaldwin recounts being arrested in Paris during the Christmas season of 1949. The arrest occurred after an acquaintance stole a bedsheet from a hotel, which Baldwin unknowingly used. Despite his innocence, he was detained in a French jail, an experience that left a lasting impression on him. Baldwin reflects on his confusion and fear during the ordeal, highlighting his lack of understanding about how to deal with the police in a foreign country. The essay explores themes of vulnerability, alienation, and the cultural disorientation that can come with living abroad. It also illustrates Baldwin's growing awareness of how identity, race, and nationality can influence one's treatment by authority figures, even outside the United States.\n\n\n=== \"Stranger in the Village\" ===\n\nBaldwin recalls his time living in a small village in Switzerland, where he was the first Black person the villagers had ever seen. He reflects on the curiosity and naivety with which he was treated, noting how his presence highlighted the villagers' limited exposure to racial diversity. Baldwin contrasts this with the situation in the United States, where Black people have long been an integral part of the nation's history and culture. He observes that, unlike Europe where most Black populations were still largely tied to the colonies in Africa-America's identity has been deeply shaped by the presence and contributions of Black Americans. The essay explores themes of visibility, cultural difference, and the ways in which race is understood in different parts of the world.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\n\n=== Introduction ===\nJames Baldwin's Notes of a Native Son (1955) is a collection of ten essays that mix personal stories with reflections on race in America. Over time, it has become a classic in both American nonfiction and African American literature. The way people have responded to the book has changed over the year-from early reviews in the 1950s to more recent analysis by scholars and critics. This summary explores how the book had been viewed throughout the decades, including opinions from major reviewers and important literary voices to give a clear picture of its lasting impact.\n\n\n=== Publication and initial reception (1950s) ===\nNotes of a Native son was first published in 1955 by Beacon Press. Upon release, it initially garnered modest attention and sales - the first edition \"did not sell well\" - but a 1957 paperback reissue (following Baldwin's novel Giovanni's Room) brought the book wider readership, \"outstanding reviews and brisk sales\". Early critical commentary in the mid-1950s was very positive. Time Magazine praised Baldwin's voice in the collection as \"written with bitter clarity and uncommon grace\", signaling the book's forthright yet eloquent style. Kirkus Reviews, in 1955 notice, lauded the essay's as a \"compelling unit\" of analysis on the \"Negro experience\" and applauded Baldwin's blend of poetic drama and social insight. The Kirkus Review highlighted Baldwin's range from critiques of protest literature to personal reflection, and deemed it \"Exceptional writing.\"\n Though it took a few years to attract mainstream notice, by 1958 the collection received a high-profile in the New York Times Book Review from poet Langston Hughes. Hughes's review was glowing: he noted that James Baldwin \"writes down to nobody\" - in other words, Baldwin refuses to patronize or simplify - and that \"as an essayist he is thought-provoking, tantalizing, irritating, abusing and amusing. And he uses words as the sea uses waves, to flow and beat, advance and retreat\". Hughes observed that few American writers could handle the essay form more effectively than Baldwin; in Baldwin essays, \"the thought becomes poetry, and the poetry illuminates the thought\". While Hughes did point out that Baldwin's perspective was at times \"half American, half Afro-American, incompletely fused\" - suggesting the young writer was still integrating his viewpoints. The early review by literary luminary like Hughes cemented Baldwin's status as a serious new voice.\n\n\n=== Modern reassessments and lasting legacy (1980s–2020s) ===\nSince James Baldwin's death in 1987, Notes of Native Son has continued to attract critical and scholarly attention. The book is still widely read, assigned in academic settings, and often cited in discussion of twentieth-century American nonfiction and African American literature. It has been listed in The Guardian's \"100 best nonfiction books of all time,\" where critic Robert McCrum described Baldwin's essays as a \"recent classic\" and noted their \"telling language\" and exploration of Black identity in America. Scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., quoted in the same article, commented that Baldwin \"articulated for the first time to white America what it meant to be American and a black American at the same time\"\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, literary biographer James Campbell highlighted Baldwin's skill in the essay form in Talking at the Gates: A Life of James Baldwin. Campbell observed that Baldwin's writing style allowed him to develop personal themes in a discursive way and pointed to Notes of a Native Son as a significant example of Baldwin's reflective method, especially in essays that address personal experiences like the death of his father and the 1943 Harlem riot.\nThe book has also gained renewed interest in recent years, particularly in light of ongoing conversations about race and social justice in the United States. The 2017 documentary I Am Not Your Negro, based on Baldwin's writings, introduced Baldwin's ideas to new audiences and contributed to discussions about the continuing relevance of his work.\nSince its original publication in 1955, the critical reception of Notes of a Native Son has remained largely favorable. Initial reviews praised Baldwin's writing style and insight, and over time, literary figures such as Langston Hughes and Henry Louis Gates Jr. have offered positive assessments of the book's contributions to American letters. While there have been occasional dissenting perspectives, especially during politically charged periods such as the late 1960s, these have not significantly diminished the book's overall standing. Today, Notes of a Native Son is widely recognized as key work in Baldwin's career and in American nonfiction literature.\n\n\n== References ==",

The photograph was taken by Albert Watson.\nWhen the photograph was taken, he said he insisted on having a three-hour period to set up his equipment, adding that he wanted to make \"[every shoot] as greased lightning fast as possible for the [subject].\" When Jobs arrived he didn't immediately look at Watson, but instead at the equipment, focusing on Watson's 4×5 camera before saying, \"wow, you're shooting film.\"\n\nIf you look at that shot, you can see the intensity. It was my intention that by looking at him, that you knew this guy was smart. I heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time.\nJobs gave Watson an hour—longer than he had given most photographers for a portrait session. Watson reportedly instructed Jobs to make \"95 percent, almost 100 percent of eye contact with the camera,\" and to \"think about the next project you have on the table,\" in addition to thinking about instances when people have challenged him.\nThe title font is Helvetica.\n\n\n=== Back cover ===\nThe back cover uses another photographic portrait of Jobs taken in his living room in Woodside, California, in February 1984 by Norman Seeff. In a Behind the Cover article published by Time magazine, Seeff recalls him and Jobs \"just sitting\" on his living room floor, talking about \"creativity and everyday stuff,\" when Jobs left the room and returned with a Macintosh 128K (the original Macintosh computer). Jobs \"[plopped] down\" in the lotus position holding the computer in his lap when Seeff took the photograph.\n\nWe did do a few more shots later on, and he even did a few yoga poses—he lifted his leg and put it over his shoulder—and I just thought we were two guys hanging out, chatting away, and enjoying the relationship. It wasn't like there was a conceptualization here—this was completely off the cuff, spontaneity that we never thought would become an iconic image.\n\n\n=== Title ===\nThe book's working title, iSteve: The Book of Jobs, was chosen by publisher Simon & Schuster's publicity department. Although author Walter Isaacson was \"never quite sure about it\", his wife and daughter reportedly were. However, they thought it was \"too cutesy\" and as a result Isaacson persuaded the publisher to change the title to something \"simpler and more elegant.\"\nThe title Steve Jobs was allegedly chosen to reflect Jobs's \"minimalist\" style and to emphasize the biography's authenticity, further differentiating it from unauthorized publications, such as iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business by Jeffrey Young.\n\n\n=== Chapters ===\nMany of the chapters within the book have sub-headings, which are matched in various audiobook versions resulting in listings showing 150+ chapters when there are only 42 chapters. The audiobook contains a mistake on one chapter title, listing Chapter 41 as \"Round Three, A Never-ending Struggle\" instead of \"Round Three, Twilight Struggle\" as published.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJanet Maslin's review of the book for The New York Times mixed mild criticisms with praise. Maslin wrote that Isaacson's biography presented \"an encyclopedic survey of all that Mr. Jobs accomplished, replete with the passion and excitement that it deserves.\"\nA number of Steve Jobs's family and close colleagues expressed disapproval, including Laurene Powell Jobs, Tim Cook and Jony Ive. Cook remarked that the biography did Jobs \"a tremendous disservice\", and that \"it didn't capture the person. The person I read about there is somebody I would never have wanted to work with over all this time.\" Ive said of the book that \"my regard couldn't be lower.\"\nCommercially, the biography was a notable success, selling more than three million copies in the United States alone by 2015.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nSteve Jobs is a drama film based on the life of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender in the title role. The film is directed by Danny Boyle, produced by Scott Rudin, and written by Aaron Sorkin (with a screenplay adapted both from Isaacson's Steve Jobs as well as from interviews conducted by Sorkin).\n\n\n== Other media ==\nExtracts from the biography have been the feature of various magazines, in addition to interviews with the author, Walter Isaacson.\nTo memorialize Jobs's life after his death on October 5, 2011, TIME published a commemorative issue on October 8, 2011. The issue's cover featured a portrait of Jobs, taken by Norman Seeff, in which he is sitting in the lotus position holding the original Macintosh computer. The portrait was published in Rolling Stone in January 1984 and is featured on the back cover of Steve Jobs. The issue marked the eighth time Jobs has been featured on the cover of Time.\nThe issue included a photographic essay by Diana Walker, a retrospective on Apple by Harry McCracken and Lev Grossman, and a six-page essay by Walter Isaacson. Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs and described Jobs pitching the book to him.\nBloomberg Businessweek also released a commemorative issue of its magazine remembering the life of Jobs. The cover of the magazine features Apple-like simplicity, with a black-and-white, up-close photo of Jobs and his years of birth and death. In tribute to Jobs's minimalist style, the issue was published without advertisements. It featured extensive essays by Steve Jurvetson, John Sculley, Sean Wisely, William Gibson, and Walter Isaacson. Similarly to Time's commemorative issue, Isaacson's essay served as a preview of Steve Jobs.\nFortune featured an exclusive extract of the biography on October 24, 2011, focusing on the \"friend-enemy\" relationship Jobs had with Bill Gates.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nEven after a late release that year, the book became Amazon's #1 seller for 2011.\n\n2012 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award, shortlist\n2011 The New York Times bestseller\n2011 Christian Science Monitor Best Book, nonfiction\n2011 Time Magazine's Best Books of the Year\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2011 in literature\nApple Inc. development history\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPresentation by Isaacson on Steve Jobs, December 13, 2011, C-SPAN\nPresentation by Isaacson on Steve Jobs, September 22, 2012, C-SPAN\nSteve Jobs Biography - Net Worth, Family, Age (1995-2011) (archived) –  An article by \"brightbrainiac\"",

    "description": "Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum theory. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called \"the world's most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\".\nBorn in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later, which he kept for the rest of his life, and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews, he decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research, later carried out as the Manhattan Project.\nIn 1905, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers. In them, he outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. In 1917, Einstein wrote a paper which introduced the concepts of spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, the latter of which is the core mechanism behind the laser and maser, and which contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics.\nIn the middle part of his career, Einstein made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons. With physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, he laid the groundwork for Bose–Einstein statistics. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that ultimately proved unsuccessful. First, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that \"God does not play dice\". Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from mainstream modern physics.",

He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\".\nBorn in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later, which he kept for the rest of his life, and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews, he decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research, later carried out as the Manhattan Project.\nIn 1905, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers. In them, he outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity, and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. In 1917, Einstein wrote a paper which introduced the concepts of spontaneous emission and stimulated emission, the latter of which is the core mechanism behind the laser and maser, and which contained a trove of information that would be beneficial to developments in physics later on, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics.\nIn the middle part of his career, Einstein made important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons. With physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, he laid the groundwork for Bose–Einstein statistics. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that ultimately proved unsuccessful. First, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that \"God does not play dice\". Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from mainstream modern physics.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Childhood, youth and education ===\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich's borough of Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.\nWhen he was very young, his parents worried that he had a learning disability because he was very slow to learn to talk. When he was five and sick in bed, his father brought him a compass. This sparked his lifelong fascination with electromagnetism. He realized that \"Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.\"\nEinstein attended St. Peter's Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five. When he was eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education.\n\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Munich, but without success—they lacked the capital that would have been required to update their technology from direct current to the more efficient, alternating current alternative. The failure of their bid forced them to sell their Munich factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere. The Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia, where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani. Einstein, then fifteen, stayed behind in Munich in order to finish his schooling. His father wanted him to study electrical engineering, but he was a fractious pupil who found the Gymnasium's regimen and teaching methods far from congenial. He later wrote that the school's policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity. At the end of December 1894, a letter from a doctor persuaded the Luitpold's authorities to release him from its care, and he joined his family in Pavia. While in Italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay entitled \"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field\".\nEinstein excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years his senior. He began teaching himself algebra, calculus and Euclidean geometry when he was twelve; he made such rapid progress that he discovered an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem before his thirteenth birthday. A family tutor, Max Talmud, said that only a short time after he had given the twelve year old Einstein a geometry textbook, the boy \"had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics ... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow.\" Einstein recorded that he had \"mastered integral and differential calculus\" while still just fourteen. His love of algebra and geometry was so great that at twelve, he was already confident that nature could be understood as a \"mathematical structure\".\n\nAt thirteen, when his range of enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy, Talmud introduced Einstein to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher; according to Talmud, \"At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.\"\nIn 1895, at the age of sixteen, Einstein sat the entrance examination for the federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland. He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the test, but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the polytechnic's principal, he completed his secondary education at the Argovian cantonal school (a gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, graduating in 1896. While lodging in Aarau with the family of Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. (His sister, Maja, later married Winteler's son Paul.)\n\nIn January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship of the German Kingdom of Württemberg in order to avoid conscription into military service. The Matura (graduation for the successful completion of higher secondary schooling), awarded to him in September 1896, acknowledged him to have performed well across most of the curriculum, allotting him a top grade of 6 for history, physics, algebra, geometry, and descriptive geometry. At seventeen, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal polytechnic school. He befriended fellow student Marcel Grossmann, who would help him there to get by despite his loose study habits, and later to mathematically underpin his revolutionary insights into physics. Marie Winteler, a year older than him, took up a teaching post in Olsberg, Switzerland.\nThe five other polytechnic school freshmen following the same course as Einstein included just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Marić. Over the next few years, the pair spent many hours discussing their shared interests and learning about topics in physics that the polytechnic school's lectures did not cover. In his letters to Marić, Einstein confessed that exploring science with her by his side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude. Eventually the two students became not only friends but also lovers.\nHistorians of physics are divided on the question of the extent to which Marić contributed to the insights of Einstein's annus mirabilis publications. There is at least some evidence that he was influenced by her scientific ideas, but there are scholars who doubt whether her impact on his thought was of any great significance at all.\n\n\n=== Marriages, relationships and children ===\n\nCorrespondence between Einstein and Marić, discovered and published in 1987, revealed that in early 1902, while Marić was visiting her parents in Novi Sad, she gave birth to a daughter, Lieserl. When Marić returned to Switzerland it was without the child, whose fate is uncertain. A letter of Einstein's that he wrote in September 1903 suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.\nEinstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zurich in July 1910. In letters that Einstein wrote to Marie Winteler in the months before Eduard's arrival, he described his love for his wife as \"misguided\" and mourned the \"missed life\" that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler instead: \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be.\"\n\nIn 1912, Einstein entered into a relationship with Elsa Löwenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's side and his second cousin on his father's. When Marić learned of his infidelity soon after moving to Berlin with him in April 1914, she returned to Zurich, taking Hans Albert and Eduard with her. Einstein and Marić were granted a divorce on 14 February 1919 on the grounds of having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed that if he were to win a Nobel Prize, he would give the money that he received to Marić; he won the prize two years later.\nEinstein married Löwenthal in 1919. In 1923, he began a relationship with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of his close friend Hans Mühsam. Löwenthal nevertheless remained loyal to him, accompanying him when he emigrated to the United States in 1933. In 1935, she was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems. She died in December 1936.\n\nA volume of Einstein's letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006 added some other women with whom he was romantically involved. They included Margarete Lebach (a married Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom he accepted gifts while married to Löwenthal. After being widowed, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova, thought by some to be a Russian spy; her husband, the Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov, created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.\nFollowing an episode of acute mental illness at about the age of twenty, Einstein's son Eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He spent the remainder of his life either in the care of his mother or in temporary confinement in an asylum. After her death, he was committed permanently to Burghölzli, the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich.\n\n\n=== Assistant at the Swiss Patent Office (1902–1909) ===\nEinstein graduated from the federal polytechnic school in 1900, duly certified as competent to teach mathematics and physics. His successful acquisition of Swiss citizenship in February 1901 was not followed by the usual sequel of conscription; the Swiss authorities deemed him medically unfit for military service. He found that Swiss schools too appeared to have no use for him, failing to offer him a teaching position despite the almost two years that he spent applying for one. Eventually it was with the help of Marcel Grossmann's father that he secured a post in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office, as an assistant examiner – level III.\nPatent applications that landed on Einstein's desk for his evaluation included ideas for a gravel sorter and an electric typewriter. His employers were pleased enough with his work to make his position permanent in 1903, although they did not think that he should be promoted until he had \"fully mastered machine technology\". It is conceivable that his labors at the patent office had a bearing on his development of his special theory of relativity. He arrived at his revolutionary ideas about space, time and light through thought experiments about the transmission of signals and the synchronization of clocks, matters which also figured in some of the inventions submitted to him for assessment.\nIn 1902, Einstein and some friends whom he had met in Bern formed a group that held regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy. Their choice of a name for their club, the Olympia Academy, was an ironic comment upon its far from Olympian status. Sometimes they were joined by Marić, who limited her participation in their proceedings to careful listening. The thinkers whose works they reflected upon included Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach and David Hume, all of whom significantly influenced Einstein's own subsequent ideas and beliefs.\n\n\n=== First scientific papers (1900–1905) ===\n\nEinstein's first paper, \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\" (\"Conclusions drawn from the phenomena of capillarity\"), in which he proposed a model of intermolecular attraction that he afterwards disavowed as worthless, was published in the journal Annalen der Physik in 1901. His 24-page doctoral dissertation also addressed a topic in molecular physics. Titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\") and dedicated \"Meinem Freunde Herr Dr. Marcel Grossmann gewidmet\" (to his friend Marcel Grossman), it was completed on 30 April 1905 and approved by Professor Alfred Kleiner of the University of Zurich three months later. (Einstein was formally awarded his PhD on 15 January 1906.) Four other pieces of work that Einstein completed in 1905—his famous papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy—have led to the year being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for physics akin to the miracle year of 1666 when Isaac Newton experienced his greatest epiphanies. The publications deeply impressed Einstein's contemporaries.\n\n\n=== Academic career in Europe (1908–1933) ===\nEinstein's sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in 1908, when he secured a junior teaching position at the University of Bern. In 1909, a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the University of Zurich, much admired by Alfred Kleiner, led to Zurich's luring him away from Bern with a newly created associate professorship. Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911, when he took up a chair at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, a move which required him to become an Austrian citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was not completed. His time in Prague saw him producing eleven research papers.\n\nFrom 30 October to 3 November 1911, Einstein attended the first Solvay Conference on Physics.\nIn July 1912, he returned to his alma mater, the ETH Zurich, to take up a chair in theoretical physics. His teaching activities there centered on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics, and his research interests included the molecular theory of heat, continuum mechanics and the development of a relativistic theory of gravitation. In his work on the latter topic, he was assisted by his friend Marcel Grossmann, whose knowledge of the kind of mathematics required was greater than his own.\nIn the spring of 1913, two German visitors, Max Planck and Walther Nernst, called upon Einstein in Zurich in the hope of persuading him to relocate to Berlin. They offered him membership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the directorship of the planned Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and a chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin that would allow him to pursue his research supported by a professorial salary but with no teaching duties to burden him. Their invitation was all the more appealing to him because Berlin happened to be the home of his latest girlfriend, Elsa Löwenthal. He duly joined the Academy on 24 July 1913, and moved into an apartment in the Berlin district of Dahlem on 1 April 1914. He was installed in his Humboldt University position shortly thereafter.\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 marked the beginning of Einstein's gradual estrangement from the nation of his birth. When the \"Manifesto of the Ninety-Three\" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German thinkers that justified Germany's belligerence—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to distance himself from it and sign the alternative, eirenic \"Manifesto to the Europeans\" instead. However, this expression of his doubts about German policy did not prevent him from being elected to a two-year term as president of the German Physical Society in 1916. When the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics opened its doors the following year—its foundation delayed because of the war—Einstein was appointed its first director, just as Planck and Nernst had promised.\nEinstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1920, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1921. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". At this point some physicists still regarded the general theory of relativity skeptically, and the Nobel citation displayed a degree of doubt even about the work on photoelectricity that it acknowledged: it did not assent to Einstein's notion of the particulate nature of light, which only won over the entire scientific community when S. N. Bose derived the Planck spectrum in 1924. That same year, Einstein was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Britain's closest equivalent of the Nobel award, the Royal Society's Copley Medal, was not hung around Einstein's neck until 1925. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1930.\nEinstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933. His accomplishments in Berlin had included the completion of the general theory of relativity, proving the Einstein–de Haas effect, contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and the development of Bose–Einstein statistics.\n\n\n=== Putting general relativity to the test (1919) ===\n\nIn 1907, Einstein reached a milestone on his long journey from his special theory of relativity to a new idea of gravitation with the formulation of his equivalence principle, which asserts that an observer in a box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that the field exists. In 1911, he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the Sun as it passed close to the Sun's photosphere (that is, the Sun's apparent surface). He reworked his calculation in 1913, having now found a way to model gravitation with the Riemann curvature tensor of a non-Euclidean four-dimensional spacetime. By the fall of 1915, his reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of Riemannian geometry was complete, and he applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the Sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon, the precession of the perihelion of Mercury (a slow drift in the point in Mercury's elliptical orbit at which it approaches the Sun most closely). A total eclipse of the Sun that took place on 29 May 1919 provided an opportunity to put his theory of gravitational lensing to the test, and observations performed by Sir Arthur Eddington yielded results that were consistent with his calculations. Eddington's work was reported at length in newspapers around the world. On 7 November 1919, for example, the leading British newspaper, The Times, printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\".\n\n\n=== Coming to terms with fame (1921–1923) ===\n\nWith Eddington's eclipse observations widely reported not just in academic journals but by the popular press as well, Einstein became \"perhaps the world's first celebrity scientist\", a genius who had shattered a paradigm that had been basic to physicists' understanding of the universe since the seventeenth century.\nEinstein began his new life as an intellectual icon in America, where he arrived on 2 April 1921. He was welcomed to New York City by Mayor John Francis Hylan, and then spent three weeks giving lectures and attending receptions. He spoke several times at Columbia University and Princeton, and in Washington, he visited the White House with representatives of the National Academy of Sciences. He returned to Europe via London, where he was the guest of the philosopher and statesman Viscount Haldane. He used his time in the British capital to meet several people prominent in British scientific, political or intellectual life, and to deliver a lecture at King's College. In July 1921, he published an essay, \"My First Impression of the U.S.A.\", in which he sought to sketch the American character, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville in Democracy in America (1835). He wrote of his transatlantic hosts in highly approving terms: \"What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy.\"\nIn 1922, Einstein's travels were to the old world rather than the new. He devoted six months to a tour of Asia that saw him speaking in Japan, Singapore and Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon). After his first public lecture in Tokyo, he met Emperor Yoshihito and his wife at the Imperial Palace, with thousands of spectators thronging the streets in the hope of catching a glimpse of him. (In a letter to his sons, he wrote that Japanese people seemed to him to be generally modest, intelligent and considerate, and to have a true appreciation of art. But his picture of them in his diary was less flattering: \"[the] intellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones – natural disposition?\" His journal also contains views of China and India which were uncomplimentary. Of Chinese people, he wrote that \"even the children are spiritless and look obtuse... It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary\".) He was greeted with even greater enthusiasm on the last leg of his tour, in which he spent twelve days in Mandatory Palestine, newly entrusted to British rule by the League of Nations in the aftermath of the First World War. Sir Herbert Samuel, the British High Commissioner, welcomed him with a degree of ceremony normally only accorded to a visiting head of state, including a cannon salute. One reception held in his honor was stormed by people determined to hear him speak: he told them that he was happy that Jews were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.\nEinstein's decision to tour the eastern hemisphere in 1922 meant that he was unable to go to Stockholm in the December of that year to participate in the Nobel prize ceremony. His place at the traditional Nobel banquet was taken by a German diplomat, who gave a speech praising him not only as a physicist but also as a campaigner for peace. A two-week visit to Spain that he undertook in 1923 saw him collecting another award, a membership of the Spanish Academy of Sciences signified by a diploma handed to him by King Alfonso XIII. (His Spanish trip also gave him a chance to meet a fellow Nobel laureate, the neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal.)\n\n\n=== Serving the League of Nations (1922–1932) ===\n\nFrom 1922 until 1932, with the exception of a few months in 1923 and 1924, Einstein was a member of the Geneva-based International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, a group set up by the League to encourage scientists, artists, scholars, teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with their counterparts in other countries. He was appointed as a German delegate rather than as a representative of Switzerland because of the machinations of two Catholic activists, Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta. By persuading Secretary General Eric Drummond to deny Einstein the place on the committee reserved for a Swiss thinker, they created an opening for Gonzague de Reynold, who used his League of Nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional Catholic doctrine. Einstein's former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee.\n\n\n=== Touring South America (1925) ===\nIn March and April 1925, Einstein and his wife visited South America, where they spent about a week in Brazil, a week in Uruguay and a month in Argentina. Their tour was suggested by Jorge Duclout (1856–1927) and Mauricio Nirenstein (1877–1935) with the support of several Argentine scholars, including Julio Rey Pastor, Jakob Laub, and Leopoldo Lugones. and was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and the Asociación Hebraica Argentina (Argentine Hebraic Association) with a smaller contribution from the Argentine-Germanic Cultural Institution.\n\n\n=== Touring the US (1930–1931) ===\n\nIn December 1930, Einstein began another significant sojourn in the United States, drawn back to the US by the offer of a two month research fellowship at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech supported him in his wish that he should not be exposed to quite as much attention from the media as he had experienced when visiting the US in 1921, and he therefore declined all the invitations to receive prizes or make speeches that his admirers poured down upon him. But he remained willing to allow his fans at least some of the time with him that they requested.\nAfter arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met Nicholas Murray Butler, the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \"the ruling monarch of the mind\". Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration.\n\nEinstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was \"awkward\", as Millikan \"had a penchant for patriotic militarism\", where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.\nThis aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \"highly emotional temperament\", from which came his \"extraordinary intellectual energy\".\nChaplin's film City Lights was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. Walter Isaacson, Einstein's biographer, described this as \"one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity\". Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his \"modest little flat\" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was \"possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis\". Einstein and Chaplin were cheered at the premiere of the film. Chaplin said to Einstein, \"They cheer me because they understand me, and they cheer you because no one understands you.\"\n\n\n=== Emigration to the US (1933) ===\n\nIn February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.\nWhile at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In February and March 1933, the Gestapo repeatedly raided his family's apartment in Berlin. He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag had passed the Enabling Act on 23 March, transforming Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship, and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin. Later on, they heard that their cottage had been raided by the Nazis and Einstein's personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, Einstein immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.\n\n\n==== Refugee status ====\n\nIn April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with \"virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues\", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.\nA month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, \"Jewish intellectualism is dead.\" One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, \"not yet hanged\", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, \"... I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise.\" After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a \"spontaneous emotional outburst\" by those who \"shun popular enlightenment\", and \"more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence\".\nEinstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. Aided by the Academic Assistance Council, founded in April 1933 by British Liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics escape Nazi persecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years. Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a secluded wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.\n\nLocker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George. Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend physicist Frederick Lindemann to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities. Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their \"technical standards\" and put the Allies' technology ahead of theirs.\nEinstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey's Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü, to whom he wrote in September 1933, requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over \"1,000 saved individuals\".\nLocker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. In his speech he described Einstein as a \"citizen of the world\" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK. Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar.\n\n\n==== Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study ====\n\nOn 3 October 1933, Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout. Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.\nEinstein was still undecided about his future. He had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford, where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a five-year research fellowship (called a \"studentship\" at Christ Church), but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.\nEinstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955. He was one of the four first selected (along with John von Neumann, Kurt Gödel and Hermann Weyl) at the new Institute. He soon developed a close friendship with Gödel; the two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully. He lived in Princeton at his home from 1935 onwards. The Albert Einstein House was made a National Historic Landmark in 1976.\n\n\n==== World War II and the Manhattan Project ====\n\nIn 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington, D.C. to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\" To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.\nThe letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian royal family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project.\nFor Einstein, \"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \"I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them ...\" In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons. In 1960 Einstein was included posthumously as a charter member of the World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS), an organization founded by distinguished scientists and intellectuals who committed themselves to the responsible and ethical advances of science, particularly in light of the development of nuclear weapons.\n\n\n==== US citizenship ====\n\nEinstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture compared to Europe. He recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\" without social barriers. As a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his early education.\nEinstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans. He considered racism America's \"worst disease\", seeing it as \"handed down from one generation to the next\". As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial as an alleged foreign agent in 1951. When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.\nIn 1946, Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\" A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. Einstein has said, \"Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination\". Isaacson writes that \"When Marian Anderson, the black contralto, came to Princeton for a concert in 1937, the Nassau Inn refused her a room. So Einstein invited her to stay at his house on Main Street, in what was a deeply personal as well as symbolic gesture ... Whenever she returned to Princeton, she stayed with Einstein, her last visit coming just two months before he died.\"\n\n\n=== Personal views ===\n\n\n==== Political views ====\n\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the signatories of the founding proclamation of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party. Later in his life, Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"Why Socialism?\". His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a \"well-regulated system of government\" and called their rule a \"regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\". He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin:\n\nIn Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind's conscience.\nEinstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation. He wrote \"I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself.\" The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932; by the time of his death, it was 1,427 pages long.\nEinstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded. He described Gandhi as \"a role model for the generations to come\". The initial connection was established on 27 September 1931, when Wilfrid Israel took his Indian guest V. A. Sundaram to meet his friend Einstein at his summer home in the town of Caputh. Sundaram was Gandhi's disciple and special envoy, whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting the Indian leader's home in 1925. During the visit, Einstein wrote a short letter to Gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy, and Gandhi responded quickly with his own letter. Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped, the direct connection between them was established through Wilfrid Israel.\n\n\n==== Relationship with Zionism ====\n\nEinstein was a figurehead leader in the establishment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He made suggestions for the creation of an Institute of Agriculture, a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. He also promoted the establishment of an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic.\nEinstein was not a nationalist and opposed the creation of an independent Jewish state. He felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine. The state of Israel was established without his help in 1948; Einstein was limited to a marginal role in the Zionist movement. Upon the death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of President of Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\". Einstein wrote that he was \"deeply moved\", but \"at once saddened and ashamed\" that he could not accept it. Einstein did not want the office, and Israel did not want him to accept, but felt obliged to make the offer. Yitzhak Navon, Ben-Gurion's political secretary, and later president, reports Ben-Gurion as saying \"Tell me what to do if he says yes! I've had to offer the post to him because it's impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in for trouble.\"\n\n\n==== Religious and philosophical views ====\n\nPer Lee Smolin, \"I believe what allowed Einstein to achieve so much was primarily a moral quality. He simply cared far more than most of his colleagues that the laws of physics have to explain everything in nature coherently and consistently.\" Einstein expounded his spiritual outlook in a wide array of writings and interviews. He said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy. He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve. He clarified, however, that \"I am not an atheist\", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a \"deeply religious nonbeliever\". He wrote that \"A spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe—a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort.\"\nEinstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York, and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, \"Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.\"\nIn a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:\n\nThe word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them.\nEinstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time. In a letter in 1930 to Hermann Huth, vice-president of the German Vegetarian Federation (Deutsche Vegetarier-Bund), he wrote:\n\nAlthough I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.\nHe became a vegetarian himself only during the last part of his life. In March 1954 he wrote in a letter: \"So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It almost seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore.\"\n\"Albert Einstein [...] also read Blavatsky and attended lectures by Rudolf Steiner.\"\n\n\n==== Love of music ====\n\nEinstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote:\n\nIf I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music ... I get most joy in life out of music.\nHis mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.\nWhen he turned 13, he discovered Mozart's violin sonatas, whereupon he became enamored of Mozart's compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". He said that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty\". At the age of 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven's violin sonatas. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was \"remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'\". What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.\"\nMusic took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, including Kurt Appelbaum, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zurich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalog of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation. Mozart was a special favorite; he said that \"Mozart's music is so pure it seems to have been ever-present in the universe.\" However, he preferred Bach to Beethoven, once saying: \"Give me Bach, rather, and then more Bach.\"\nIn 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the Zoellner Quartet. Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was \"impressed by Einstein's level of coordination and intonation\".\n\n\n=== Death ===\nOn 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948. He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.\nEinstein refused surgery, saying, \"I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.\" He died in the Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.\nDuring the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein's remains were cremated in Trenton, New Jersey, and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.\nIn a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: \"He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.\"\nEinstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.\n\n\n== Scientific career ==\nThroughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents. In addition to the work he did by himself, he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects, including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.\n\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\n\n\n==== Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics ====\n\nEinstein's first paper, submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik, was on capillary attraction. It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.\n\n\n==== Theory of critical opalescence ====\n\nEinstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\n\n\n=== 1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers ===\nThe Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The four papers are:\n\n\n=== Special relativity ===\n\nEinstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.\nThis paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.\nIn his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E = mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations. Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.\nEinstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.\n\n\n=== General relativity ===\n\n\n==== General relativity and the equivalence principle ====\n\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to it, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics; it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory. Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing.\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.\n\n\n==== Gravitational waves ====\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\nThe first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16. The explanation for the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction.\n\n\n==== Hole argument and Entwurf theory ====\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\n\n\n==== Physical cosmology ====\n\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was lacking at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, into the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.\nFollowing the discovery of the recession of the galaxies by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, the Friedmann–Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein–de Sitter universe of 1932. In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\".\nIn many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his \"biggest blunder\", based on a letter George Gamow claimed to have received from him. The astrophysicist Mario Livio has cast doubt on this claim.\nIn late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the galaxies, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process that he associated with the cosmological constant. As he stated in the paper, \"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's  [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time [...] If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\"\nIt thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.\n\n\n==== Energy momentum pseudotensor ====\n\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\nEinstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. While the use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was criticized by Erwin Schrödinger and others, Einstein's approach has been echoed by physicists including Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz.\n\n\n==== Wormholes ====\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches. Because these solutions included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body, Einstein and Rosen suggested that they could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles. However, it was later found that Einstein–Rosen bridges are not stable.\n\n\n==== Einstein–Cartan theory ====\n\nIn order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\n\n\n==== Equations of motion ====\n\nIn general relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime. A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body's attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses. A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory: \"Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\" The Einstein field equations cover the latter aspect of the theory, relating the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. The geodesic equation covers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime. Einstein regarded this as an \"independent fundamental assumption\" that had to be postulated in addition to the field equations in order to complete the theory. Believing this to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally presented, he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves. Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. Accordingly, Einstein proposed that the field equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic. Both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity, but this claim remains disputed.\n\n\n=== Old quantum theory ===\n\n\n==== Photons and energy quanta ====\n\nIn a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is the Planck constant. He did not say much more, because he was not sure how the particles were related to the wave. But he did suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect. Light quanta were dubbed photons by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926.\n\n\n==== Quantized atomic vibrations ====\n\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.\n\n\n==== Bose–Einstein statistics ====\n\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.\n\n\n==== Wave–particle duality ====\n\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern. In \"Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon concept and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\n\n\n==== Zero-point energy ====\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.\n\n\n==== Stimulated emission ====\nIn 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.\nThis article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.\n\n\n==== Matter waves ====\nEinstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein observed that de Broglie waves could explain the quantization rules of Bohr and Sommerfeld. This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.\n\n\n=== Quantum mechanics ===\n\n\n==== Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics ====\n\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\". Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.\n\n\n==== Bohr versus Einstein ====\n\n The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n\n\n==== Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox ====\n\nEinstein never fully accepted quantum mechanics. While he recognized that it made correct predictions, he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible. Over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect, but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with Bohr in 1930. Einstein suggested a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other. The quantum-mechanical description of the two objects is a mathematical entity known as a wavefunction. If the wavefunction that describes the two objects before their interaction is given, then the Schrödinger equation provides the wavefunction that describes them after their interaction. But because of what would later be called quantum entanglement, measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object, no matter how far away it is. Moreover, the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object. Einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast. Indeed, he argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another, and such instantaneous influences would call that into question. Because the true \"physical condition\" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, Einstein concluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of it.\nA more famous version of this argument came in 1935, when Einstein published a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox. In this thought experiment, two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled. Then, no matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would imply the ability to predict, perfectly, the result of measuring the position of the other particle. Likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way. They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other, since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light, which is forbidden by the theory of relativity. They invoked a principle, later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\", positing that: \"If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity.\" From this, they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured. But quantum mechanics considers these two observables incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality.\nIn 1964, John Stewart Bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further. He deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. This constraint would later be called a Bell inequality. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. Consequently, the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are \"nonlocal\", which is to say that somehow the two particles are able to interact instantaneously no matter how widely they ever become separated. Bell argued that because an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality, the EPR paradox \"is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least\".\nDespite this, and although Einstein personally found the argument in the EPR paper overly complicated, that paper became among the most influential papers published in Physical Review. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.\n\n\n=== Unified field theory ===\n\nEncouraged by his success with general relativity, Einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. In 1950, he described his unified field theory in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\". His attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won him praise but not success: a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which was well understood until many years after his death. Although most researchers now believe that Einstein's approach to unifying physics was mistaken, his goal of a theory of everything is one to which his successors still aspire.\n\n\n=== Other investigations ===\n\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.\n\n\n=== Collaboration with other scientists ===\n\nIn addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\n\n\n==== Einstein–de Haas experiment ====\n\nIn 1908, Owen Willans Richardson predicted that a change in the magnetic moment of a free body will cause this body to rotate. This effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials. Einstein and Wander Johannes de Haas published two papers in 1915 claiming the first experimental observation of the effect. Measurements of this kind demonstrate that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment (polarization) of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization. These measurements also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization: that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons. The Einstein-de Haas experiment is the only experiment conceived, realized and published by Albert Einstein himself.\nA complete original version of the Einstein-de Haas experimental equipment was donated by Geertruida de Haas-Lorentz, wife of de Haas and daughter of Lorentz, to the Ampère Museum in Lyon France in 1961 where it is currently on display. It was lost among the museum's holdings and was rediscovered in 2023.\n\n\n==== Einstein as an inventor ====\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator. This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. On 11 November 1930, U.S. patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, but the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux.\nEinstein also invented an electromagnetic pump, sound reproduction device, and several other household devices.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Non-scientific ===\n\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.\nIn his final four years, Einstein was involved with the establishment of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.\nIn 1979, the Albert Einstein Memorial was unveiled outside the National Academy of Sciences building in Washington, D.C. for the Einstein centenary. It was sculpted by Robert Berks. Einstein can be seen holding a paper with three of his most important equations: for the photoelectric effect, general relativity and mass-energy equivalence.\nEinstein's right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California. Although the court initially held that the right had expired, that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The right is enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right. Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.\nMount Einstein in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska was named in 1955. Mount Einstein in New Zealand's Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.\nIn 1999, Einstein was named Time's Person of the Century.\n\n\n=== Scientific ===\nIn 1999, a survey of the top 100 physicists voted for Einstein as the \"greatest physicist ever\", while a parallel survey of rank-and-file physicists gave the top spot to Isaac Newton, with Einstein second.\nPhysicist Lev Landau ranked physicists from 0 to 5 on a logarithmic scale of productivity and genius, with Newton and Einstein belonging in a \"super league\", with Newton receiving the highest ranking of 0, followed by Einstein with 0.5, while fathers of quantum mechanics such as Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac were ranked 1, with Landau himself a 2.\n\nPhysicist Eugene Wigner noted that while John von Neumann had the quickest and most acute mind he ever knew, it was Einstein who had the more penetrating and original mind of the two, stating that:But Einstein's understanding was deeper than even Jancsi von Neumann's. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's. And that is a very remarkable statement. Einstein took an extraordinary pleasure in invention. Two of his greatest inventions are the Special and General Theories of Relativity; and for all of Jancsi's brilliance, he never produced anything so original. No modern physicist has. The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics declared 2005 the \"World Year of Physics\", also known as \"Einstein Year\", in recognition of Einstein's \"miracle year\" in 1905. It was also declared the \"International Year of Physics\" by the United Nations.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nEinstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities after the confirmation of his general theory of relativity in 1919. Although most of the public had little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and admired. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". Eventually he came to cope with unwanted enquirers by pretending to be someone else: \"Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.\"\nEinstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was \"a cartoonist's dream come true\". His intellectual achievements and originality made Einstein broadly synonymous with genius.\nMany popular quotations are often misattributed to him.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\nEinstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.\nEinsteinium, a synthetic chemical element, was named in his honor in 1955, a few months after his death.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Scientific ===\n\n\n=== Popular ===\n\n\n=== Political ===\nEinstein, Albert; et al.

He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, hydrodynamics, geology, optics, and tribology, but he did not publish his findings and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life (1452–1472) ===\n\n\n==== Birth and background ====\n\nLeonardo da Vinci, properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (\"Leonardo, son of ser Piero from Vinci\"), was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, Italy 20 miles from Florence. He was born out of wedlock to Piero da Vinci (Ser Piero da Vinci d'Antonio di ser Piero di ser Guido; 1426–1504), a Florentine legal notary, and Caterina di Meo Lippi (c. 1434–1494), from the lower class. It remains uncertain where Leonardo was born; the traditional account, from a local oral tradition recorded by the historian Emanuele Repetti, is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered sufficient privacy for the illegitimate birth, though it is still possible he was born in a house in Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had. Leonardo's parents both married separately the year after his birth. Caterina – who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only \"Caterina\" or \"Catelina\" – is usually identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca, who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca, nicknamed L'Accattabriga, 'the quarrelsome one'. Having been betrothed to her the previous year, Ser Piero married Albiera Amadori and after her death in 1464, went on to have three subsequent marriages. From all the marriages, Leonardo eventually had 16 half-siblings (of whom 11 survived infancy) who were much younger than he (the last was born when Leonardo was 46 years old) and with whom he had very little contact.\n\nVery little is known about Leonardo's childhood and much is shrouded in myth, partially because of his biography in the frequently apocryphal Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1550) by 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari. Tax records indicate that by at least 1457 he lived in the household of his paternal grandfather, Antonio da Vinci, but it is possible that he spent the years before then in the care of his mother in Vinci, either Anchiano or Campo Zeppi in the parish of San Pantaleone. He is thought to have been close to his uncle, Francesco da Vinci, but his father was probably in Florence most of the time. Ser Piero, who was the descendant of a long line of notaries, established an official residence in Florence by at least 1469 and had a successful career. Despite his family history, Leonardo only received a basic and informal education in (vernacular) writing, reading, and mathematics; possibly because his artistic talents were recognised early, so his family decided to focus their attention there.\nLater in life, Leonardo recorded his earliest memory, now in the Codex Atlanticus. While writing on the flight of birds, he recalled as an infant when a kite came to his cradle and opened his mouth with its tail; commentators still debate whether the anecdote was an actual memory or a fantasy.\n\n\n==== Verrocchio's workshop ====\n\nIn the mid-1460s, Leonardo's family moved to Florence, which at the time was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture. Around the age of 14, he became a garzone (studio boy) in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, who was the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his time. This was about the time of the death of Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor Donatello. Leonardo became an apprentice by the age of 17 and remained in training for seven years. Other famous painters apprenticed in the workshop or associated with it include Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli, and Lorenzo di Credi. Leonardo was exposed to both theoretical training and a wide range of technical skills, including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics, and woodwork, as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting, and modelling.\nLeonardo was a contemporary of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino, who were all slightly older than he was. He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio or at the Platonic Academy of the Medici. Florence was ornamented by the works of artists such as Donatello's contemporaries Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, and was the first painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Leon Battista Alberti's treatise De pictura were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.\nMuch of the painting in Verrocchio's workshop was done by his assistants. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ (c. 1472–1475), painting the young angel holding Jesus's robe with skill so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio purportedly put down his brush and never painted again (the latter claim probably being apocryphal). The new technique of oil paint was applied to areas of the mostly tempera work, including the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream, and much of Jesus's figure, indicating Leonardo's hand. Additionally, Leonardo may have been a model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.\nVasari tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: a local peasant made himself a round buckler shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo, inspired by the story of Medusa, responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that his father bought a different shield to give to the peasant and sold Leonardo's to a Florentine art dealer for 100 ducats, who in turn sold it to the Duke of Milan.\n\n\n=== First Florentine period (1472 – c. 1482) ===\n\nBy 1472, at the age of 20, Leonardo qualified as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate and live with him. Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a 1473 pen-and-ink drawing of the Arno valley (see below). According to Vasari, the young Leonardo was the first to suggest making the Arno river a navigable channel between Florence and Pisa.\nIn January 1478, Leonardo received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of Saint Bernard in the Florentine town hall, the Palazzo della Signoria, an indication of his independence from Verrocchio's studio. An anonymous early biographer, known as Anonimo Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with the Medici and often worked in the garden of the Piazza San Marco, Florence, where a Neoplatonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers organised by the Medici met. In March 1481, he received a commission from the monks of San Donato in Scopeto for The Adoration of the Magi. Neither of these initial commissions were completed, being abandoned when Leonardo went to offer his services to Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza. Leonardo wrote Sforza a letter which described the diverse things that he could achieve in the fields of engineering and weapon design, and mentioned that he could paint. He brought with him a silver string instrument – either a lute or lyre – in the form of a horse's head.\nWith Alberti, Leonardo visited the home of the Medici and through them came to know the older Humanist philosophers of whom Marsiglio Ficino, proponent of Neoplatonism; Cristoforo Landino, writer of commentaries on Classical writings, and John Argyropoulos, teacher of Greek and translator of Aristotle were the foremost. Also associated with the Platonic Academy of the Medici was Leonardo's contemporary, the brilliant young poet and philosopher Pico della Mirandola. In 1482, Leonardo was sent as an ambassador by Lorenzo de' Medici to Ludovico il Moro, who ruled Milan between 1479 and 1499.\n\n\n=== First Milanese period (c. 1482–1499) ===\n\nLeonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary (on behalf of Sforza) to meet king Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a Madonna. In 1490 he was called as a consultant, together with Francesco di Giorgio Martini, for the building site of the cathedral of Pavia and was struck by the equestrian statue of Regisole, of which he left a sketch. Leonardo was employed on many other projects for Sforza, such as preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions; a drawing of, and wooden model for, a competition to design the cupola for Milan Cathedral; and a model for a huge equestrian monument to Ludovico's predecessor Francesco Sforza. This would have surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello's Gattamelata in Padua and Verrocchio's Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, and became known as the Gran Cavallo. Leonardo completed a model for the horse and made detailed plans for its casting, but in November 1494, Ludovico gave the metal to his brother-in-law to be used for a cannon to defend the city from Charles VIII of France.\n\nContemporary correspondence records that Leonardo and his assistants were commissioned by the Duke of Milan to paint the Sala delle Asse in the Sforza Castle, c. 1498. The project became a trompe-l'œil decoration that made the great hall appear to be a pergola created by the interwoven limbs of sixteen mulberry trees, whose canopy included an intricate labyrinth of leaves and knots on the ceiling.\n\n\n=== Second Florentine period (1500–1508) ===\n\nWhen Ludovico Sforza was overthrown by France in 1500, Leonardo fled Milan for Venice, accompanied by his assistant Salaì and friend, the mathematician Luca Pacioli. In Venice, Leonardo was employed as a military architect and engineer, devising methods to defend the city from naval attack. On his return to Florence in 1500, he and his household were guests of the Servite monks at the monastery of Santissima Annunziata and were provided with a workshop where, according to Vasari, Leonardo created the cartoon of The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist, a work that won such admiration that \"men [and] women, young and old\" flocked to see it \"as if they were going to a solemn festival.\"\nIn Cesena in 1502, Leonardo entered the service of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, acting as a military architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron. Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of Imola in order to win his patronage. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.\nLeonardo had left Borgia's service and returned to Florence by early 1503, where he rejoined the Guild of Saint Luke on 18 October of that year. By this same month, Leonardo had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model for the Mona Lisa, which he would continue working on until his later years. In January 1504, he was part of a committee formed to recommend where Michelangelo's statue of David should be placed. He then spent two years in Florence designing and painting a mural of The Battle of Anghiari for the Signoria, with Michelangelo designing its companion piece, The Battle of Cascina.\nIn 1506, Leonardo was summoned to Milan by Charles II d'Amboise, the acting French governor of the city. There, Leonardo took on another pupil, Count Francesco Melzi, the son of a Lombard aristocrat, who is considered to have been his favourite student. The Council of Florence wished Leonardo to return promptly to finish The Battle of Anghiari, but he was given leave at the behest of Louis XII, who considered commissioning the artist to make some portraits. Leonardo may have commenced a project for an equestrian figure of d'Amboise; a wax model attributed to him survives and would be the only extant example of Leonardo's sculpture, but the attribution is not widely accepted. Leonardo was otherwise free to pursue his scientific interests. Many of Leonardo's most prominent pupils either knew or worked with him in Milan, including Bernardino Luini, Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, and Marco d'Oggiono. In 1507, Leonardo was in Florence sorting out a dispute with his brothers over the estate of his father, who had died in 1504.\n\n\n=== Second Milanese period (1508–1513) ===\nBy 1508, Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in the parish of Santa Babila.\nIn 1512, Leonardo was working on plans for an equestrian monument for Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, but this was prevented by an invasion of a confederation of Swiss, Spanish and Venetian forces, which drove the French from Milan. Leonardo stayed in the city, spending several months in 1513 at the Medici's Vaprio d'Adda villa.\n\n\n=== Rome and France (1513–1519) ===\n\nIn March 1513, Lorenzo de' Medici's son Giovanni assumed the papacy (as Leo X); Leonardo went to Rome that September, where he was received by the pope's brother Giuliano. From September 1513 to 1516, Leonardo spent much of his time living in the Belvedere Courtyard in the Apostolic Palace, where Michelangelo and Raphael were both active. Leonardo was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month and, according to Vasari, decorated a lizard with scales dipped in quicksilver. The pope gave him a painting commission of unknown subject matter, but cancelled it when the artist set about developing a new kind of varnish. Leonardo became ill, in what may have been the first of multiple strokes leading to his death. He practised botany in the Vatican Gardens, and was commissioned to make plans for the Pope's proposed draining of the Pontine Marshes. He also dissected cadavers, making notes for a treatise on vocal cords; these he gave to an official in hopes of regaining the Pope's favour, but he was unsuccessful.\nIn October 1515, King Francis I of France recaptured Milan. On 21 March 1516 Antonio Maria Pallavicini, the French ambassador to the Holy See, received a letter sent from Lyon a week previously by the royal advisor Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet, containing the French king's instructions to assist Leonardo in his relocation to France and to inform the artist that the King was eagerly awaiting his arrival. Pallavicini was also asked to reassure Leonardo that he would be well received at court, both by the King and by his mother, Louise of Savoy. Leonardo entered Francis's service later that year, and was given the use of the manor house Clos Lucé near the King's residence at the royal Château d'Amboise. He was frequently visited by Francis, and drew plans for an immense castle town the King intended to erect at Romorantin. He also made a mechanical lion, which during a pageant walked towards the King and – upon being struck by a wand – opened its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies.\nLeonardo was accompanied during this time by his friend and apprentice Francesco Melzi, and was supported by a pension totalling 10,000 scudi. At some point, Melzi drew a portrait of Leonardo; the only others known from his lifetime were a sketch by an unknown assistant on the back of one of Leonardo's studies (c. 1517) and a drawing by Giovanni Ambrogio Figino depicting an elderly Leonardo with his right arm wrapped in clothing. The latter, in addition to the record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d'Aragon, confirms an account of Leonardo's right hand being paralytic when he was 65, which may indicate why he left works such as the Mona Lisa unfinished. He continued to work at some capacity until eventually becoming ill and bedridden for several months.\n\n\n==== Death ====\n\nLeonardo died at Clos Lucé on 2 May 1519 at the age of 67, possibly of a stroke. Francis I had become a close friend. Vasari describes Leonardo as lamenting on his deathbed, full of repentance, that \"he had offended against God and men by failing to practice his art as he should have done.\" Vasari states that in his last days, Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the Holy Sacrament. Vasari also records that the King held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died, although this story may be legend rather than fact. In accordance with his will, sixty beggars carrying tapers followed Leonardo's casket. Melzi was the principal heir and executor, receiving, as well as money, Leonardo's paintings, tools, library and personal effects. Leonardo's other long-time pupil and companion, Salaì, and his servant Baptista de Vilanis, each received half of Leonardo's vineyards. His brothers received land, and his serving woman received a fur-lined cloak. On 12 August 1519, Leonardo's remains were interred in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florentin at the Château d'Amboise.\nSome 20 years after Leonardo's death, Francis was reported by the goldsmith and sculptor Benvenuto Cellini as saying: \"There had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo, not so much about painting, sculpture and architecture, as that he was a very great philosopher.\"\nSalaì, or Il Salaino (\"The Little Unclean One\", i.e., the devil), entered Leonardo's household in 1490 as an assistant. After only a year, Leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours, calling him \"a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton,\" after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes. Nevertheless, Leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in Leonardo's household for the next thirty years. Salaì executed paintings under the name of Andrea Salaì, but although Vasari claims that Leonardo \"taught him many things about painting,\" his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo's pupils, such as Marco d'Oggiono and Boltraffio.\nAt the time of his death in 1524, Salaì owned a painting referred to as Joconda in a posthumous inventory of his belongings; it was assessed at 505 lire, an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nDespite the thousands of pages Leonardo left in notebooks and manuscripts, he scarcely made reference to his personal life.\nWithin Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his \"great physical beauty\" and \"infinite grace,\" as described by Vasari, as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. One such aspect was his love for animals, likely including vegetarianism and according to Vasari, a habit of purchasing caged birds and releasing them.\nLeonardo had many friends who are now notable either in their fields or for their historical significance, including mathematician Luca Pacioli, with whom he collaborated on the book Divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella. While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella that appears to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.\nBeyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire, analysis, and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by Sigmund Freud in his Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood. Leonardo's most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salaì and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Walter Isaacson in his biography of Leonardo makes explicit his opinion that the relations with Salaì were intimate and homosexual.\n\nIn 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, court records show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a known male prostitute. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal. Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in Saint John the Baptist and Bacchus and more explicitly in erotic drawings. \n\n\n== Paintings ==\n\nDespite the recent awareness and admiration of Leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter. A handful of works that are either authenticated or attributed to him have been regarded as among the great masterpieces. These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities that have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics. By the 1490s Leonardo had already been described as a \"Divine\" painter.\nAmong the qualities that make Leonardo's work unique are his innovative techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.\n\n\n=== Early works ===\n\nLeonardo first gained attention for his work on the Baptism of Christ, painted in conjunction with Verrocchio. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at Verrocchio's workshop, both of which are Annunciations. One is small, 59 centimetres (23 in) long and 14 cm (5.5 in) high. It is a \"predella\" to go at the base of a larger composition, a painting by Lorenzo di Credi from which it has become separated. The other is a much larger work, 217 cm (85 in) long. In both Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, like two well-known pictures by Fra Angelico of the same subject, of the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily. Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.\nIn the smaller painting, Mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.\n\n\n=== Paintings of the 1480s ===\n\nIn the 1480s, Leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work that was of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition. Two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment.\nOne of these paintings was Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, which Bortolon associates with a difficult period of Leonardo's life, as evidenced in his diary: \"I thought I was learning to live; I was only learning to die.\" Although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual. Jerome, as a penitent, occupies the middle of the picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to the outer edge of the painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo's anatomical studies. Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.\nThe daring display of figure composition, the landscape elements and personal drama also appear in the great unfinished masterpiece, the Adoration of the Magi, a commission from the Monks of San Donato a Scopeto. It is a complex composition, of about 250 × 250 centimetres. Leonardo did numerous drawings and preparatory studies, including a detailed one in linear perspective of the ruined classical architecture that forms part of the background. In 1482 Leonardo went to Milan at the behest of Lorenzo de' Medici in order to win favour with Ludovico il Moro, and the painting was abandoned.\n\nThe third important work of this period is the Virgin of the Rocks, commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting, to be done with the assistance of the de Predis brothers, was to fill a large complex altarpiece. Leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant John the Baptist, in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water. While the painting is quite large, about 200 × 120 centimetres, it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of San Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished: one remained at the chapel of the Confraternity, while Leonardo took the other to France. The Brothers did not get their painting, however, nor the de Predis their payment, until the next century.\nLeonardo's most remarkable portrait of this period is the Lady with an Ermine, presumed to be Cecilia Gallerani (c. 1483–1490), lover of Ludovico Sforza. The painting is characterised by the pose of the figure with the head turned at a very different angle to the torso, unusual at a date when many portraits were still rigidly in profile. The ermine plainly carries symbolic meaning, relating either to the sitter, or to Ludovico who belonged to the prestigious Order of the Ermine.\n\n\n=== Paintings of the 1490s ===\n\nLeonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is The Last Supper, commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. It represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death, and shows the moment when Jesus has just said \"one of you will betray me\", and the consternation that this statement caused.\nThe writer Matteo Bandello observed Leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.\nThe painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterisation, but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as \"completely ruined.\" Leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso, resulting in a surface subject to mould and to flaking. Despite this, the painting remains one of the most reproduced works of art; countless copies have been made in various mediums.\nToward the end of this period, in 1498 Leonardo's trompe-l'œil decoration of the Sala delle Asse was painted for the Duke of Milan in the Castello Sforzesco.\n\n\n=== Paintings of the 1500s ===\nIn 1505, Leonardo was commissioned to paint The Battle of Anghiari in the Salone dei Cinquecento (\"Hall of the Five Hundred\") in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Leonardo devised a dynamic composition depicting four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440. Michelangelo was assigned the opposite wall to depict the Battle of Cascina. Leonardo's painting deteriorated rapidly and is now known from a copy by Rubens.\n\nAmong the works created by Leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the Mona Lisa or La Gioconda, the laughing one. In the present era, it is arguably the most famous painting in the world. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality perhaps due to the subtly shadowed corners of the mouth and eyes such that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined. The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called sfumato, or \"Leonardo's smoke\". Vasari wrote that the smile was \"so pleasing that it seems more divine than human, and it was considered a wondrous thing that it was as lively as the smile of the living original.\"\nOther characteristics of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details; the dramatic landscape background, in which the world seems to be in a state of flux; the subdued colouring; and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils laid on much like tempera, and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable. Vasari expressed that the painting's quality would make even \"the most confident master ... despair and lose heart.\" The perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.\nIn the painting Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape, which Wasserman describes as \"breathtakingly beautiful\" and harkens back to the Saint Jerome with the figure set at an oblique angle. What makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, Saint Anne. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice. This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.\n\n\n== Drawings ==\n\nLeonardo was a prolific draughtsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper. His earliest dated drawing is a Landscape of the Arno Valley, 1473, which shows the river, the mountains, Montelupo Castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail.\nAmong his famous drawings are the Vitruvian Man, a study of the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160 × 100 cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne in the Louvre.\nOther drawings of interest include numerous studies generally referred to as \"caricatures\" because, although exaggerated, they appear to be based upon observation of live models. Vasari relates that Leonardo would look for interesting faces in public to use as models for some of his work. There are numerous studies of beautiful young men, often associated with Salaì, with the rare and much admired facial feature, the so-called \"Grecian profile\". These faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior. Salaì is often depicted in fancy-dress costume. Leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated. Other, often meticulous, drawings show studies of drapery. A marked development in Leonardo's ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works. Another often-reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by Leonardo in Florence in 1479 showing the body of Bernardo Baroncelli, hanged in connection with the murder of Giuliano, brother of Lorenzo de' Medici, in the Pazzi conspiracy. In his notes, Leonardo recorded the colours of the robes that Baroncelli was wearing when he died.\nLike the two contemporary architects Donato Bramante (who designed the Belvedere Courtyard) and Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, Leonardo experimented with designs for centrally planned churches, some of which appear in his journals, as both plans and views, although none was ever realised.\n\n\n== Journals and notes ==\n\nRenaissance humanism recognised no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him. Leonardo's notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water. There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, flying machines and architecture.\n\nThese notebooks – originally loose papers of different types and sizes – were largely entrusted to Leonardo's pupil and heir Francesco Melzi after the master's death. These were to be published, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing. Some of Leonardo's drawings were copied by an anonymous Milanese artist for a planned treatise on art (Codex Huygens, c. 1570). After Melzi's death in 1570, the collection passed to his son, the lawyer Orazio, who initially took little interest in the journals. In 1587, a Melzi household tutor named Lelio Gavardi took 13 of the manuscripts to Pisa; there, the architect Giovanni Magenta reproached Gavardi for having taken the manuscripts illicitly and returned them to Orazio. Having many more such works in his possession, Orazio gifted the volumes to Magenta. News spread of these lost works of Leonardo's, and Orazio retrieved seven of the 13 manuscripts, which he then gave to Pompeo Leoni for publication in two volumes; one of these was the Codex Atlanticus. The other six works had been distributed to a few others. After Orazio's death, his heirs sold the rest of Leonardo's possessions, and thus began their dispersal.\nSome works have found their way into major collections such as the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, the Louvre, the Biblioteca Nacional de España, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, which holds the 12-volume Codex Atlanticus, and the British Library in London, which has put a selection from the Codex Arundel (BL Arundel MS 263) online. Works have also been at Holkham Hall, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and in the private hands of John Nicholas Brown I and Robert Lehman. The Codex Leicester is the only privately owned major scientific work of Leonardo; it is owned by Bill Gates and displayed once a year in different cities around the world.\n\nMost of Leonardo's writings are in mirror-image cursive. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left. Leonardo used a variety of shorthand and symbols, and states in his notes that he intended to prepare them for publication. In many cases a single topic is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet, together conveying information that would not be lost if the pages were published out of order. Why they were not published during Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.\n\n\n== Science and inventions ==\n\nLeonardo's approach to science was observational: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation. Since he lacked formal education in Latin and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin. His keen observations in many areas were noted, such as when he wrote \"Il sole non si muove\" (\"The Sun does not move\").\nIn the 1490s he studied mathematics under Luca Pacioli and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli's book Divina proportione, published in 1509. While living in Milan, he studied light from the summit of Monte Rosa. Scientific writings in his notebook on fossils have been considered as influential on early palaeontology.\nThe content of his journals suggest that he was planning a series of treatises on a variety of subjects. A coherent treatise on anatomy is said to have been observed during a visit by Cardinal Louis d'Aragon's secretary in 1517. Aspects of his work on the studies of anatomy, light and the landscape were assembled for publication by Melzi and eventually published as A Treatise on Painting in France and Italy in 1651 and Germany in 1724, with engravings based upon drawings by the Classical painter Nicolas Poussin. According to Arasse, the treatise, which in France went into 62 editions in 50 years, caused Leonardo to be seen as \"the precursor of French academic thought on art.\"\nWhile Leonardo's experimentation followed scientific methods, a recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by Fritjof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from Galileo, Newton and other scientists who followed him in that, as a \"Renaissance Man\", his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.\n\n\n=== Anatomy and physiology ===\n\nLeonardo started his study of the anatomy of the human body under the apprenticeship of Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject. As an artist, he quickly became master of topographic anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features.\nAs a successful artist, Leonardo was given permission to dissect human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor Marcantonio della Torre, professor of Anatomy at the University of Pavia. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words toward a treatise on anatomy. Only a small amount of the material on anatomy was published in Leonardo's Treatise on Painting. During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht Dürer, who made drawings from them.\nLeonardo's anatomical drawings include many studies of the human skeleton, its parts, and the muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a foetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.\nLeonardo also closely observed and recorded the effects of age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of age. He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness. Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also made studies of horses.\nLeonardo's dissections and documentation of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped to describe the physiology and mechanics of movement. He attempted to identify the source of 'emotions' and their expression. He found it difficult to incorporate the prevailing system and theories of bodily humours, but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns.\n\n\n=== Engineering and inventions ===\n\nDuring his lifetime, Leonardo was also valued as an engineer. With the same rational and analytical approach that moved him to represent the human body and to investigate anatomy, Leonardo studied and designed many machines and devices. He drew their \"anatomy\" with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, including a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components. Those studies and projects collected in his codices fill more than 5,000 pages. In a letter of 1482 to the lord of Milan Ludovico il Moro, he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled from Milan to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. In 1502, he created a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. He continued to contemplate the canalisation of Lombardy's plains while in Louis XII's company and of the Loire and its tributaries in the company of Francis I. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.\n\nLeonardo was fascinated by the phenomenon of flight for much of his life, producing many studies, including Codex on the Flight of Birds (c. 1505), as well as plans for several flying machines, such as a flapping ornithopter and a machine with a helical rotor. In a 2003 documentary by British television station Channel Four, titled Leonardo's Dream Machines, various designs by Leonardo, such as a parachute and a giant crossbow, were interpreted and constructed. Some of those designs proved successful, whilst others fared less well when tested. Similarly, a team of engineers built ten machines designed by Leonardo in the 2009 American television series Doing DaVinci, including a fighting vehicle and a self-propelled cart.\nResearch performed by Marc van den Broek revealed older prototypes for more than 100 inventions that are ascribed to Leonardo. Similarities between Leonardo's illustrations and drawings from the Middle Ages and from Ancient Greece and Rome, the Chinese and Persian Empires, and Egypt suggest that a large portion of Leonardo's inventions had been conceived before his lifetime. Leonardo's innovation was to combine different functions from existing drafts and set them into scenes that illustrated their utility. By reconstituting technical inventions he created something new.\nIn his notebooks, Leonardo first stated the 'laws' of sliding friction in 1493. His inspiration for investigating friction came about in part from his study of perpetual motion, which he correctly concluded was not possible. His results were never published and the friction laws were not rediscovered until 1699 by Guillaume Amontons, with whose name they are now usually associated. For this contribution, Leonardo was named as the first of the 23 \"Men of Tribology\" by Duncan Dowson.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nAlthough he had no formal academic training, many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the \"Universal Genius\" or \"Renaissance Man\", an individual of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination.\" He is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and \"his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote.\" Scholars interpret his view of the world as being based in logic, though the empirical methods he used were unorthodox for his time.\nLeonardo's fame within his own lifetime was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo and his work has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.\nThe continued admiration that Leonardo commanded from painters, critics and historians is reflected in many other written tributes. Baldassare Castiglione, author of Il Cortegiano (The Courtier), wrote in 1528: \"...Another of the greatest painters in this world looks down on this art in which he is unequalled...\" while the biographer known as \"Anonimo Gaddiano\" wrote, c. 1540: \"His genius was so rare and universal that it can be said that nature worked a miracle on his behalf...\" Vasari, in his Lives of the Artists (1568), opens his chapter on Leonardo:\n\nIn the normal course of events many men and women are born with remarkable talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by Heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind, all his actions seem inspired and indeed everything he does clearly comes from God rather than from human skill. Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty, who displayed infinite grace in everything that he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied he solved with ease.\n\nThe 19th century brought a particular admiration for Leonardo's genius, causing Henry Fuseli to write in 1801: \"Such was the dawn of modern art, when Leonardo da Vinci broke forth with a splendour that distanced former excellence: made up of all the elements that constitute the essence of genius...\" This is echoed by A. E. Rio who wrote in 1861: \"He towered above all other artists through the strength and the nobility of his talents.\"\nBy the 19th century, the scope of Leonardo's notebooks was known, as well as his paintings. Hippolyte Taine wrote in 1866: \"There may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, so full of yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries.\"\n\nArt historian Bernard Berenson wrote in 1896: Leonardo is the one artist of whom it may be said with perfect literalness: Nothing that he touched but turned into a thing of eternal beauty. Whether it be the cross section of a skull, the structure of a weed, or a study of muscles, he, with his feeling for line and for light and shade, forever transmuted it into life-communicating values.\nThe interest in Leonardo's genius has continued unabated; experts study and translate his writings, analyse his paintings using scientific techniques, argue over attributions and search for works which have been recorded but never found. Liana Bortolon, writing in 1967, said: Because of the multiplicity of interests that spurred him to pursue every field of knowledge...Leonardo can be considered, quite rightly, to have been the universal genius par excellence, and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term. Man is as uncomfortable today, faced with a genius, as he was in the 16th century. Five centuries have passed, yet we still view Leonardo with awe. The Elmer Belt Library of Vinciana is a special collection at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nTwenty-first-century author Walter Isaacson based much of his biography of Leonardo on thousands of notebook entries, studying the personal notes, sketches, budget notations, and musings of the man whom he considers the greatest of innovators. Isaacson was surprised to discover a \"fun, joyous\" side of Leonardo in addition to his limitless curiosity and creative genius.\nOn the 500th anniversary of Leonardo's death, the Louvre in Paris arranged for the largest ever single exhibit of his work, called Leonardo, between November 2019 and February 2020. The exhibit includes over 100 paintings, drawings and notebooks. Eleven of the paintings that Leonardo completed in his lifetime were included. Five of these are owned by the Louvre, but the Mona Lisa was not included because it is in such great demand among general visitors to the Louvre; it remains on display in its gallery. Vitruvian Man, however, is on display following a legal battle with its owner, the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. Salvator Mundi was also not included because its Saudi owner did not agree to lease the work.\nThe Mona Lisa, considered Leonardo's magnum opus, is often regarded as the most famous portrait ever made. The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time, and Leonardo's Vitruvian Man drawing is also considered a cultural icon.\nMore than a decade of analysis of Leonardo's genetic genealogy, conducted by Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato, came to a conclusion in mid-2021. It was determined that the artist has 14 living male relatives. The work could also help determine the authenticity of remains thought to belong to Leonardo.\n\n\n== Location of remains ==\n\nWhile Leonardo was certainly buried in the collegiate church of Saint Florentin at the Château d'Amboise in 12 August 1519, the current location of his remains is unclear. Much of Château d'Amboise was damaged during the French Revolution, leading to the church's demolition in 1802. Some of the graves were destroyed in the process, scattering the bones interred there and thereby leaving the whereabouts of Leonardo's remains subject to dispute; a gardener may have even buried some in the corner of the courtyard.\nIn 1863, fine-arts inspector general Arsène Houssaye received an imperial commission to excavate the site and discovered a partially complete skeleton with a bronze ring on one finger, white hair, and stone fragments bearing the inscriptions \"EO\", \"AR\", \"DUS\", and \"VINC\" –  interpreted as forming \"Leonardus Vinci\". The skull's eight teeth correspond to someone of approximately the appropriate age, and a silver shield found near the bones depicts a beardless Francis I, corresponding to the king's appearance during Leonardo's time in France.\nHoussaye postulated that the unusually large skull was an indicator of Leonardo's intelligence; author Charles Nicholl describes this as a \"dubious phrenological deduction\". At the same time, Houssaye noted some issues with his observations, including that the feet were turned toward the high altar, a practice generally reserved for laymen, and that the skeleton of 1.73 metres (5.7 ft) seemed too short. Art historian Mary Margaret Heaton wrote in 1874 that the height would be appropriate for Leonardo. The skull was allegedly presented to Napoleon III before being returned to the Château d'Amboise, where they were re-interred in the chapel of Saint Hubert in 1874. A plaque above the tomb states that its contents are only presumed to be those of Leonardo.\nIt has since been theorised that the folding of the skeleton's right arm over the head may correspond to the paralysis of Leonardo's right hand. In 2016, it was announced that DNA tests would be conducted to determine whether the attribution is correct. The DNA of the remains will be compared to that of samples collected from Leonardo's work and his half-brother Domenico's descendants; it may also be sequenced.\nIn 2019, documents were published revealing that Houssaye had kept the ring and a lock of hair. In 1925, his great-grandson sold these to an American collector. Sixty years later, another American acquired them, leading to their being displayed at the Leonardo Museum in Vinci beginning on 2 May 2019, the 500th anniversary of the artist's death.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLeonardo polyhedron\n\n\n== Notes ==\nGeneral\n\nDates of works\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\nEarly\n\nModern\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n==== Early ====\n\n\n==== Modern ====\nBooks\n\nJournals and encyclopedia articles\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSee Kemp (2003) and Bambach (2019, pp. 442–579) for extensive bibliographies\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeneral\n\nUniversal Leonardo, a database of Leonardo's life and works maintained by Martin Kemp and Marina Wallace\nLeonardo da Vinci on the National Gallery website\nWorks\n\nBiblioteca Leonardiana, online bibliography (in Italian)\ne-Leo: Archivio digitale di storia della tecnica e della scienza, archive of drawings, notes and manuscripts\nWorks by Leonardo da Vinci at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by Leonardo da Vinci at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \nComplete text and images of Richter's translation of the Notebooks\nThe Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci",

The book was the 1939 recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Biography. The book received critical acclaim upon release and has been re-released in numerous editions.\n\n\n== Background ==\nVan Doren signed a deal with Viking and received an advance of $3,000 to complete his biography on Benjamin Franklin. Van Doren travelled up and down New England visiting various institutions that housed Franklin's papers to research the book, including the archives at the American Philosophical Society, University of Philadelphia, along with Harvard and Yale University among others. He spent nearly every day exploring these archives for two years searching for information that had not yet been revealed in any Franklin biographies. In an early draft of the book, one of Van Doren's editors felt that the book sourced too many direct quotations from Franklin and suggested they be removed. Van Doren disagreed with this; he thought the quotations improved the writing. The extensive research caused the cost of the book to balloon beyond Van Doren's original advance, so Viking granted Van Doren a second advance of $2,000.  In August 1938 Van Doren was paid a contract of $14,000 ($271,066 as of 2021) for the book's inclusion in the Book-of-the-Month-Club. \nBenjamin Franklin released in September, 1938 to critical and commercial success. With the book's success, Van Doren met with Sidney Howard to discuss a stage adaptation for the book; however, the stage production was canceled after Sidney's tragic death in 1939. In 1940 RKO Pictures purchased the film rights for the book, but the film was never produced. \n\n\n== Contents ==\nBenjamin Franklin is a narrative biography that tells the life story of Franklin through use of his autobiography and many of his essays, letters, the transcripts of events and accounts from other individuals, with additional commentary and criticism provided by Van Doren. Much of the book is expressed through Franklin's own dialog and third-person accounts. Van Doren considered the book a potential continuation of Franklin's autobiography partially in the subject's own words, as the original was never fully completed before his death in 1790. Benjamin Franklin is also considered one of the first truly exhaustive biographical explorations of Franklin's life. The book covers key details and events during Franklin's life in great detail, many times even more so than contemporary Franklin biographies.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBenjamin Franklin received the Pultizer Prize for Biography in 1939. The book was overwhelmingly voted as the best biography of 1938 by 57 critics in the April 22, 1939 issue of The Lewiston Daily Sun.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nFoster, Robin (2018).

In 2015, the book was adapted into the musical Hamilton by playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda. The stage production went on to win numerous accolades, including 11 Tony Awards.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBefore working on Alexander Hamilton, Chernow had previously written multiple books in the topics of business and finance. In 1990, he published The House of Morgan, which covered the life of financier J.P. Morgan and went on to win the National Book Award for Nonfiction. In 1998, he wrote a biography about John D. Rockefeller which remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 16 weeks. In 1999, Chernow shifted his emphasis away from business moguls to start a biography in a new topic, American politics. He later cited his change in focus, \"as a way to broaden my scope, and to stay fresh\" after being inundated with requests for further biographies about Gilded Age industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie and Cornelius Vanderbilt. Therefore, Chernow called Hamilton his \"exit strategy\". This book would allow a foray into constitutional law and foreign policy while still including a large financial dimension.\nChernow began the writing process in 1998 by going through more than 22,000 pages of Hamilton's papers and archival research around the world. He described Hamilton's extensive writing by calling him, \"the human word machine\", saying he \"must have produced the maximum number of words that a human being can scratch out in 49 years\". Over the course of his writing and research, Chernow also took the time to dive deeper into Hamilton's history. He held the dueling pistols used in the famous Burr–Hamilton duel, visited the jail cell on Saint Croix where Hamilton's mother was imprisoned, went to the island of Bequia in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to which Hamilton's father disappeared after abandoning his illegitimate son, and had a lock of Alexander's hair genetically tested for his racial makeup. Chernow explained Hamilton in his book by stating, \"If Washington is the father of the country and Madison the father of the Constitution, then Alexander Hamilton was surely the father of the American government.\"\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nFollowing its release in 2004, Alexander Hamilton was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in biography. In 2005, it won the inaugural $50,000 George Washington Book Prize for early American history. The book spent three months on The New York Times Best Seller list after its release, and then returned to the list in 2015 after the release of Hamilton: An American Musical.\nThe book received positive reviews from both David Brooks and Janet Maslin of The New York Times. Brooks wrote, \"[while] other writers...have done better jobs describing Hamilton's political philosophy, nobody has captured Hamilton himself as fully and as beautifully as Chernow.\" Maslin praised Chernow's biographical ability to \"add a third dimension to conventional views of Hamilton while reaching beyond the limits of a personal portrait\".\nHowever, Benjamin Schwarz, writing for The Atlantic, criticized the book, blaming Chernow's unfamiliarity with revolutionary American politics. While he praised Chernow's earlier biographies about Morgan and Rockefeller, his review of Hamilton stated, \"he's just as obviously not at home in the eighteenth century; his grasp of its religion, attitudes, and intellectual history is unsure, and he lacks command of the ideological, political, sectional, and social differences that divided the early republic.\" Justin Martin, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle additionally thought the book \"dry and speculative,\" as well as slow in pace; \"one can only assume that Chernow, despite his abundant talent, is in the grip of a silly literary convention, namely, that bios of major figures must be very, very long.\"\n\n\n== Stage adaptation ==\nBeginning in 2008, Chernow worked with Lin-Manuel Miranda as the historical consultant to Miranda's newly conceived Broadway production, Hamilton. Miranda had picked up a copy of Chernow's book while on vacation and, after finishing the first few chapters, realized its potential as a musical. Through a mutual friend, Chernow attended a performance of In the Heights where he met with Miranda backstage. Miranda told Chernow that he saw \"hip-hop songs rising off the page\" while reading the biography and wanted his help as a historical consultant for the musical.\nFor six years, Chernow helped guide Miranda through the process of writing Hamilton. The musical debuted on January 20, 2015, at The Public Theater in New York City. It went on to receive a record-setting 16 Tony nominations, winning 11, including Best Musical, and was also the recipient of the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. The musical also won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\nAfter the success of the musical, a paperback edition of Alexander Hamilton was released featuring the musical's logo on its cover. Sales soared from 3,300 copies in 2014 to 106,000 in 2015, and the book returned to The New York Times best-seller list. Likewise, it returned to the list of top 50 best sellers according to USA Today. With its re-release, additional reviews of the biography have appeared, notably in The Guardian and The Times. Following the musical's opening in Europe the book began printing for the first time in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nChernow, Ron (26 April 2004).

Grant, a Union general during the Civil War, served two terms as president, from 1869 to 1877. Chernow asserts that both Grant's command of the Overland campaign and his presidency have been seen in an undeservedly negative light.\n\n\n== Background ==\nChernow had previously written about two Founding Fathers, in a biography of Alexander Hamilton (2004) and George Washington (2010). \"I had always had a fantasy about doing a big, sweeping saga about the Civil War and Reconstruction,\" Chernow said. \"It fascinates me that there are so many Americans who know about the Civil War battles in intimate detail, but they know nothing about Reconstruction.\"\n\nProponents of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, Chernow argues, demonized Grant. His drinking habit, which did not adversely affect his military campaigns, became a central focus of Gilded Age historians. The president was seen poorly for many years, ranked near the bottom among former presidents. Prior to beginning his research for the book, Chernow himself had even bought into the prevailing view; in an earlier biography of John D. Rockefeller, he called Grant \"an inept president\" and described him as \"a small-town businessman before the war, who was enamored of the rich, no matter how frequently they tried to fleece him.\" On reconsideration, Chernow said, \"I think that in the stock market of historical reputations, Grant's stock is definitely rising.\"\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nThe book topped The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller list on the weeks of October 29, 2017, and January 7, 2018.\nJanet Maslin writes for The New York Times that Grant attempts to change Grant's reputation of being \"an inspired commander, an adequate president, a dull companion and a roaring drunk.\" Maslin adds that the book, \"which attempts to see Grant's life as a triumph, is also steeped in tragedy.\" Albert R. Hunt writes for Bloomberg View, \"Chernow definitively establishes that Grant was a great general ... [he] doesn’t gloss over Grant's deficiencies.\"\nFormer President Bill Clinton praised the \"scholarly and literary strengths\" of Chernow's book, as well as how it highlighted the neglected aspects of Grant's presidency, namely protecting the newly freed slaves and their newfound civil rights. For The Washington Post, T. J. Stiles writes, \"[Chernow's] research into Grant's struggles with alcohol would be better if he discussed the scale and intensity of the temperance movement ... Chernow's account of Grant's military career, however, works well, particularly in exploring his closest relationships.\" Stiles further writes that Chernow \"makes little use\" of novel-writing techniques: \"His design does not delight with artful structure\". On the other hand, Adam Gopnik, for The New Yorker, writes, \"[Chernow]'s talent is suited to Grant's story. He writes the way Grant fought: lacking elegance of means, he covers an immense area of ground, thoroughly and relentlessly, capturing his objectives one by one.\"\nDavid Blight wrote that \"Chernow is one of Grant’s affectionate biographers\". Blight noted that Chernow conveys a biographical image of Grant similar to the one Grant himself tried to impose on us in his memoirs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBibliography of Ulysses S.

The book focuses on the creation and use of power in New York local and state politics, as witnessed through Moses's use of unelected positions to design and implement dozens of highways and bridges, sometimes at great cost to the communities he nominally served. The book was critically acclaimed, and has been repeatedly named one of the best biographies of the 20th century, and has been highly influential on city planners and politicians throughout the United States. The book won a Pulitzer Prize in 1975.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe Power Broker describes Robert Moses's strong-willed grandmother and mother before detailing his childhood in Connecticut, studies at Yale and the University of Oxford, and early career promoting progressive reform of New York City's corrupt civil service system. According to Caro, Moses's failures there, and later experience working for future New York Mayor Jimmy Walker in the State Senate and Governor of New York Al Smith taught him how to acquire and wield power to achieve his goals.\nBy the 1930s, Moses was widely admired as a champion for public parks in the city and state. He then led long-sought projects like the Triborough Bridge (later renamed Robert F. Kennedy Bridge), but at the price of his earlier integrity. Caro suggests that Moses's younger, idealistic self would not have been pleased with the ways Moses circumvented limits on his power in his middle and late career, such as creating and expanding New York's public authorities. Moses is portrayed as a bureaucrat who gradually shifted his focus from enacting improvements to exerting control. Because of Moses's positive reputation with citizens, track record of successful projects, and shrewd distribution of contracts, he became crucial to construction and a key figure elected officials depended on. Often, Caro shows, Moses possessed more power than the Mayor, and even the Governor. He consistently favored automobile traffic over mass transit, even ensuring mass transit could not be built in certain areas. Though Moses served in many of his public jobs without compensation (except for New York City Parks Commissioner), he lived lavishly and enabled similar lifestyles for his allies.\nUltimately, Caro presents a complicated picture of Moses. In addition to demonstrating unfavorable aspects of Moses and his work, Caro pays ample tribute to Moses's intelligence, political shrewdness, eloquence, and hands-on, if somewhat aggressive, management style.\nThe book is 1,336 pages long (only two-thirds of the original manuscript), and provides documentation for its assertions in most instances, which Moses and his supporters attempted to refute.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nAs a reporter for Newsday in the early 1960s, Caro wrote a long series about why a proposed bridge across Long Island Sound from Rye to Oyster Bay, championed by Moses, would have been inadvisable. It would have required piers so large as to disrupt tidal flows in the sound, among other problems. Caro believed that his work had influenced even the state's powerful governor Nelson Rockefeller to reconsider the idea, until he saw the state's Assembly vote overwhelmingly to pass a preliminary measure for the bridge.\n\"That was one of the transformational moments of my life,\" Caro said years later. It led him to think about Moses for the first time. \"I got in the car and drove home to Long Island, and I kept thinking to myself: 'Everything you've been doing is baloney. You've been writing under the belief that power in a democracy comes from the ballot box. But here's a guy who has never been elected to anything, who has enough power to turn the entire state around, and you don't have the slightest idea how he got it.'\"\nIn 1966, Caro's wife Ina changed the topic of her graduate thesis to write about the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, while Caro was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University taking courses in urban planning and land use. He found that academics' notions of highway planning contrasted with what he had seen as a reporter. \"Here were these mathematical formulas about traffic density and population density and so on,\" he recalled, \"and all of a sudden I said to myself: 'This is completely wrong. This isn't why highways get built. Highways get built because Robert Moses wants them built there. If you don't find out and explain to people where Robert Moses gets his power, then everything else you do is going to be dishonest.'\"\nHe found that despite Moses's illustrious career, no biography had been written, save the highly flattering and propagandistic Builder for Democracy in 1952. So he decided to undertake the task himself, beginning the seven-year process of hundreds of interviews meticulously documented as well as extensive original archival research, listed in the notes on sources in an appendix.\nOriginally, Caro believed it would take nine months to research and write the book. He received a yearlong Carnegie fellowship to work on a biography of Moses, and quickly ran out of money.  As that time stretched into years, he ran out of money and despaired of ever finishing it. Ina, his wife and research assistant, sold the family home on Long Island and moved the Caros to an apartment in the Bronx where she had taken a teaching job, so that her husband could continue.\nMoses \"did his best to try to keep this book from being written—as he had done, successfully, with so many previous, stillborn, biographies.\" After Caro had been working on the book for more than a year, Moses agreed to sit for a series of seven interviews, one lasting from 9:30 A.M. until evening, providing much material about his early life, but when Caro began asking questions (as he later wrote, \"for having interviewed others involved in the subjects in question and having examined the records—many of them secret—dealing with them, it was necessary to reconcile the sometimes striking disparity between what he told me and what they told me\") the series of interviews was abruptly terminated.\"\nCaro's final manuscript ran to about 1,050,000 words. Editor Robert Gottlieb told him that the maximum possible length of a trade book was about 700,000 words, or 1,280 pages. When Caro asked about splitting the book into two volumes, Gottlieb replied that he \"might get people interested in Robert Moses once. I could never get them interested in him twice.\" So Caro had to cut down his manuscript, which took him months.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Power Broker generated substantial public discussion upon publication, especially after the \"One Mile\" chapter ran as an excerpt in The New Yorker. The chapter highlighted the difficulties in constructing one section of the Cross-Bronx Expressway and the way Moses ran roughshod over the interests of residents and businesses of the section of East Tremont the road effectively destroyed. Before publication, Caro, largely unknown at the time, challenged the magazine's legendary editor, William Shawn, over his changes to Caro's prose. It was common for the magazine to edit excerpts to conform to its house style. This did not make allowance for many of the author's narrative flourishes, such as single-sentence paragraphs. Caro also complained that much of his work had been compressed.\n\nThe book won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography in 1975, as well as the Francis Parkman Prize awarded by the Society of American Historians to the book that best \"exemplifies the union of the historian and the artist.\" On June 12, 1975, The New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects conferred a \"Special Citation upon Robert Caro ... for reminding us once again, that ends and means are inseparable.\" In 1986, it was recognized by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and in 2001, the Modern Library selected it as one of the 100 most important books of the 20th century. In 2005, Caro was awarded the Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2010, President Barack Obama, after awarding Caro a National Humanities Medal, said \"I think about Robert Caro and reading The Power Broker back when I was 22 years old and just being mesmerized, and I'm sure it helped to shape how I think about politics.\" In 2010, Caro was inducted into the New York State Writers Hall of Fame. David Klatell, former interim dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, recommended the book to new students to familiarize themselves with New York City and the techniques of investigative reporting.\n\n\n=== Response from Moses ===\nMoses and his supporters considered the book to be overwhelmingly biased against him, and what his supporters considered to be a record of unprecedented accomplishment. Moses put out a 23-page typed statement challenging some of its assertions (for instance, he claimed he never used the anti-Italian slurs the book attributes to him about Fiorello La Guardia).\n\n\n=== 21st century re-assessment ===\nDefenses of Moses's career, including museum exhibits and a 2007 book with a \"revisionist theme running throughout\" (Robert Moses and the Modern City) have emerged in explicit reaction to The Power Broker. In 2014, Caro reminisced about his seven years' labor on the book in The New York Times Sunday Book Review.\n\nThe book remains highly regarded. In 2017, David W. Dunlap described The Power Broker as \"the book that still must be read – 43 years after it was published – to understand how New York really works.\" In 2020, the book made frequent appearances as the \"ultimate signifier of New York political sophistication\" on the bookshelves of U.S. journalists and politicians appearing in TV interviews from their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several New York politicians, including city comptroller Brad Lander, City Council member Justin Brannan, state senators Zellnor Myrie and Jessica Ramos, and former Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer, have claimed to have read the book. For the 50th anniversary of the book's publication, the New-York Historical Society hosted an exhibit about The Power Broker in late 2024.\nIn the book Caro claims Moses built overpasses crossing his Long Island Parkways low in height to keep buses from transporting those without private automobiles (i.e. lower class, disproportionately non-white citizens) to the beaches and parks he developed as president of the Long Island State Park Commission. German professor of sociology Bernward Joerges pointed out in 1999 that \"Moses did nothing different on Long Island from any parks commissioner in the country\" in designing bridges too low for buses to pass under. Cornell city planning professor Thomas Campanella, in turn, measured the overpasses and found that they were \"substantially lower on the Moses parkway\" than elsewhere.\n\n\n=== E-book edition ===\nFifty years following the first publication, an e-book edition was finally released. Caro had resisted offering a digital edition, but was finally convinced to agree to the release of an e-book because of the potential to appeal to new readers who would prefer the convenience of a digital edition, something that was particularly attractive for the 1,286-page four-pound-plus (1.8 kg) volume.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of New York City\nMotherless Brooklyn, a 2019 film partly inspired by The Power Broker\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCaro's retrospective New Yorker article on the writing of the book (1998)\nWNYC conversation with Caro about the book on the 40th anniversary of its publication (2014)\nPresentation by Caro on \"New York Politics In The Mid 1900's\", February 18, 1998, C-SPAN\nPresentation by Caro on The Power Broker, September 28, 1998, C-SPAN\nPresentation by Caro on The Power Broker, February 11, 2007, C-SPAN",

    "description": "The Years of Lyndon Johnson is a multi-book biography of Lyndon B. Johnson by the American writer Robert Caro. Four volumes have been published, running to more than 3,000 pages in total, detailing Johnson's early life, education, and political career. A fifth volume, which is currently being written, is expected to deal with the bulk of Johnson's presidency and post-presidential years. The series is published by Alfred A. Knopf.\n\n",
    "full_narrative": "The Years of Lyndon Johnson is a multi-book biography of Lyndon B. Johnson by the American writer Robert Caro. Four volumes have been published, running to more than 3,000 pages in total, detailing Johnson's early life, education, and political career. A fifth volume, which is currently being written, is expected to deal with the bulk of Johnson's presidency and post-presidential years. The series is published by Alfred A. Knopf.\n\n\n== Book One: The Path to Power (1982) ==\nIn the first volume, The Path to Power, Caro retraces Johnson's early life growing up in the Texas Hill Country and working in Washington, D.C. first as a congressional aide and then as a congressman.  Caro's research included renting a house in the Hill Country for three years, living there much of that time, to interview numerous people who knew Johnson and his family, and to better understand the environment in which Johnson had grown up. This volume covers Johnson's life through his failed 1941 campaign for the United States Senate.\nThis book was released on November 12, 1982. It won the 1982 National Book Critics Circle Award. It was a finalist for the 1983 National Book Award, hardcover autobiography or biography.\n\n\n== Book Two: Means of Ascent (1990) ==\nIn the second volume, Means of Ascent, Caro detailed Johnson's life from the aftermath of Johnson's first bid for the U.S. Senate in 1941 to his election to the Senate in 1948. Much of the book deals with Johnson's bitterly contested Democratic primary against Coke R. Stevenson in that year and the Box 13 scandal. The book was released on March 7, 1990.\n\n\n== Book Three: Master of the Senate (2002) ==\n\nIn the third volume, Master of the Senate, Caro chronicles Johnson's rapid ascent in the United States Congress from 1948 to 1958,  including his tenure as Senate majority leader. This 1,167-page work examines in particular Johnson's battle to pass a landmark civil rights bill through Congress without it tearing apart his party, whose southern bloc was anti-civil rights while the northern faction was more supportive of civil rights. Although its scope was limited, the ensuing Civil Rights Act of 1957 was the first such legislation since the Reconstruction era.\nThe book was released on April 23, 2002. It won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, the 2002 National Book Award for Nonfiction, the 2002 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Biography, and the 2002 D.B. Hardeman Prize.\n\n\n== Book Four: The Passage of Power (2012) ==\nIn the fourth volume, The Passage of Power, Caro covers Johnson's life from 1958 to 1964, including the presidential primary against Kennedy, the challenges Johnson faced upon his assumption of the presidency, and the significant accomplishments in the months after Kennedy's assassination.\nThe 736-page book was released on May 1, 2012.\nIt won the National Book Critics Circle Award (2012; Biography), the Los Angeles Times Book Prize (2012; Biography), the Mark Lynton History Prize (2013), the American History Book Prize (2013) and the Biographers International Organization's Plutarch Award (2013). It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Nonfiction (2012). It was selected as one of Time magazine's Best Books of the Year (non-fiction #2). It was ranked by the New York Times as #73 in its list of the 100 best books of the 21st century in 2024.\n\n\n== Book Five ==\nIn November 2011, Caro estimated that the fifth and final volume—expected to treat the remainder of Johnson's presidency and his life thereafter—would require another two to three years to write. In March 2013, he affirmed a commitment to completing the series with a fifth volume. As of April 2014, he was continuing to research the book. In a televised interview with C-SPAN in May 2017, Caro confirmed over 400 typed pages as being complete, covering the period 1964–65; and that once he completes the section on Johnson's 1965 and 1966 legislative achievements, he intends to move to Vietnam to continue the writing process.\nIn an interview with the New York Review of Books in January 2018, Caro said that he was writing about 1965 and 1966 and a non-chronological section about the relationship between Johnson and Bobby Kennedy. Asked if he still planned to visit Vietnam soon, Caro replied: \"Not yet, no. This is a very long book. And there's a lot to do before that's necessary. I'm getting close to it now.\" In December 2018, it was reported that Caro is still \"several years from finishing\" the volume. In January 2020, Caro said he had \"typed 604 manuscript pages so far\" and is \"currently on a section relating to the creation of Medicare in 1965\". Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Caro postponed his research trip to Vietnam and a visit to the Johnson Presidential Library, but continued work on the book from his home in Manhattan. In October 2021, Caro said that he was writing about Johnson's passing of Medicare and his escalation of the Vietnam War.  In December 2022, Caro related that he still hoped to conduct research in Vietnam. Robert Gottlieb, Caro’s editor for more than fifty years, died in June 2023; a spokesperson for Caro said that he was “continuing his work on Volume 5 with limited interruption”.\nIn a September 2024 interview for the 50th anniversary of his book The Power Broker, Caro revealed that he was steadily making progress on the fifth book, but was re-writing sections related to the Civil Rights movement and Martin Luther King Jr. and still had a substantial amount of work to finish when it came to writing about the Vietnam War. He also revealed in separate interviews that he had completed sections related to Medicare and was receiving digital versions of Vietnam-era documents from the Johnson Presidential Library.\nCaro provided a few more updates in a February 2025 interview with Smithsonian magazine, where he revealed that he had written 980 pages for his manuscript. He also revealed that he was still working on sections for the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, from its management from Senator Russell Long to its passage through the Senate, and that he planned on embarking his trip to Vietnam once he finished those sections. He also clarified that while he will not allow someone else to finish his work, he will release whatever he's completed to the public if he does pass away.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThroughout the biography, Caro examines the acquisition and use of political power in American democracy, from the perspective both of those who wield it and those who are at its mercy. In an interview with Kurt Vonnegut and Daniel Stern, he once said: \"I was never interested in writing biography just to show the life of a great man,\" saying he wanted instead \"to use biography as a means of illuminating the times and the great forces that shape the times—particularly political power.\"\n\n\n== Translation ==\nThere are plans for a Chinese translation of the series, collectively known under the title Lindeng Yuehanxun, published by Beijing-based Xiron Books. Chengdu resident He Yujia took four months to translate the first volume. She had not learned a significant amount of information about Lyndon Johnson in her formal education, and in accordance with her usual approach to translating non-fiction, she translated material as she read it instead of reading the entire work and then translating it. In late 2018, she spent four months translating the second volume, Jinjie zhi Ti (\"Means of Ascent\"), but as of 2020 the publisher still has not released the translation, nor has He Yujia received financial remuneration for her work. Peter Hessler argued that this could be related to a decline in China-United States relations.\n\n\n== Influence of the series ==\nPoliticians have responded strongly to The Years of Lyndon Johnson:\n\nBill Clinton, former President of the United States, wrote of The Passage of Power: \"In sparkling detail, Caro shows the new president's genius for getting to people—friends, foes and everyone in between—and how he used it to achieve his goals.\"\nWalter Mondale, a former US vice president, described Master of the Senate as a \"superb work of history.\"\nRichard Nixon, Johnson's immediate successor as President of the United States, called The Path to Power a \"terrible book\", expressing disbelief at its popularity and saying \"it makes [Johnson] feel like a goddamn animal ... of course, he was.\"\nGordon Brown, a former British prime minister, said of the series: \"It's a wonderfully written set of books. The stories are quite breathtaking. ... These books challenge the view of history that politics is just about individual maneuvering. It's about ideas and principled policy achievements. That's what makes it one of the great political biographies.\"\nWilliam Hague, a former British Conservative Party leader and foreign secretary, nominated Means of Ascent as the book he would most like to have with him on a desert island, in the BBC Radio 4 program Desert Island Discs. He later wrote: \"I explained that it was the best political biography of any kind, that I had ever read. I said it conveyed more brilliantly than any other publication what it really feels like to be a politician. ... When a fourth volume finally completes the set, this will be nothing short of a magnificent history of 20th century America.\"\nMichael Howard, another former Conservative Party leader, encountered the series after swapping houses with Caro for a holiday. He said, \"For Caro, writing a biography is writing a thriller—in Johnson's case, a Western. You can't stop turning the pages. He doesn't like Johnson, but the facts are there so you can make your own judgments. I can't recommend this book highly enough.\"\nBeau Willimon, who created the American version of the political drama television series House of Cards, said he had drawn inspiration for the series from The Years of Lyndon Johnson. In the last episode of the first season, a copy of The Passage of Power can be seen lying on the desk of protagonist Frank Underwood.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAll the Way – play\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCaro, Robert A., The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to Power. 1982.

    "full_narrative": "The Bully Pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism is a 909-page historical nonfiction book written by Doris Kearns Goodwin that was published by Simon & Schuster in November 2013. The book centers on the relationship of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft and the activities of investigative journalists who impacted on public opinion during the Progressive Era. Upon its release, the book received positive reviews, with reviewers praising the research and readability, and won several accolades.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Bully Pulpit is the seventh book by Doris Kearns Goodwin. She spent seven years researching the book. Goodwin stated that initially she wished to write a history of the Progressive Era and Theodore Roosevelt, but determined Taft to be \"far more sympathetic if flawed\" than she first considered, which resulted in the book centering around the evolving relationship of Roosevelt and William Howard Taft.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\nThe book covers the Progressive Era that transformed the United States at the turn of the century, and centers on the relationship of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft as key players along with their wives, Edith Roosevelt and Nellie Taft, which evolved from friendship to rivalry. In parallel, it chronicles the activities of a group of writers working for McClure's magazine, such as Ida Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens, who helped influence public opinion with their investigative journalism focusing on the increasing power of \"trusts\" and their associated abuses of power. The book also describes a perception of America that is different from our modern day perception.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Bully Pulpit received positive reviews upon its release. Bill Keller from The New York Times praised the \"rich and elegant language\", and description of the relationships of other leaders, journalists and cabinet members with Roosevelt and Taft that resulted in \"most of her men and women with personality\" and for the story to \"come together like a well-wrought novel\". He also commented positively on the usage of detailed newspapers, magazines, and letters. This sentiment was shared by Publishers Weekly, which awarded a starred review, complimenting its relevance and the usage of quotes and letters used to show \"[t]he complex relationship and soured political camaraderie between Roosevelt and Taft\". Reviewing for the Booklist, Jay Freeman also gave a starred review, and described it as a \"superb re-creation of a period when many politicians, journalists, and citizens of differing political affiliations viewed government as a force for public good\". Another Booklist review by Alan Moores praised the book's details on Roosevelt and accessibility. Similarly, John Steele Gordon complimented that the book \"amply demonstrates\" Roosevelt's personality and the differences between him, its readability, research, as well as the Goodwin \"touchingly describing\" their meeting in 1918. Kirkus Reviews also gave a starred review, praising the book's coverage on investigative journalism and concluded that it was [a] notable, psychologically charged study in leadership\". \nBill Gates also recommend the book in his 2014 Summer Reading List, commenting positively on the theme of social change in the book. It also received several accolades, including the 2014 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction and 2013 Booklist Editors' Choice for Adult Books.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBully pulpit\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

    "full_narrative": "Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption is a 2010 non-fiction book by Laura Hillenbrand.  Unbroken is a biography of World War II veteran Louis Zamperini, a former Olympic track star who survived a plane crash in the Pacific Theater, spent 47 days drifting on a raft, and then survived more than two and a half years as a prisoner of war (POW) in three Japanese POW camps.\nUnbroken spent more than four years on The New York Times best seller list, including 14 weeks at number one. It is the 5th longest-running nonfiction best seller of all time.\n\n\n== Background ==\nInspired by the story Come on SeaBiscuit in childhood, as an adult Hillenbrand wrote Seabiscuit: An American Legend (2001). While researching that novel, Hillenbrand came across a 1938 newspaper article about Zamperini. The discovery led Hillenbrand to tell the story of Zamperini's experience as a prisoner of war (POW) during World War II. “Unbroken” (2010) became a New York Times Bestseller and formed the basis for a feature film.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nZamperini grows up in a Christian home. In his youth, he is a troublemaker in his hometown of Torrance, California, stealing and stashing food, liquor, and cigarettes. He is also bullied for his Italian background.\nZamperini is caught by law enforcement and returned to his family. Although his father disciplines him with beatings, his behavior does not improve.\nCoached by his older brother, Pete, Zamperini soon begins to pursue running. Pete rides a bicycle alongside Louis as he runs home from school, ringing the bike bell as encouragement. This positive reinforcement changes Zamperini, who then joins his high school track team. Subsequently, he begins to win races, and becomes known as the Torrance Tornado. Training at a college track facility, Louis becomes acquainted with James Sasaki, a man he presumes to be Japanese-American.\nIn 1936, Zamperini earns a place on the U.S. Olympic Team to compete in the Berlin Olympic Games. Pete walks his younger brother to the train station for his departure to Germany. At the station, Zamperini says that this first Olympic Games will just be a “try-out” for the next Olympics 4 years later in Tokyo, Japan. Pete tells Louis to never forget that “a moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory”.\nAt the Olympics, Zamperini participates in the opening ceremonies as the Olympic Torch is lit, and notices a Japanese contestant who politely nods at him. Competing in the 5,000 meter race against more experienced athletes, Zamperini first seems to fall behind. As the second lap bell rings, he remembers Pete’s words and rallies to place 8th with a time of 14 minutes, 46.8 seconds.\nFollowing the start of World War II, Zamperini’s running career abruptly ends. He enlists in the United States Army Air Corps and becomes a bombardier, and is subsequently assigned to the Pacific theater to a squadron based in the Hawaiian Islands. Zamperini and his crew grow close during this time.\nWhen his plane, the Super-Man, bombs a Japanese target, it is hit over five hundred times. Despite failed brakes, the crew is able to crash land at their air field. All but one of the crew survive the ordeal.\nAs he awaits his next mission, Zamperini continues to train, trying to beat his own record. His crew’s aircraft is replaced with a less reliable plane, the Green Hornet. While Zamperini’s crew understands that the Green Hornet is an unreliable plane, his superiors insist that it is flight-worthy.\nWhen his crew is assigned a search mission, Zamperini observes that their mission involves “a lot of ocean”. The Green Hornet crashes due to mechanical difficulties 850 miles (1,370 km) south of Oahu, killing eight of the 11 men aboard. \nThe survivors, Louis Zamperini, Phil, and Mac, are wounded and face a grave future. Phil becomes seriously depressed. Mac goes through various mental breakdowns and eats all the chocolate rations.\nThe survivors also become creative, devising ways to obtain fresh water and food. After the first day at sea, they attempt to signal a plane with no luck. The men are able to capture an albatross. When they attempt to eat it, they become ill. Instead, they use the meat of the bird for fish bait. When they catch and eat a fish raw, Phil remarks that the Japanese eat their fish raw.\nAware of past records for survival at sea, the survivors carefully track the passage of time. Phil recalls that another air crew that was stranded at sea for 24 days. To pass time and maintain sanity, Zamperini talks about his mother’s cooking.\nBy Day 18, Zamperini and Phil both seriously question their unfortunate fate. During a terrible storm, Zamperini prays, promising God that he will dedicate his life to Him.\nOn their 28th day at sea, the survivors signal a plane. The enemy plane makes two strafing runs, damaging both life rafts. Zamperini and Phil manage to repair a life raft. Mac dies soon after.\nLouie and Phil survive 46 days at sea and are captured by the Japanese. They are first taken to a small base camp, given an insufficient meal, and subjected to interrogation.\nAfter a few days, both men are made to strip. Their guards hose them down and shave their hair in preparation for transfer to POW camps. Phil and Zamperini are separated. Placed on a bus blindfolded, Zamperini speaks to another POW named Tinker, Zamperini asks “Is this Tokyo, I’ve always wanted to go to Tokyo”. Tinker replies “Be careful what you wish for”.\nAt the POW camp, a camp leader nicknamed “The Bird” introduces himself to the new arrivals. The Bird states that the POWs are enemies of Japan and shall be treated accordingly. Zamperini glances at the Bird who then orders Zamperini to look at him but beats Zamperini whenever he does so. \nIn their barracks, the other POWs recognizes the wounds on Zamperini as the work of the Bird. The POWs explain that the nickname “The Bird” refers to their tormentor’s way of constantly watching and listening.\nDuring one of their morning “trainings”, the Bird calls out Zamperini as an Olympic athlete and forces him to race against one of the camp guards. When the weakened Zamperini loses, he is beaten and called a failure in order to demoralize him. \nIn a talk with a senior POW, Zamperini expresses that he would rather be killed than watch others be tortured. The reply is that “the only way to beat them would be to make it out alive”.\nJapanese officers tell Zamperini that everyone in America thinks he is dead. Zamperini is offered a deal: in return for speaking on the radio to announce that he is alive and well, Zamperini could spend a day outside the camp. During this time, Zamperini recognizes one of the Japanese officers as none other than James Sasaki, an acquaintance during training as a track athlete at a college in the USA.\nAfter Zamperini goes through with the initial broadcast, the Japanese offer him an opportunity to take part in propaganda broadcasts in exchange for a more comfortable life outside of the camp. Zamperini experiences profound discomfort at the sight of other clean and well-dressed American personnel taking part in this kind of collaboration with the Japanese.\nWhen Zamperini declines, he is sent back to the camp. The Bird sets out to punish Zamperini. One punishment involves other prisoners punching Zamperini in the face.\nWhen the camp comes under attack, the prisoners are moved to a coal production facility and told to work or be killed. Zamperini spends weeks at the camp, but when he rests briefly, he is taken away to be punished.\nThe Bird orders Zamperini to hold a large beam over his head under threat of death. Zamperini endures for 37 minutes and stares down the Bird until the Bird snaps and severely beats Zamperini.\nAs the war comes to an end, the camp guards scatter and American planes drop food and other supplies to the POWs. Eventually, Zamperini returns to the United States. Upon his return to the United States, Zamperini kisses the ground.\nZamperini is reunited with his family. He meets Cynthia Applewhite and they marry after knowing each other for two months. They have a daughter. However, traumatized by his wartime ordeal, without a career, and unable to pursue his love of running, Zamperini becomes an alcoholic. Cynthia seeks a divorce.\nWhen evangelist Billy Graham comes to town, Cynthia convinces Zamperini to attend a revival meeting. There Zamperini recalls his bargain while lost at sea and the bargain that he made with God. Zamperini is inspired to turn his life around, which saves his marriage.\nOver time, Zamperini forgives all who wronged him during WWII. Zamperini returns to Japan where he locates and makes peace with many of his former tormentors. When the Bird refuses to meet him, Zamperini sends him a letter to express his forgiveness.\nZamperini takes part in the torch relay for the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano.

There is also a street in Indian Trail, North Carolina named after him.\n\n\n== Early days ==\n\nSeabiscuit was foaled in Lexington, Kentucky, on May 23, 1933, from the mare Swing On and sire Hard Tack, a son of Man o' War. Seabiscuit was named for his father; \"sea biscuit\" is another name for hardtack, a type of cracker eaten by sailors.\nThe bay colt grew up on Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, where he was trained. He was undersized, knobby-kneed, and given to sleeping and eating for long periods.\nInitially, Seabiscuit was owned by the powerful Wheatley Stable and trained by \"Sunny Jim\" Fitzsimmons, who had taken Gallant Fox to the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. Fitzsimmons saw some potential in Seabiscuit but felt the horse was too lazy. Fitzsimmons devoted most of his time to training Omaha, who won the 1935 Triple Crown.\nSeabiscuit was relegated to a heavy schedule of smaller races. He failed to win any of his first 17 races, usually finishing back in the field. After that, Fitzsimmons did not spend much time on him, and the horse was sometimes the butt of stable jokes. However, Seabiscuit began to gain attention after winning two races at Narragansett Park and setting a new track record in the second—Claiming Stakes race.\nAs a two-year-old, Seabiscuit raced 35 times (a heavy racing schedule), coming in first five times and finishing second seven times. These included three claiming races, in which he could have been purchased for $2,500, but he had no takers.\nWhile Seabiscuit had not lived up to his racing potential, he was not the poor performer Fitzsimmons had taken him for. His last two wins as a two-year-old came in minor stakes races. The next season started with a similar pattern. The colt ran 12 times in less than four months, winning four times. One of those races was a cheap allowance race on the \"sweltering afternoon of June 29,\" 1936, at Suffolk Downs. That was where trainer Tom Smith first laid eyes on Seabiscuit. His owners sold the horse to automobile entrepreneur Charles S. Howard for $8,000 at Saratoga, in August.\n\n\n== 1936/1937: The beginning of success ==\n\nHoward assigned Seabiscuit to a new trainer, Tom Smith, who, with his unorthodox training methods, gradually brought Seabiscuit out of his lethargy. Smith paired the horse with Canadian jockey Red Pollard (1909–1981), who had experience racing in the West and in Mexico. On August 22, 1936, they raced Seabiscuit for the first time. Improvements came quickly, and in their remaining eight races in the East, Seabiscuit and Pollard won several times, including the Detroit Governor's Handicap (worth $5,600) and the Scarsdale Handicap ($7,300) at Empire City Race Track in Yonkers, New York.\nIn early November 1936, Howard and Smith shipped the horse to California by rail. His last two races of the year were at Bay Meadows racetrack in San Mateo, California. The first was the $2,700 Bay Bridge Handicap, run over one-mile (1.6 km). Despite starting badly and carrying the top weight of 116 pounds (53 kg), Seabiscuit won by five lengths. At the World's Fair Handicap (Bay Meadows' most prestigious stakes race), Seabiscuit led throughout.\nIn 1937, the Santa Anita Handicap, California's most prestigious race, was worth over $125,000 ($2.9 million in 2010) to the winner; it was known colloquially as \"The Hundred Grander.\" In his first warm-up race at Santa Anita Park, Seabiscuit won easily. In his second race of 1937, the San Antonio Handicap, he suffered a setback after he was bumped at the start and then pushed wide; Seabiscuit came in fifth, losing to Rosemont.\nThe two met again in the Santa Anita Handicap a week later, where Rosemont won by a nose. The defeat was devastating to Smith and Howard and was widely attributed in the press to a jockey error. Pollard, who had not seen Rosemont over his shoulder until too late, was blind in one eye due to an accident during a training ride, a fact he had hidden throughout his career. A week after this defeat Seabiscuit won the San Juan Capistrano Handicap by seven lengths in track record time of 1:484⁄5 for the 1+1⁄8 mile event.\nSeabiscuit was rapidly becoming a favorite among California racing fans, and his fame spread as he won his next three races. With his successes, Howard decided to ship the horse east for its more prestigious racing circuit.\nSeabiscuit's run of victories continued. Between June 26 and August 7, he ran five times, each time in a stakes race, and each time he won under steadily increasing handicap weights (imposts) of up to 130 pounds (59 kg). For the third time, Seabiscuit faced off against Rosemont again, this time beating him by seven lengths. On September 11, Smith accepted an impost of 132 pounds (60 kg) for the Narragansett Special at Narragansett Park. On race day, the ground was slow and heavy, and unsuited to \"the Biscuit\", carrying the heaviest burden of his career. Smith wanted to scratch, but Howard overruled him. Never in the running, Seabiscuit finished third. His winning streak was snapped, but the season was not over; Seabiscuit won his next three races (one a dead heat) before finishing the year with a second-place at Pimlico.\nIn 1937, Seabiscuit won 11 of his 15 races and was the year's leading money winner in the United States. However, War Admiral, having won the Triple Crown that season, was voted the most prestigious honor, the American Horse of the Year Award.\n\n\n== Early five-year-old season ==\n\nIn 1938, as a five-year-old, Seabiscuit's success continued. On February 19, Pollard suffered a terrible fall while racing on Fair Knightess, another of Howard's horses. With half of Pollard's chest caved in by the weight of the fallen horse, Howard had to find a new jockey. After trying three, he settled on George Woolf, an already successful rider and old friend of Pollard's.\nWoolf's first race aboard Seabiscuit was the Santa Anita Handicap, \"The Hundred Grander\" the horse had narrowly lost the previous year. Seabiscuit was drawn on the outside, and at the start was impeded by another horse, Count Atlas, angling out. The two were locked together for the first straight, and by the time Woolf disentangled his horse, they were six lengths off the pace. Seabiscuit worked his way to the lead but lost in a photo finish to the fast-closing Santa Anita Derby winner, Stagehand (owned by Maxwell Howard, not related to Charles), who had been assigned 30 pounds (14 kg) less than Seabiscuit.\nThroughout 1937 and 1938, the media speculated about a match race between Seabiscuit and the seemingly invincible War Admiral (sired by Man o' War, Seabiscuit's grandsire). The two horses were scheduled to meet in three stakes races, but one or the other was scratched, usually due to Seabiscuit's dislike of heavy ground. After extensive negotiation, the owners organized a match race for May 1938 at Belmont, but Seabiscuit was scratched.\nBy June, Pollard had recovered, and on June 23, he agreed to work a young colt named Modern Youth. Spooked by something on the track, the horse broke rapidly through the stables and threw Pollard, shattering his leg and seemingly ending his career.\nHoward arranged a match race for Seabiscuit against Ligaroti, a highly regarded horse owned by the Hollywood entertainer Bing Crosby and Howard's son, Lindsay, through Binglin Stable, in an event organized to promote Crosby's resort and Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California. With Woolf aboard, Seabiscuit won that race, despite persistent fouling from Ligaroti's jockey. After three more outings and with only one win, he was scheduled to go head-to-head with War Admiral in the Pimlico Special in November, in Baltimore, Maryland.\nSent to race on the East Coast, on October 16, 1938, Seabiscuit ran second by two lengths in the Laurel Stakes to the filly Jacola, who set a new Laurel Park Racecourse record of 1:37.00 for one mile.\n\nOn November 1, 1938, Seabiscuit met War Admiral and jockey Charles Kurtsinger in what was dubbed the \"Match of the Century.\" The event was run over 1+3⁄16 miles (1.9 km) at Pimlico Race Course. From the grandstands to the infield, the track was jammed with fans. Trains were run from all over the country to bring fans to the race, and the estimated 40,000 at the track were joined by 40 million listening on the radio. War Admiral was the favorite (1–4 with most bookmakers) and a nearly unanimous selection of the writers and tipsters, excluding a California contingent.\nHead-to-head races favor fast starters, and War Admiral's speed from the gate was well known. Seabiscuit, on the other hand, was a pace stalker, skilled at holding with the pack before pulling ahead with late acceleration. From the scheduled walk-up start, few gave him a chance to lead War Admiral into the first turn. Smith knew these things and trained Seabiscuit to run against this type, using a starting bell and a whip to give the horse a Pavlovian burst of speed from the start.\nWhen the bell rang, Seabiscuit broke in front, led by over a length after 20 seconds, and soon crossed over to the rail position. Halfway down the backstretch, War Admiral started to cut into the lead, gradually pulling level with Seabiscuit, then slightly ahead. Following advice he had received from Pollard, Woolf had eased up on Seabiscuit, allowing his horse to see his rival, then asked for more effort. Two hundred yards from the wire, Seabiscuit pulled away again and continued to extend his lead over the closing stretch, finally winning by four lengths despite War Admiral running his best time for the distance.\nAs a result of his races that year, Seabiscuit was named American Horse of the Year for 1938, beating War Admiral by 698 points to 489 in a poll conducted by the Turf and Sport Digest magazine. Seabiscuit was the number one newsmaker of 1938. The only major prize that eluded him was the Santa Anita Handicap.\n\n\n== Injury and return ==\nSeabiscuit was injured during a race. Woolf, who was riding him, said that he felt the horse stumble. The injury was not life-threatening, although many predicted Seabiscuit would never race again. The diagnosis was a ruptured suspensory ligament in the front left leg. With Seabiscuit out of action, Smith and Howard concentrated on their horse Kayak II, an Argentine stallion.  In the spring of 1939, Seabiscuit covered seven of Howard's mares, all of which had healthy foals in spring of 1940.  One, Fair Knightess's colt, died as a yearling.\nSeabiscuit and a still-convalescing Pollard recovered together at Howard's ranch, with the help of Pollard's new wife Agnes, who had nursed him through his initial recovery. Slowly, both horse and rider learned to walk again (Pollard joked that they \"had four good legs between\" them). Poverty and his injury had brought Pollard to the edge of alcoholism. A local doctor broke and reset Pollard's leg to aid his recovery, and slowly Pollard regained the confidence to sit on a horse. Wearing a brace to stiffen his atrophied leg, he began to ride Seabiscuit again, first at a walk and later at a trot and canter. Howard was delighted at their improvement, as he longed for Seabiscuit to race again, but was extremely worried about Pollard, as his leg was still fragile.\nOver the fall and winter of 1939, Seabiscuit's fitness seemed to improve by the day. By the end of the year, Smith was ready to return the horse to race training, with a collection of stable jockeys in the saddle. By the time of his comeback race, Pollard had cajoled Howard into allowing him the ride. After the horse was scratched due to soft going, the pair finally lined up at the start of the La Jolla Handicap at Santa Anita, on February 9, 1940. Seabiscuit was third, beaten by two lengths. By their third comeback race, Seabiscuit was back to his winning ways, running away from the field in the San Antonio Handicap to beat his erstwhile training partner, Kayak II, by two and a half lengths. Under 124 pounds (56 kg), Seabiscuit equalled the track record for a mile and 1/16.\n\nOne race was left in the season. A week after the San Antonio, Seabiscuit and Kayak II both took the gate for the Santa Anita Handicap and its $121,000 prize. Seventy-eight thousand paying spectators crammed the racetrack, most backing Seabiscuit. Pollard found his horse blocked almost from the start. Picking his way through the field, Seabiscuit briefly led. As they thundered down the back straight, Seabiscuit became trapped in third place, behind leader Whichcee and Wedding Call on the outside.\nTrusting in his horse's acceleration, Pollard steered between the leaders and burst into the lead, taking the firm ground just off the rail. As Seabiscuit showed his old surge, Wedding Call and Whichcee faltered, and Pollard drove his horse on, taking \"The Hundred Grander\" by a length and a half from the fast-closing Kayak II under jockey Leon Haas. Pandemonium engulfed the course. Neither horse and rider, nor trainer and owner, could get through the crowd of well-wishers to the winner's enclosure for some time.\n\n\n== Retirement, later life, and offspring ==\nOn April 10, 1940, Seabiscuit's retirement from racing was officially announced. When he was retired to the Ridgewood Ranch near Willits, California, he was horse racing's all-time leading money winner. Put out to stud, Seabiscuit sired 108 foals, including two moderately successful racehorses: Sea Sovereign and Sea Swallow. Over 50,000 visitors went to Ridgewood Ranch to see Seabiscuit in those seven years before his death in 1947.\n\n\n== Death and interment ==\nSeabiscuit died of a probable heart attack on May 17, 1947, in Willits, California, six months before his grandsire Man o' War. He is buried at Ridgewood Ranch in Mendocino County, California.\n\n\n== Legacy and honors ==\n\n\n=== Awards and honorable distinctions ===\n1938 American Horse of the Year\nIn 1958, Seabiscuit was voted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\nIn the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century (1999), Seabiscuit was ranked 25th. War Admiral was 13th, and Seabiscuit's grandsire and War Admiral's sire, Man o' War, placed 1st.\n\n\n=== Portrayals in film and television ===\n\n\n==== Documentaries ====\nAmerican Experience: \"Seabiscuit\" (April 21, 2003)) is a documentary episode that aired as Season 15, Episode 11 of the PBS American Experience series.\nESPN SportsCentury: \"Seabiscuit\" (November 17, 2003), Seabiscuit was featured on ESPN's SportsCentury Greatest Athletes series.\nThe True Story of Seabiscuit (July 27, 2003) is a 45-minute made-for-TV documentary directed by Craig Haffner, written by Martin Gillam, and containing interviews and footage with William H.

    "full_narrative": "Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster is a 1997 bestselling nonfiction book written by Jon Krakauer. It details Krakauer's experience in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which eight climbers were killed and several others were stranded by a storm. Krakauer's expedition was led by guide Rob Hall. Other groups were trying to summit on the same day, including one led by Scott Fischer, whose guiding agency, Mountain Madness, was perceived as a competitor to Hall's agency, Adventure Consultants.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nKrakauer describes the events leading up to his eventual decision to participate in an Everest expedition in May 1996, despite having mostly given up mountain climbing years before. Krakauer was a journalist for the adventure magazine Outside, and initially his intention to climb Everest had been purely professional. He had planned to climb only as far as the mountain's base camp, and to report on the commercialization of the mountain. However, the idea of going to Everest reawakened his childhood desire to climb the mountain. Krakauer asked his editor to put off publishing the story for a year so that he could train for a climb to the summit. \nFrom there, the book moves between describing events that took place on the mountain, and the unfolding tragedy, which occurs during the push to the summit. The 1996 disaster saw eight recorded deaths, including that of Krakauer's guide, Rob Hall. This is currently the third-highest recorded number of deaths on the mountain in a single day, with the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches causing the most at over 20. Krakauer concludes that essential safety methods that had been adopted over the years by experienced guides on Everest were sometimes compromised by the competition between rival guiding agencies to get their respective clients to the summit.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nKrakauer's recounting of certain aspects of the climb generated criticism, both from some of the climb's participants and from fellow mountaineers such as Galen Rowell. Much of the criticism centers on Krakauer's account of how Anatoli Boukreev, an experienced Kazakh high-altitude climber and guide for Scott Fischer, had handled the climb. Boukreev had descended the summit before his clients did, ostensibly out of concern for their safety, in order to prepare for potential rescue efforts. Although Krakauer acknowledged that Boukreev's efforts after descending the mountain were heroic (he engaged in repeated solo rescue efforts, saving at least two climbers' lives), he questioned Boukreev's judgment during the climb, in particular his decision to descend from the summit ahead of his clients, his decision not to use supplementary oxygen, his choices of gear on the mountain and his interactions with clients. The author also acknowledged Boukreev's aforementioned accelerated descent excuse (ahead of his clients), 'in preparedness of potential rescue,' but questioned how feasible a coordinated rescue would have been executed without radio-relay (since Boukreev was without a radio, when he returned to camp). Boukreev provided a rebuttal to most of these claims in his 1997 book, The Climb.\nMountaineer Galen Rowell criticized Krakauer's account, citing numerous inconsistencies in his narrative, and observed that Krakauer had been asleep in his tent while Boukreev was rescuing other climbers. Rowell argued that not only were Boukreev's actions heroic but his judgment was also prescient: “[Boukreev] foresaw problems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak [Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond to an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke.\"\nMountaineer Graham Ratcliffe  criticized Krakauer's account, for omitting to mention that the teams on Everest in May 1996 were receiving – and sharing – accurate daily weather forecasts from weather services in England and Denmark, and knew about the impending storm.\nIn Krakauer's 1999 paperback edition of Into Thin Air, he addresses some of the criticisms in a detailed postscript.\n\n\n== Adaptation ==\nFilm rights for Into Thin Air were purchased by Sony almost immediately after the book's publication. The book was adapted into the TV movie Into Thin Air: Death on Everest (1997), starring Peter Horton as Scott Fischer and Christopher McDonald as Krakauer. The book and the film both contain the same strong editorial viewpoint regarding the fundamental causes of the tragedy, although the film differs sharply from the book in details regarding responsibility.\nThe 2015 film Everest, by director Baltasar Kormákur, depicts the same events as the book, with actor Michael Kelly portraying Krakauer. According to Kormákur, it is not based on Krakauer's book.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of people who died climbing Mount Everest\nAfter the Wind, a 2014 book by Lou Kasischke\nThe Climb, a 1997 book by Anatoli Boukreev\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBoukreev, Anatoli; DeWalt, G.

These forecasts highlighted clearly the oncoming strong storm that struck the mountain on 10th/11th May causing the tragedy. While most of Ratcliffe's comments are directed towards the two expedition leaders for ignoring the forecasts and continuing on the summit attempts, thereby exposing clients to such high risk, he also makes clear that in his view, Krakauer and many others' description of the storm as \"sudden and unexpected\" is wholly inaccurate.

Brenda was married to Allen Lafferty, the youngest of the Lafferty brothers. His older brothers Dan and Ron disapproved of their sister-in-law Brenda because they believed she was the reason Dan's wife left him (after refusing to allow him to marry a plural/second wife—his stepdaughters). Both men's extremism reached new heights when they became members of the School of the Prophets, founded and led by Robert C. Crossfield. After joining this group, Ron claimed that God had sent him revelations about Brenda. Communication with God is a core belief of fundamentalist Mormonism, as well as the mainstream LDS Church. Ron showed the members of the School of Prophets a written \"removal revelation\" that allegedly called for the killing of Brenda and her baby. After other members of the School failed to honor Ron's removal revelation, the brothers quit the School.\nDan claimed that he slit both of the victims' throats. But, at the 2001 trial, Chip Carnes, who was riding in the getaway car, testified that Ron said that he had killed Brenda, and that Ron had thanked his brother for \"doing the baby\".\nAfter the murders, the police found the written \"revelation\" concerning Brenda and Erica. The press widely reported that Ron had received a revelation to kill the mother and child. Afterward, the Lafferty brothers conducted a recorded press conference at which Ron said that the \"revelation\" was not addressed to him, but to \"Todd\" [a drifter whom Ron had befriended while working in Wichita] and that the revelation called only for \"removal\" of Brenda and her baby, and did not use the word \"kill\". The jury at Ron's trial was shown these remarks of Ron denying he had received a revelation to kill Brenda and Erica.\n\n\n=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints history ===\nAfter opening with the Lafferty case, Krakauer explores the history of Mormonism, starting with the early life of Joseph Smith, founder and first prophet of the Latter Day Saint movement. He follows his life from a criminal fraud trial to leading the first followers to Jackson County, Missouri, and Nauvoo, Illinois. While violence seemed to accompany the Mormons, Krakauer notes that they did not necessarily initiate it. Early Mormons faced religious persecution from mainstream Protestant Christians, due to their unorthodox beliefs, including polygamy and ongoing revelation from God through living prophets. In addition they tended to conduct business and personal relations only with other members of their community. There were violent clashes between Mormons and non-Mormons, culminating in Smith's death on June 27, 1844, when a mob shot him after attacking him in Carthage Jail, where he was awaiting trial for inciting a riot after ordering, as Nauvoo's mayor, in conjunction with the City Council, the destruction of the printing press of the Nauvoo Expositor, a local publication which had been declared a public nuisance.\nFrom Nauvoo, the Mormons trekked westward to modern-day Utah, led by Smith's successor Brigham Young (after some controversy). Arriving in what they called Deseret, many Mormons believed they would be left alone by the United States government, as the territory was then part of Mexico. Soon after their arrival, the Mexican–American War occurred, with Mexico's eventual defeat. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo signed on February 2, 1848, this land and the rest of what would become the American Southwest were ceded to the United States.\nSmith's highly controversial revelation of plural marriage threatened to split apart followers of the faith. The Utah Territory was a theodemocracy led by Brigham Young as Governor, where polygamy continued to be practiced for 43 years. Finally, on September 23, 1890, Wilford Woodruff, the fourth president of the Church, claimed to have received a revelation from God (known as the 1890 Manifesto) which officially banned polygamy. Six years later, Utah was granted statehood.\nAfter the Manifesto, some members broke away from the mainstream church to form what eventually became the FLDS Church, the most popular group of fundamentalist Mormonism. The FLDS Church continues to encourage polygamy, as do some other breakaway groups.\n\n\n=== Comparisons ===\nKrakauer examines events in Latter Day Saint history and compares them to modern-day FLDS doctrine (and other minority versions of Mormonism, such as the Crossfield School of the Prophets). He examines the 1857 Mountain Meadows massacre during the Utah War, in which Mormons and some local Paiute Indians rounded up and murdered approximately 120 members of the Baker–Fancher party of emigrants passing through their territory. These early Mormons went to great lengths to conceal their part in the massacre (including dressing as the Paiute and painting their faces in similar fashion). The Civil War interrupted investigations of the events, and no one was indicted until 1874, when nine men were charged. For nearly two decades the falsehood held that the massacre was due solely to the Paiute. The only person ever convicted in the affair was John D. Lee, a former member of the LDS Church. He was convicted and executed by the state in 1877 for his role in the crime.\nKrakauer cites information gleaned from several interviews with Dan Lafferty and former and current members of the Crossfield School of the Prophets, as well as other fundamentalist Mormons. He refers to several histories about the formation of Mormonism to tie the origins of the religion to the modern iterations of both the church and the fundamentalists.\n\n\n== Derivation of the title ==\nThe title of the book is drawn from an 1880 address by John Taylor, the third president of the LDS Church, defending the practice of plural marriage:\n\nGod is greater than the United States, and when the Government conflicts with heaven, we will be ranged under the banner of heaven against the Government. The United States says we cannot marry more than one wife. God says different.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCharles Graeber of The Guardian listed the book in his top ten true crime books, and described Krakauer as \"a master journalist and storyteller who is unfettered and unafraid of the true crime mantle. [He] pries open the golden doors to one of the newest and fastest-growing religions in America to set the stage for the non-fiction drama.\"\nIn advance of the book's release in 2003, Richard E. Turley, managing director of the Church History Department of the LDS Church, argued that the book contained historical errors and incorrect assertions, and showed \"unfamiliarity with basic aspects\" of the Church's history, theology and administrative structure, and criticized the work for lacking a \"scientific methodology\". He accused Krakauer of \"condemn[ing] religion generally\". In his 2004 paperback edition of the book, Krakauer responded to these allegations, noting that Turley's pre-emptive \"response\" preceded the book's release, and claimed that LDS leaders had explicitly advocated the whitewashing of LDS history, amongst other points.\nMike Otterson, managing director of public affairs for the LDS Church, condemned Krakauer's example of religious \"zealots\" to draw conclusions about all Mormons and any propensity for violence. Otterson said that, after reading the book, \"One could be forgiven for concluding that every Latter-day Saint, including your friendly Mormon neighbor, has a tendency to violence. And so Krakauer unwittingly puts himself in the same camp as those who believe every German is a Nazi, every Japanese a fanatic, and every Arab a terrorist.\"\n\n\n== Television adaptation ==\n\nIn July 2011, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to the book, with Ron Howard directing and Dustin Lance Black writing the screenplay. In June 2021, it was announced that the book was being redeveloped as a limited series for FX, with Black still attached as writer, David Mackenzie serving as director, and Andrew Garfield, Gil Birmingham and Daisy Edgar-Jones to star. The series debuted in April 2022 on FX on Hulu.\n\n\n== Related documentary ==\nIn 2015, Amy Berg released her independent documentary, Prophet's Prey, about fundamentalist Mormons practicing polygamy, based on the case of Warren Jeffs, sentenced to life for polygamy and abuse of minors. Krakauer participated in this film and appears on camera, as he continued his own investigation of sects that practiced polygamy. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, both working on the television adaptation of the book as producers, were also executive producers of the documentary.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Doubleday Website for Under the Banner of Heaven (Retrieved 22-2-2008).\nBookbrowse.com Reading Guides.\nNew York Times Review\nThe Controversy between the Laffertys and the School of the Prophets",

In his review article, he wrote: \"Peter Thiel's new book, Zero to One, shines like a laser beam.

But much more than that, it's also a lucid and profound articulation of capitalism and success in the 21st century economy\" and \"it's surprising in a wonderful way just how simple Zero to One feels. Barely 200 pages long, and well lit by clear prose and pithy aphorisms, Thiel has written a perfectly tweetable treatise and a relentlessly thought-provoking handbook\".\nPublishers Weekly wrote of the book: \"Thiel touches on how to build a successful business, but the discussion is too abstract to offer much to the next Steve Jobs—or Peter Thiel.\"\nIn November 2014, Timothy B. Lee reviewed the book for Vox.com, writing that although Thiel's book contained some good advice, he made the advice sound more contrarian than it really was, did not provide sufficiently concrete advice, and made some questionable claims.\nIn The New Atlantis, James Poulos compares Thiel to Friedrich Nietzsche and argues Thiel, \"the most political and theoretical of the supernerds,\" writes esoterically in Zero to One, when he \"raises the prospect of a remarkably comprehensive failure among our best and brightest.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

He further states that investing in the portfolio of the 11 companies covered by the book, in the year of 2001, would actually result in underperforming the S&P 500. Levitt concludes that books like this are \"mostly backward-looking\" and can't offer a guide for the future.\"\nJohn Greathouse alleges in a critical review that Collins once made a comment stating, \"The books never promised that these companies would always be great, just that they were once great.\" Greathouse claims the statement was an attempt by Collins to defend the book, and other previous works. Greathouse also represents the view that Collins' book How the Mighty Fall: And Why Some Companies Never Give In blames some of the failed companies themselves for having drastically changed after Collins' books were printed.\nPhil Rosenzweig describes errors in the fundamental research assumptions of Good to Great. First, heavy reliance on magazine articles as research introduce sources littered with halo effects. He also notes the Wrong End of the Stick delusion used in the hedgehog claims of the book in that successful companies have a luxury of focus which is not possible for less successful companies. Finally, he notes the presence of the Organizational Physics delusion in that Collins does not carefully avoid confusing correlation with causation. \n\n\n== Similar books ==\n\nBuilt to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies by James C.

First published in 1989, the book goes over Covey's ideas on how to spur and nurture personal change. He also explores the concept of effectiveness in achieving results, as well as the need for focus on character ethic rather than the personality ethic in selecting value systems. As named, his book is laid out through seven habits he has identified as conducive to personal growth.\n\n\n== The seven habits ==\n\nThe book is laid out through seven habits. Covey intends the first three as a means of achieving independence, the next three as a means of achieving interdependence, and the last, seventh habit as a means to maintain the previous.\n\n\n=== Be proactive ===\nProactivity is about taking responsibility for one's reaction to one's own experiences, taking the initiative to respond positively and improve the situation. Covey postulates, in a discussion of the work of psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, that between stimulus and response lies a person's ability to choose how to react, and that nothing can hurt a person without the person's consent. Covey discusses recognizing one's circle of influence and circle of concern. Covey discusses focusing one's responses and focusing on the center of one's influence.\n\n\n=== Begin with the end in mind ===\nCovey discusses envisioning what one wants in the future (a personal mission statement) so one can work and plan towards it, and understanding how people make important life decisions. To be effective one needs to act based on principles and constantly review one's mission statements, says Covey. He asks: Are you – right now – who you want to be? What do you have to say about yourself? How do you want to be remembered? If habit 1 advises changing one's life to act and be proactive, habit 2 advises that \"you are the programmer\". Grow and stay humble, Covey says.\nCovey says that all things are created twice: Before one acts, one should act in one's mind first. Before creating something, measure twice. Do not just act; think first: Is this how I want it to go, and are these the correct consequences?\n\n\n=== Put first things first ===\n\nCovey talks about what is important versus what is urgent. Priority should be given in the following order:\n\nQuadrant I. Urgent and important (Do) – important deadlines and crises\nQuadrant II. Not urgent but important (Plan) – long-term development\nQuadrant III. Urgent but not important (Delegate) – distractions with deadlines\nQuadrant IV. Not urgent and not important (Eliminate) – frivolous distractions\nThe order is important, says Covey: after completing items in quadrant I, people should spend the majority of their time on II, but many people spend too much time in III and IV. The calls to delegate and eliminate are reminders of their relative priority.\nIf habit 1 advises that \"you are the programmer\", habit 2 advises: \"write the program, become a leader\", and habit 3 ”follow the program”. Keep personal integrity by minimizing the difference between what you say versus what you do, says Covey.\n\n\n=== Think win–win ===\nSeek mutually beneficial win–win solutions or agreements in your relationships, says Covey. Valuing and respecting people by seeking a \"win\" for all is ultimately a better long-term resolution than if only one person in the situation gets their way. Thinking win–win isn't about being nice, nor is it a quick-fix technique; it is a character-based code for human interaction and collaboration, says Covey.\n\n\n=== Seek first to understand, then to be understood ===\n\nUse empathetic listening to genuinely understand a person, which compels them to reciprocate the listening and take an open mind to be influenced. This creates an atmosphere of caring and positive problem-solving.\nHabit 5 is expressed in the ancient Greek philosophy of three modes of persuasion: \n\nEthos is one's personal credibility. It's the trust that one inspires, one's \"emotional bank account\".\nPathos is the empathetic side, the alignment with the emotional trust of another person's communication.\nLogos is the logic, the reasoning part of the presentation.\nThe order of the concepts indicates their relative importance, says Covey.\n\n\n=== Synergize ===\nCombine the strengths of people through positive teamwork, so as to achieve goals that no one could have done alone, Covey exhorts.\n\n\n=== Sharpen the saw ===\n\nCovey says that one should balance and renew one's resources, energy, and health to create a sustainable, long-term, effective lifestyle. He primarily emphasizes exercise for physical renewal, good prayer, and good reading for mental renewal. He also mentions service to society for spiritual renewal.\nCovey explains the \"upward spiral\" model. Through conscience, along with meaningful and consistent progress, an upward spiral will result in growth, change, and constant improvement. In essence, one is always attempting to integrate and master the principles outlined in The 7 Habits at progressively higher levels at each iteration. Subsequent development on any habit will render a different experience and one will learn the principles with a deeper understanding. The upward spiral model consists of three parts: learn, commit, do. According to Covey, one must continue consistently educating the conscience with increasing levels in order to grow and develop on the upward spiral. The idea of renewal by education will propel one along the path of personal freedom, security, wisdom, and power, says Covey.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAt the end of 1994, U.S. President Bill Clinton invited Covey, along with other authors, to Camp David to counsel him on how to integrate the book's ideas into his presidency.\nIn August 2011, Time listed 7 Habits as one of \"The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books\".\nUpon Covey's death in 2012, the book had sold more than 20 million copies.\n\n\n== Formats and adaptations ==\nIn addition to the book and audiobook versions, a VHS version also exists.\nIn 1998, Stephen's son, Sean Covey, wrote a version of the book for teens, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens, which simplifies the 7 habits for younger readers to make them easier to understand. This was later followed by The 6 Most Important Decisions You Will Ever Make: A Guide for Teens (2006), which highlights key times in the life of a teen and gives advice on how to deal with them, and The 7 Habits of Happy Kids (2008), a children's book illustrated by Stacy Curtis that further simplifies the 7 habits for children and teaches them through stories with anthropomorphic animal characters.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Stephen Covey homepage",

Over 30 million copies have been sold worldwide, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.\nCarnegie had been conducting business education courses in New York since 1912.

The revised edition reduced the number of sections from six to four, eliminating sections on effective business letters and improving marital satisfaction. In 2011, it was number 19 on Time's list of the 100 most influential Nonfiction books.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nBefore How to Win Friends and Influence People was released, the genre of self-help books had an ample heritage. Authors such as Orison Swett Marden and Samuel Smiles had enormous success with their self-help books in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nDale Carnegie began his career teaching night classes at a YMCA in New York, later expanding to YMCAs in Philadelphia and Baltimore. He then taught independently at hotels in London, Paris, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, writing small booklets to go along with his courses. After one of his 14-week courses, he was approached by publisher Leon Shimkin of the publishing house Simon & Schuster. Shimkin urged Carnegie to write a book, but he was not initially persuaded. Shimkin then hired a stenographer to type up what he heard in one of Carnegie's long lectures and presented the transcript to Carnegie, who edited and revised it into a final form.\nTo market the book, Shimkin sent 500 copies of the book to former graduates of the Dale Carnegie Course, with a note that pointed out the utility of the book for refreshing students with the advice they had learned. The 500 mailed copies brought orders for over 5,000 more copies of the book and Simon & Schuster had to increase the original print order of 1,200 quickly. Shimkin also ran a full-page ad in the New York Times complete with quotes by Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller on the importance of human relations.\nOriginally published in November 1936, the book reached the New York Times best-seller list by the end of the year, and did not fall off for the next two years. Simon & Schuster continued to advertise the book relying heavily on testimonials as well as the testable approach the book offered.\n\n\n== 1981 edition ==\nThe 1981 edition of How to Win Friends and Influence People is broken into the following parts: \"Twelve Things This Book Will Do For You\", \"Fundamental Techniques in Handling People\", \"Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking\", and \"Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment\". The 1936 edition also contained \"Letters That Produced Miraculous Results\" and \"Seven Rules for Making Your Home Life Happier\".\nSince the original release, examples and stories used in the books were adjusted to remain more relevant. Newer editions have only 4 parts to the book, including \"Fundamental Techniques in Handling People\", \"Six Ways to Make People Like You\", \"How to Win People to Your way of Thinking\", and \"Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People became one of the most successful books in American history. It went through 17 print editions in its first year of publishing and sold 250,000 copies in the first three months. The book has sold over 30 million copies worldwide since and annually sells in excess of 250,000 copies. A 2013 Library of Congress survey ranked Carnegie's volume as the seventh most influential book in American history.\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People was number eight on the list of \"Top Check Outs Of All Time\" by the New York Public Library.\nAfter How to Win Friends and Influence People was published in November 1936 and ascended rapidly on best-seller lists, the New York Times reviewed it in February 1937. They offered a balanced criticism, arguing that Carnegie indeed offered insightful advice in dealing with people, but that his wisdom was extremely simple and should not overrule the foundation of actual knowledge.\nThe satirical writer Sinclair Lewis waited a year to offer his scathing critique. He described Carnegie's method as teaching people to \"smile and bob and pretend to be interested in other people's hobbies precisely so that you may screw things out of them.\" However, despite the criticism, sales continued to soar and the book was talked about and reviewed as it rapidly became mainstream.\nScholarly critique was little and oscillated over time. Due to the book's lay appeal, it was not significantly discussed in academic journals. In the early stages of the book's life, the few scholarly reviews that were written explained the contents of the book and attempted to describe what made the book popular. As time passed, however, scholarly reviews became more critical, chiding Carnegie for being insincere and manipulative.\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People was written for a popular audience and Carnegie successfully captured the attention of his target. The book experienced mass consumption and appeared in many popular periodicals, including garnering 10 pages in the January 1937 edition of Reader's Digest.\nThe book continued to remain at the top of best-seller lists and was even noted in the New York Times to have been extremely successful in Nazi Germany, much to the writer's bewilderment. It was written that Carnegie would rate \"butter higher than guns as a means of winning friends\" something \"diametrically opposite to the official German view.\"\nCarnegie described his book as an \"action-book\" but it is today categorized as one of the first in the self-help genre. Almost every self-help book since has borrowed some type of style or form from Carnegie's \"path-breaking best seller.\"\n\n\n== Major sections and points ==\n\n\n=== Twelve Things This Book Will Do For You ===\nThis section was included in the original 1936 edition as a single page list, which preceded the main content of the book, showing a prospective reader what to expect from it. The 1981 edition omits points 6 to 8 and 11.\n\nGet you out of a mental rut, give you new thoughts, new visions, new ambitions.\nEnable you to make friends quickly and easily.\nIncrease your popularity.\nHelp you to win people to your way of thinking.\nIncrease your influence, your prestige, your ability to get things done.\nEnable you to win new clients, new customers.\nIncrease your earning power.\nMake you a better salesman, a better executive.\nHelp you to handle complaints, avoid arguments, keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant.\nMake you a better speaker, a more entertaining conversationalist.\nMake the principles of psychology easy for you to apply in your daily contacts.\nHelp you to arouse enthusiasm among your associates.\nThe book has six major sections. The core principles of each section are quoted below.\n\n\n=== Fundamental Techniques in Handling People ===\nDon't criticize, condemn, or complain.\nGive honest and sincere appreciation.\nArouse in the other person an eager want.\n\n\n=== Six Ways to Make People Like You ===\nBecome genuinely interested in other people.\nSmile.\nRemember that a person's name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\nBe a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.\nTalk in terms of the other person's interest.\nMake the other person feel important – and do it sincerely.\n\n\n=== Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking ===\nThe only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.\nShow respect for the other person's opinions. Never say \"You're Wrong.\"\nIf you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.\nBegin in a friendly way.\nStart with questions to which the other person will answer yes.\nLet the other person do a great deal of the talking.\nLet the other person feel the idea is his or hers.\nTry honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.\nBe sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.\nAppeal to the nobler motives.\nDramatize your ideas.\nThrow down a challenge.\n\n\n=== Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment ===\nBegin with praise and honest appreciation.\nCall attention to people's mistakes indirectly.\nTalk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.\nAsk questions instead of giving direct orders.\nLet the other person save face.\nPraise every improvement.\nGive the other person a fine reputation to live up to.\nUse encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.\nMake the other person happy about doing what you suggest.\n\n\n=== Letters That Produced Miraculous Results ===\nThis section was included in the original 1936 edition but omitted from the revised 1981 edition.\n\nIn this chapter, notably the shortest in the book, Carnegie analyzes two letters and describes how to appeal to someone's vanity with the term \"do me a favor\" as opposed to directly asking for something which does not offer the same feeling of importance to the recipient of the request.\n\n\n=== Seven Rules For Making Your Home Life Happier ===\nThis section was included in the original 1936 edition but omitted from the revised 1981 edition.\n\nDon't nag.\nDon't try to make your partner over.\nDon't criticize.\nGive honest appreciation.\nPay little attentions.\nBe courteous.\nRead a good book on the sexual side of marriage.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nWarren Buffett took the Dale Carnegie course \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" when he was 20 years old, and to this day has the diploma in his office.\nThe book is said to have greatly influenced the life of television and film actress Donna Reed. It was given to her by her high school chemistry teacher Edward Tompkins to read as a sophomore at Denison (Iowa) High School in 1936. Upon reading it, she won the lead in the school play, was voted Campus Queen, and was in the top 10 of the 1938 graduating class.\nCharles Manson used what he learned from the book in prison to manipulate others into killing on his behalf.\nDuring the 1998 kidnapping of LDS missionaries in Saratov, Russia, the kidnapped missionaries used strategies from the book in an attempt for leniency from their captors.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDale Carnegie Training",

    "full_narrative": "The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, first published in 1997, is the best-known work of the Harvard professor and businessman Clayton Christensen. It expands on the concept of disruptive technologies, a term he coined in a 1995 article \"Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave\". It describes how large incumbent companies lose market share by listening to their customers and providing what appears to be the highest-value products, but new companies that serve low-value customers with poorly developed technology can improve that technology incrementally until it is good enough to quickly take market share from established business. Christensen recommends that large companies maintain small, nimble divisions that attempt to replicate this phenomenon internally to avoid being blindsided and overtaken by startup competitors.\n\n\n== Subject matter ==\nClayton Christensen demonstrates how successful, outstanding companies can do everything \"right\" and still lose their market leadership, or even fail, as new, unexpected competitors rise and take over the market. This dilemma has two key parts:\n\nValue to innovation is an S-curve: Improving a product takes time and many iterations. The first of these iterations provide minimal value to a customer, but in time the base is created and the value increases exponentially. Once the base is created, then each iteration is dramatically better than the last. At some point, the most valuable improvements are complete and the value per iteration becomes minimal again. So in the middle is the most value, at the start and end the value is minimal.\nIncumbent sized deals: An incumbent has the luxury of a large customer set, and expectations of high yearly sales. New entry next generation products find niches away from the incumbent customer set to build the new product. The new entry companies do not need the yearly sales of the incumbent and thus have more time to focus and innovate on this smaller venture.\nFor this reason, the next generation product is not being built for an incumbent's customer set and this large customer set is not interested in the new innovation and keeps demanding more innovation with the incumbent product. Unfortunately, this incumbent innovation is limited to the overall value of the product as it is at the latter end of the S-curve. Meanwhile, the new entrant is deep into the S-curve and providing significant value to the new product. By the time the new product becomes interesting to the incumbent's customers it is too late for an incumbent to react to the new product. At this point it is too late for an incumbent to keep up with the new entrant's rate of improvement, which by then is on the near-vertical part of its S-curve trajectory.\nBased on this multi-industry study, Christensen introduces the theory of \"disruptive innovation\", popularising the idea in business parlance.\nChristensen then argues that the following are common principles that incumbents must address:\n\nResource dependence: Current customers drive a company's use of resources\nSmall markets struggle to impact an incumbent's large market\nDisruptive technologies have fluid futures, as in, it is impossible to know what they will disrupt once matured\nIncumbent organizations' value is more than simply their workers, it includes their processes and core capabilities which drive their efforts\nTechnology supply may not equal market demand. The attributes that make disruptive technologies unattractive in established markets are often the ones that have the greatest value in emerging markets\nHe also argues the following strategies assist incumbents in succeeding against the disruptive technology:\n\nThey develop the disruptive technology with the \"right\" customers. Not necessarily their current customer set\nThey place the disruptive technology into an autonomous organization that can be rewarded with small wins and small customer sets\nThey fail early and often to find the correct disruptive technology\nThey allow the disrupting organization to use all of the company's resources when needed but are careful to make sure the processes and values were not those of the company\n\n\n== Reception ==\nShortly after the release of the book, it received the Global Business Book Award as the best business book of the year (1997). The Economist also named it as one of the six most important books about business ever written\".\n\n\n== Impact on business world ==\nThe term disruptive technologies was first described in depth with this book by Christensen; but the term was later changed to disruptive innovation in a later book (The Innovator's Solution). A disruptive innovation is an innovation that creates a new market and value network that will eventually disrupt an already existing market and replace an existing product.\n\n\n== Recent work ==\nSince the book was published, various articles have been written, both critiquing and supporting Clayton Christensen's work.\nThe Innovator's Dilemma proved popular: it was reprinted, \nand a follow-up book titled The Innovator's Solution was published. \nHis books Disrupting Class about education\nand The Innovator's Prescription about health care both use ideas from The Innovator's Dilemma.\nAn empirical study replicated the Innovator's Dilemma's main prediction that incumbents innovate less than entrants in a study of the hard disk industry. It found the main reason for the comparable lack of innovation by incumbents lies in the reduced incentives to innovate due to product cannibalization.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJill Lepore, \"What the Theory of 'Disruptive Innovation' Gets Wrong\", The New Yorker, June 23, 2014.\nIgami, Mitsuru (2017). \"Estimating the Innovator's Dilemma: Structural Analysis of Creative Destruction in the Hard Disk Drive Industry, 1981–1998\".

It was released on March 15, 2010, by W. W. Norton & Company. It spent 28 weeks on The New York Times best-seller list, and was the basis for the 2015 film of the same name.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe Big Short describes several of the main players in the creation of the credit default swap market who sought to bet against the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bubble and thus ended up profiting from the 2008 financial crisis. It also highlights the eccentric natures of people who bet against the market or otherwise \"go against the grain.\"\nThe book follows people who believed the housing bubble was going to burst—including Meredith Whitney, who predicted the demise of Citigroup and Bear Stearns; Steve Eisman, an outspoken hedge fund manager; Greg Lippmann, a Deutsche Bank trader; Eugene Xu, a quantitative analyst who created the first CDO market by matching buyers and sellers; the founders of Cornwall Capital, who started a hedge fund in their garage with $110,000 and built it into $120 million when the market crashed; and Michael Burry, an ex-neurologist who created Scion Capital.\nIt also highlights some of the people involved in the biggest losses in the market crash: Wing Chau, Merrill's $300 million mezzanine CDO manager; Howie Hubler, known as the person who lost $9 billion in one trade, the fifth-largest single loss in history; and Joseph Cassano's AIG Financial Products, which suffered more than $99 billion in losses.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Big Short was shortlisted for the 2010 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award. It spent 28 weeks on The New York Times' non-fiction bestseller list. It also received the 2011 Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Book Award.\n\n\n== Film ==\n\nParamount acquired the rights to The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine in 2013. On March 24, 2014, it was announced that Adam McKay would direct the adaptation. On January 13, 2015, Variety reported that Brad Pitt, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling were set to star in the film, and that Pitt would produce it with McKay and Dede Gardner. Steve Carell then joined. Plan B Entertainment financed the film with Paramount handling the distribution rights.\nProduction started March 23, 2015 in New Orleans, LA. The film was released on December 11, 2015, and was met with critical acclaim, winning the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCDO-Squared\nCollateralized debt obligation\nCredit default swap\nMortgage-backed security\nThe Greatest Trade Ever, a 2009 book by Gregory Zuckerman\nThe Smartest Guys in the Room, a 2003 book by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Big Short, at W.

    "full_narrative": "Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt is a book by the American writer Michael Lewis, published by W. W. Norton & Company on March 31, 2014. The book is a non-fiction investigation into the phenomenon of high-frequency trading (HFT) in the US financial market, with the author interviewing and collecting the experiences of several individuals working on Wall Street. Lewis concludes that HFT is used as a method to front run orders placed by investors. He goes further to suggest that broad technological changes and unethical trading practices have transformed the U.S. stock market from \"the world's most public, most democratic, financial market\" into a \"rigged\" market.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nFlash Boys maintains a primary focus on Brad Katsuyama and other central figures in the genesis and early days of IEX, the Investors' Exchange. Sergey Aleynikov, a former programmer for Goldman Sachs, serves as a secondary focus.\nThe introduction begins by naming Aleynikov and describing his arrest, along with the author's personal history on Wall Street, as the impetus for writing the book. The first chapter tells the story of a $300 million project from Spread Networks that was underway in mid-2009—the construction of an 827-mile (1,331 km) fiber-optic cable that cuts straight through mountains and rivers from Chicago to New Jersey—with the sole goal of reducing the transmission time for data from 17 to 13 milliseconds.\nLewis goes on to describe the modern world of electronic trading and how it differs from the past—when trading was mostly performed in open outcry pits on physical trading floors—and how that change has impacted the market. The speed of data is a major theme in the book; the faster a market participant's computer system can receive and act on data, the better their edge, and opportunity to profit, with even nanoseconds making a difference.\nThe central story details financial executive Brad Katsuyama's discovery of how access to this fiber-optic cable—as well as other technologies and special arrangements between HFT firms, exchanges, and large Wall Street banks—presents an opportunity for those insider institutions to profit at the expense of retail investors. To counter this, Katsuyama bands together a team that sets out to develop a new exchange, called IEX, designed specifically to prevent the unfair advantage enjoyed by HFT firms in the rest of the market.\nThe final chapter is dedicated to the tribulation of Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer twice prosecuted and twice acquitted for a single act of allegedly copying proprietary computer source code from his employer before joining a competing firm.\nThe epilogue details the author's bicycle journey to observe a string of microwave towers along the same stretch as Spread Networks' fiber-optic line. Lewis notes that the time to send a signal from Chicago to New York and back by microwave signal is about 4.5 milliseconds less than to send it by optical fiber but, when Spread Networks was laying its line, the conventional wisdom was that microwave transmission's data capacity was too limited and unreliable due to sensitivity to inclement weather. \"But what if microwave technology improved?,\" the author wondered. The story ends as the author climbs up a mountain summit where one of the towers is stationed. He notes the tower showed signs of age, and could have been erected some time ago, for some other purpose, but the ancillary equipment including a generator, a concrete bunker, and repeaters that amplify financial signals, were all new.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nThe book has drawn criticism from some academics and industry experts, particularly on Lewis's views on HFT and other claimed factual inaccuracies in its description of trading strategies. Other critics have praised Lewis's explanations of trading concepts and concurred in his criticisms of HFT. However, it is suggested that he neglected to pay attention to the larger issue of financial regulation, and excessively simplified the relationships between institutions in the financial market. Some industry executives have dismissed the book as \"closer to fiction\". Michael Lewis responded that those who said he \"got it wrong\" have a financial stake in the existing system.\nManoj Narang, CEO of high-frequency trading firm Tradeworx, argued that Lewis' book is more \"fiction than fact,\" claiming Lewis needs a primer in HFT. A review by academic blogger Scott Locklin notes that Lewis had never spoken to, nor cited, a single high-frequency trader in the book. Andrew Ross, writing in The Guardian, praised the book as an \"effective exposé\" but criticizes the author for arguing for the \"heroism\" of one group of financial insiders over another. A month later, an article in The Economist noted that Lewis's book had generated \"vigorous criticism\", but that there may be some merits in its liquidity concerns.\nA Financial Post reviewer suggested that Lewis intentionally omitted details that point to market-stabilizing benefits of HFT: \"Ironically, the Flash Crash itself was just glossed over. Could that be because the primary cause of that momentary blip lay in a confluence of regulatory mistakes and that it was many of the demonized HFTs who actually stood fast throughout and thereby ensured that the damage was a fraction of what it could have been had only the shell-shocked, traditional participants been left to respond?\"\nAn Oxford University Press handbook chapter authored by Andreas Fleckner calls Flash Boys a readable and mostly accurate introduction into such topics as dark pools, front-running, or kickbacks. However, the article suggests that on-site trading practices are too technical for laymen, market observers, or even regulators to fully understand. The author recommends providing incentives for self-regulation rather than SEC regulation.\nFelix Salmon, a financial columnist for Slate, asserted that the negative impact of high-frequency trading was restricted to \"very rich\" financial intermediaries, such as hedge funds. He noted that Lewis's story \"needs victims\" and that he portrayed several billionaire characters as victims \"by pulling out every rhetorical device he can muster.\" In a crucial part of the book's narrative, a mutual fund manager named Rich Gates was \"shocked\" to find out he was paying 0.04% per trade due to his fund's dependence on an HFT front. The reviewer noted that Gates' own mutual fund charged an average of 2.41% for \"expenses\" to retail investors.\n\n\n== Impact and aftermath ==\nIn April 2014 the book reached No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list, remaining on the top for three weeks, before being overtaken by Capital in the Twenty-First Century on May 18, 2014.\nJonathan Weil at Bloomberg suggests that the FBI's investigation into high frequency trading, a day after the book's release, was directly motivated by the book's claims.\nLewis's phrase \"The market is rigged\" was often referenced. The chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mary Jo White, stated in Congressional testimony on April 29, 2014, that U.S. financial markets \"are not rigged\" in response to a direct question on claims in Lewis's book.\nFormer New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg disputed claims made in Lewis' book on May 2, 2014, stating in a CNBC interview that \"the system isn’t rigged.\" Arthur Levitt, adviser to high-frequency firm KCG Holdings and former SEC chairman, commented that variation exists within the group of high-speed traders that Lewis’ book describes, saying \"What is missed in the book and in the general discussion of HFT is there are some HFT traders who respect the sanctity of the investor, and some who don’t.\"\nFinance journalist Matt Levine criticised an emerging pattern of commentators using the regulatory term front-running incorrectly to refer to price discovery.\n\n\n== Film ==\nIn April 2014, Sony Pictures acquired the film rights to the book. In June that year, it was announced that Flash Boys was to be adapted into a major motion picture, with acclaimed screenwriter/producer Aaron Sorkin penning the screenplay, and Scott Rudin and Eli Bush producing the film. The project would be a second collaboration between Sorkin and Rudin on a Lewis book adaptation, as the pair also filled the same respective roles on Moneyball.\nBy September 2017, the project had not appeared to make any progress, seemingly stuck in development hell. Lewis commented his thoughts as to the stumbling block to a book-to-movie adaptation during a session at the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C. During a conversation with Washington Post journalist Joel Aschenbach, Lewis stated the trouble was Hollywood won't cast \"a movie with an Asian lead.\" (The real-life main character in Flash Boys, IEX founder Brad Katsuyama, is of Asian heritage.) Lewis stated that private emails leaked in the 2014 Sony Pictures hack revealed studio apprehension with having an Asian lead actor, as well as with an Asian character portrayed by a White actor.\nIn May 2018 it was announced that Sony Pictures' option for the screenplay had expired and film rights were acquired by Netflix. Ben Jacoby was named as the new screenwriter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHeadlands Technologies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nFlash Boys official site at W. W.

The book captures an important period in the history of Wall Street. Two important figures in that history feature prominently in the text, the head of Salomon Brothers' mortgage department Lewis Ranieri and the firm's CEO John Gutfreund.\nThe book's name is taken from liar's poker, a gambling game popular with the bond traders in the book.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe narrative of Liar's Poker jumps back and forth between two different threads.\nOne thread is autobiographical: it follows Lewis through his college education, his hiring by Salomon Brothers (now a subsidiary of Citigroup) in 1984, and his training at the firm. It is a first-person account of the personalities, workplace practices, and culture of bond traders. Several high-ranking Salomon Brothers employees of the era, such as arbitrageur John Meriwether, mortgage department head Lewis Ranieri, and firm CEO John Gutfreund, feature prominently.\nThe book's other thread gives an overview of Wall Street history before focusing on the history of Salomon Brothers in particular. This thread is less dependent on Lewis' personal experience and features quotes drawn from interviews. It is primarily concerned with how the Salomon Brothers firm almost single-handedly created a market for mortgage bonds that made the firm wealthy, only to be outdone by Michael Milken and his junk bonds.\n\n\n== Biographical section ==\nLewis was an art history student at Princeton University who wanted to break into Wall Street to make money. He describes his almost pathetic attempts to find a finance job, only to be roundly rejected by every firm to which he applied. For example, in 1982 Lehman Brothers had rejected his employment application. He then enrolled in the London School of Economics to gain a master's degree in economics.\nWhile in England, Lewis was invited to a banquet hosted by the Queen Mother, where his cousin, Baroness Linda Monroe von Stauffenberg, one of the organizers of the banquet, purposefully seated him next to the wife of the London managing partner of Salomon Brothers. Lewis's cousin hoped that his intelligence might impress the partner's wife enough to suggest to her husband that Lewis be given a job with Salomon Brothers. The strategy worked, and Lewis was granted an interview and subsequently received a job offer.\nLewis then moved to New York City for Salomon's training program. Here he was appalled at the sophomoric, obtuse and obnoxious behavior of some of his fellow trainees as they were indoctrinated into the money culture of Salomon Brothers and the Wall Street culture as a whole.\nFrom New York, Lewis was shipped off to the London office of Salomon Brothers as a bond salesman. Despite his lack of knowledge, he was soon handling millions of dollars in investment accounts. In 1987 he witnessed a near-hostile takeover of Salomon Brothers but survived with his job. However, growing disillusioned with his work, Lewis quit the firm at the beginning of 1988 to write this book and become a financial journalist.  The book was published October 17, 1989.\n\n\n== Wall Street culture ==\nThe book is an unflattering portrayal of Wall Street traders and salesmen, their personalities, their beliefs and their work practices.\nDuring the training sessions, Lewis was struck by the infantilism of most of his fellow trainees. Examples included: yelling at and insulting financial experts who talked to them; throwing spit balls at one another and at lecturers; calling phone sex lines and then broadcasting them over the company's intercom; gambling on behavioral traits (such as how long it took certain trainees to fall asleep during lectures); and the trainees' incredible lust for money and contempt for any position that did not earn much.\nLewis attributed the bond traders' and salesmen's behavior to the fact that the trading floor required neither finesse nor advanced financial knowledge, but rather, the ability and desire to exploit others' weaknesses, to intimidate others into listening to traders and salesmen, and the ability to spend hours a day screaming orders under high-pressure situations. He referred to their worldview as \"The Law of the Jungle\".\nHe also noted that, although most arrivals on Wall Street had studied economics, this knowledge was never used.  In fact, any academic knowledge was frowned on by traders.\nLewis also attributed the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s and 1990s to the inability of inexperienced and provincial small-town bank managers to compete with Wall Street. He described people on Wall Street as masters at taking advantage of an undiscerning public, which the savings and loan industry provided in abundance.\n\n\n== Catch phrases ==\nBig Swinging Dick — A big-time trader or salesman. (\"If he could make millions of dollars come out of those phones, he became that most revered of all species: a Big Swinging Dick\".  p. 56.) The opposite of this term is Geek, used to refer to a just-hired trainee.\nEquities in Dallas — A particularly undesirable job within a finance firm. (\"Thus, Equities in Dallas became training program shorthand for 'Just bury that lowest form of human scum where it will never be seen again'.\" p. 58.)\nBlowing up a customer — Convincing a customer to purchase an investment product which ends up declining rapidly in value, forcing the client to end up withdrawing from the market.\nFeeding Frenzy — The Friday-morning meal shared by a certain clique of bond traders. At this meal, traders would order astounding quantities of take-out food, far more than they could eat (e.g., five-gallon tubs of guacamole with an order of $400 worth of Mexican food). The traders would then compete with each other to see who could display the most gluttony.\nThe Human Piranha — Nickname for an employee  at Salomon Brothers who constantly used the word \"fuck\" and its variants in his speech. A reference to Tom Wolfe's character in The Bonfire of the Vanities.\nNo Tears — Used to describe a preset alternate rule Michael Lewis describes in the book, John Gutfreund challenges John Meriwether to a game of liar's poker, in which he states \"no tears\" which means players of the game who lose can't complain about losing afterwards.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDespite the book's quite unflattering depiction of Wall Street firms and many of the people who worked there, many younger readers were fascinated by the life depicted. Many read it as a \"how-to manual\" and asked the author for additional secrets that he might care to share.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLiar's Poker (book details) - The Official Michael Lewis Website\nPushkin Industries - 2022 Unabridged Audiobook release",

    "full_narrative": "Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game is a book by Michael Lewis, published in 2003, about the Oakland Athletics baseball team and its general manager Billy Beane. It describes the team's sabermetric approach to assembling a competitive baseball team on a small budget. It was adapted into the 2011 film Moneyball, starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe central premise of Moneyball is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the front office) over the past century is outdated, subjective, and often flawed, and that the statistics traditionally used to gauge players, such as stolen bases, runs batted in, and batting average, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game. Sabermetrics and statistical analysis had demonstrated, for example, that on-base percentage and slugging percentage are better measures of batting. The Oakland A's began seeking players who were \"undervalued in the market\"—that is, who were receiving lower salaries relative to their ability to contribute to winning, as measured by these advanced statistics.\nBy re-evaluating their strategy in this way, the 2002 Athletics, with a budget of $44 million for player salaries, were competitive with larger-market teams such as the New York Yankees, whose payroll exceeded $125 million that season. The approach brought the A's to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.\nLewis explored several themes in the book, such as insiders vs. outsiders (established traditionalists vs. upstart proponents of sabermetrics), the democratization of information causing a flattening of hierarchies, and \"the ruthless drive for efficiency that capitalism demands\".\nMoneyball also looks at how the A's evaluated prospects. Sabermetricians argue that a college baseball player's chance of MLB success is much higher than the more traditional high school draft pick. Beane maintains that high draft picks spent on high school prospects, regardless of talent or physical potential as evaluated by traditional scouting, are riskier than those spent on more experienced college players. College players have played more games and thus there is a larger mass of statistical data on which to base expensive decisions. Lewis cites A's minor leaguer Jeremy Bonderman, drafted out of high school in 2001 over Beane's objections, as an example of the type of draft pick Beane would avoid. Bonderman had all of the traditional \"tools\" that scouts look for, but thousands of such players have been signed by MLB organizations out of high school over the years and failed to develop as anticipated. Lewis explores the A's approach to the 2002 MLB draft, when the team had a run of early picks. The book documents Beane's often tense discussions with his scouting staff (who favored traditional subjective evaluation of potential rather than objective sabermetrics) in preparation for the draft to the actual draft, which defied all expectations and was considered at the time a wildly successful (if unorthodox) effort by Beane.\nMoneyball traces the history of the sabermetric movement back to such people as Bill James (then a member of the Boston Red Sox front office) and Craig R. Wright. Lewis explores how James's seminal Baseball Abstract, published annually from the late 1970s through the late 1980s, influenced many of the young, up-and-coming baseball experts that joined the ranks of baseball management in the 1990s.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\"Moneyball\" has entered baseball's lexicon; teams that value sabermetrics are often said to be playing Moneyball. Baseball traditionalists, in particular some scouts and media members, decry the sabermetric revolution and have disparaged Moneyball for emphasizing sabermetrics over more traditional methods of player evaluation. Nevertheless, Moneyball changed the way many major league front offices do business. In its wake, teams such as the New York Mets, New York Yankees, San Diego Padres, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Red Sox, Washington Nationals, Arizona Diamondbacks, Cleveland Guardians, and Toronto Blue Jays have hired full-time sabermetric analysts.\nWhen the Mets hired Sandy Alderson—Beane's predecessor and mentor with the A's—as their general manager after the 2010 season, and hired Beane's former associates Paul DePodesta and J. P. Ricciardi to the front office, the team was jokingly referred to as the \"Moneyball Mets\". Like the Oakland A's in the 1990s, the Mets had been directed by their ownership to slash payroll. Under Alderson's tenure, the team payroll dropped below $100 million per year from 2012 to 2014, and the Mets reached the 2015 World Series—en route defeating MLB's highest-payroll team, the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nIn the 2019 and 2020 seasons, the Tampa Bay Rays were considered masters of Moneyball, reaching the 2020 World Series with a payroll prorated at $28.2 million, the third-lowest of Major League Baseball's 30 teams.\nLewis has acknowledged that the book's success may have hurt the Athletics' fortunes as other teams accepted sabermetrics, reducing Oakland's edge.\nSince the book's publication and success, Lewis has discussed plans for a sequel to Moneyball called Underdogs, revisiting the players and their relative success several years into their careers, although only four players from the 2002 draft played much at the Major League level.\nMoneyball has also influenced and been influenced by other professional sports teams including European club association football (soccer). Beane has regarded Arsenal F.C.'s former manager Arsène Wenger as a personal idol. Beane has held discussions with Wenger, former Manchester United F.C. manager Alex Ferguson, and Liverpool F.C. owner John W. Henry. His friendship with ex-Arsenal scout Damien Comolli and Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke allowed him to delve deep into the world of English football. According to El País, Liverpool F.C. co-owner John W. Henry did not trust public opinion, so he looked for a mathematical method similar to the one used for the Boston Red Sox, which he also owns via Fenway Sports Group, in guiding them to three World Series wins. The mathematical model turned out to be that of Cambridge physicist Ian Graham, which was used to select the manager (Jürgen Klopp) and players essential for Liverpool to win the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRichard Thaler of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School described the book as a \"sensation... Lewis has a wonderful story to tell, and he tells it wonderfully... Lewis also raises some serious puzzles that he does not resolve, and his account has some large and perhaps profound implications that he does not much explore.\"\nDavid Haglund of Slate and Jonah Keri of Grantland criticized the book for glossing over key young talent acquired through the draft and signed internationally. They argued that the book ignores the pitching trio of Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder, and Barry Zito, and position players such as Eric Chavez and Miguel Tejada, all of whom were discovered via traditional scouting methodology and were key contributors to the success of the 2002 Athletics. In 2002, Zito received the AL Cy Young Award and Tejada the AL MVP Award.\nSheldon and Alan Hirsch also argue against Moneyball's thesis in their 2011 book The Beauty of Short Hops: How Chance and Circumstance Confound the Moneyball Approach to Baseball, pointing out that the 2002 A's were notable for allowing fewer runs than other teams, not scoring more.\n\n\n== Film ==\n\nA movie based on the book was released in 2011. Actor Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, while Jonah Hill plays fictional character Peter Brand, based on Paul DePodesta; Philip Seymour Hoffman plays A's manager Art Howe. Academy Award-winning screenwriter Steve Zaillian was hired to write the script, and Steven Soderbergh was slated to direct, replacing David Frankel. But in June 2009, because of conflicts over a revised script by Soderbergh, Sony put the movie on hold just days before it was scheduled to begin shooting. Soderbergh was eventually let go.\nBennett Miller took over directing duties, and Aaron Sorkin rewrote the script.  Shooting began in July 2010 at Blair Field, the sports stadium for Wilson High School (Long Beach), Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, Dodger Stadium, and the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum. Moneyball was released in theaters on September 23, 2011. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actor and Best Picture.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe book is parodied in the 2010 Simpsons episode \"MoneyBART\", in which Lisa manages Bart's Little League baseball team using sabermetric principles. Bill James made an appearance in this episode.\nThe film adaptation is mentioned in Brooklyn Nine-Nine as being Captain Raymond Holt's favorite film because of the beauty of its statistical analysis. Additionally, Moneyball was the namesake for the Moneyball Act by U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee and Mark DeSaulnier with the intended purpose of having MLB teams that move 25 miles from their former home cities, including the Athletics, to compensate them.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEvidence-based practices\nCasey Award\nBall Four\nBull Durham\nNate Silver who developed PECOTA, the Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm, to predict baseball player performance\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMoneyball (book details) – The Official Michael Lewis website\nMajoring In Moneyball by John Manuel\nBilly Beane's Perfect Draft: A Baseball Revolution? by Richard van Zandt – guest column at BaseballEvolution.com (April 13, 2006)\nRoberts, Russ (January 29, 2007). \"Michael Lewis on the Hidden Economics of Baseball and Football\".

    "full_narrative": "Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones is a 2018 self-help book by James Clear, a researcher of habit formation. The book received acclaim from most critics, with a few strongly disapproving of its claims. It became highly popular among readers in the years following its publication; as of February 2024, it has sold nearly 25 million copies, and had topped the New York Times best-seller list for 260 weeks (nearly 5 years)[1]\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn Atomic Habits, James Clear, a researcher of how humans form habits, gives readers advice on breaking any habit which negatively affects them—such as procrastinating or succumbing to an addiction—as well as replacing it with a positive habit, such as working efficiently or abstaining from an addiction. He claims that if the reader often displays negative habitual behavior, it is not caused by \"you\"—in that \"you\" specifically are inherently predisposed to perpetuating the habit, as the reader may believe—but rather by \"your system\": the reader's network of previously self-imposed mental barriers which now prevent the personal growth they need to break the habit. Clear writes that this \"system\" can also prevent the reader from naturally displaying positive habitual behavior, but says that they can break their system down over time.\nClear says that all habits are made of a \"cue, craving, response, and reward”, which he exemplifies with people needing light to see: a person receives a \"cue\" that they need light to see inside of a room, they \"crave\" better vision and thus turn on a light in the room, they feel the \"response\" of better vision, and get the \"reward\" of seeing clearly.\nThe book's \"ethos\" is that a reader's \"lack of willpower\" towards displaying positive habits is best fought with \"getting 1% better each day\": if they make a routine of displaying \"atomic habits\", positive habits which require little exertion, they builds up their ability to display larger ones which, otherwise, they would not have enough willpower to do routinely. Clear says that \"designing the right environment to build habits\" is necessary for this; the reader should focus on the \"deepest layer of behavior change\"—changing their identity—which he simplifies by saying, \"the goal isn’t to run a marathon, it’s to become a runner.” For this task, the reader should engage in self-actualization, finding out \"who [they] want to be\" and proving their new identity to themselves by solving the tasks required to become that person.\nSimilar to other self-help books, but with his own terminology, Clear recommends \"stacking\", or starting a task immediately after finishing another; and then \"temptation bundling\", giving yourself a small reward for doing the \"stacked\" habits. He notes that positive habits come more naturally to some people than others; as an example, he says that people with higher oxytocin levels are more likely to be \"high in agreeableness\", so they \"might be inclined to build habits like writing thank-you notes.\"\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nAtomic Habits was first published by Avery Publishing (an imprint of the Penguin Group) on October 16, 2018. The book was reissued in 2023 with a new cover design by George Griffiths, which won the Penguin Cover Design Award in 2024 for books in the adult non-fiction category.\nAfter the book's publication, Clear started selling the \"Clear Habit Journal\", a daily planner intended to aid in the development of good habits. In 2024, he released a smartphone app named \"Atoms\", designed to help in the same way.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAtomic Habits was not an instant success, only gaining popularity in the years following its publication. In 2024, Omaid Homayum wrote for Forbes that the book had \"caught fire\", having sold nearly 20 million copies—faster-selling than famous self-help book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Homayum said that quotes from Clear's book had \"broken the internet [sic]\". As of February 14, 2024, the book had topped the New York Times best-seller list of U.S. book sales for 164 weeks, and was the top-selling book on Amazon. Slate wrote that Atomic Habits was the \"self-help book of the decade\". In 2025, the book came #10 in The Sunday Times Bestsellers List of U.K. book sales.\nIn Entrepreneur magazine, John Rampton listed Atomic Habits as one of the 17 best books ever written on management and productivity. Dayana Aleksandrova wrote for Business Insider that the book was \"unanimously recommended\" by every person she questioned about how they achieved a \"higher-performer\" work ethic, and that reading the book \"change[d] my life for the better\": \"So far, the lessons I've taken away from the book have worked at an 100% success rate — especially when it comes to addressing procrastination.\" Nikk Cottrell wrote for The Independent that the book had positively \"changed the course of my year\". For Literary Hub, James Folta that the book became a part of the literary canon among \"business thought leader[s]\" on LinkedIn. Actress Rosamund Pike said that since reading the book, she had become interested in achieving \"marginal gains\". Luigi Mangione, the accused murderer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, listed the book as one of his favorites on Goodreads.\nSome critics were skeptical or disapproving of Atomic Habits' theories. Anthony Lane wrote for The New Yorker that inevitably, \"[a reader's] conscience rebels\" against the advice of self-help books like Atomic Habits if a minor obstacle comes in the way of their own reading habit: \"You were reading James Clear's [book and] doing well until you spilled half a bottle of Knob Creek over the last sixty pages. Now you’ll never know how it ends.\" Steven Phillips-Horst strongly rebuked the book's theories and alleged usefulness in The Guardian, saying it is one of many trending \"modern therapy [books] with pseudoscientific grand theories on human behavior\"—like The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck and The Body Keeps the Score—that contain \"comforting yet impenetrable\" advice. He said the books \"peddle feel-good Marvel movie versions of philosophy that don’t challenge our conceptions, but validate our feelings, often backing up their circular logic with dubious 'research' and 'experts'.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

    "full_narrative": "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life is a 2016 nonfiction self-help book by American blogger and author Mark Manson. The book covers Manson's belief that life's struggles give it meaning and argues that typical self-help books offer meaningless positivity which is neither practical nor helpful. It was a New York Times and Globe and Mail bestseller.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck was published under the imprint of HarperOne, a division of HarperCollins Publishers. It was released on September 13, 2016.\nAs of July 2024, over 20 million copies of the book had been sold.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe book is a reaction to the self-help industry and what Manson saw as a culture of mindless positivity that is not practical or helpful for most people. Manson uses many of his own personal experiences to illustrate how life's struggles often give it more meaning, which, he argues, is a better approach than constantly trying to be happy. Manson's approach and writing style have been described as different from other self-help books, using blunt honesty and profanity to illustrate his ideas.\nThe book has nine chapters. The first chapter, Don't Try, is named after the philosophy of Charles Bukowski, who served as a major inspiration for the whole book.\nThe chapters have the following titles:\n\nDon't Try.\nHappiness is a problem.\nYou are not special.\nThe value of suffering.\nYou are always choosing.\nYou are wrong about everything (But so am I).\nFailure is the way forward.\nThe importance of saying no.\nAnd then you die.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck argues that individuals should seek to find meaning through what they find to be important and only engage in values that they can control. Values (such as popularity) that are not under a person's control are, according to the book, 'bad values'. Furthermore, individuals should strive to replace these uncontrollable values with things they have the capability to change, such as punctuality, honesty, or kindness. Manson further cautions against claiming certainty about knowledge that is out of one's grasp, especially in the case of attempting to leave a legacy. Meaning can be found, Manson claims, when one seeks to create joy in the moment for one's self and those around one, as opposed to being concerned with building a body of work as a legacy.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck  was released as a documentary film in 2023 with Mark Manson himself narrating the film. The film was directed by Nathan Price and produced by Tom Blackwell and Matthew Metcalfe. It was produced by GFC Films, Ingenious Media, and Trellick Films. Universal Pictures served as the distributor for the film.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck first appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List at #6 for the category of How-to and Miscellaneous for the week of October 2, 2016. It reached #1 for the first time on July 16, 2017. As of the mid of September 2024, the book has spent 327 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list.\nThe book also appeared on the Washington Post Bestseller List at #9 in the Non-fiction/General category for the week of September 25, 2016, and on the Toronto Star List at #1 in the Self-Improvement category on September 23, 2016. In 2017, it was the best-selling nonfiction book from Barnes & Noble, the #4 best-selling book on all of Amazon.com, and the #9 best-selling book in Canada.\nKirkus Reviews said that the book was \"[a] good yardstick by which self-improvement books should be measured.\"\nErica Rivera, writing for Mandatory, describes Manson's style in the book as being \"as blunt as a man-to-man chat\", and Katherine Pushkar describes it as \"foul-mouthed, funny-as-hell, [and] dead-on\", and his philosophy thus: \"that life is hard, you're not special, happiness is a hollow goal and therefore you should make sure you're focused on the truly worthwhile\", in her review in the New York Daily News.\nThe book was noted as a prominent instance of an industry wide trend of swear words in book titles during the 2010s.\nCritics have been quick to note that the apparent lack of sophistication in language and style of the book is a clever disguise for more serious value-related content of the book.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMark Manson – Official Website",

It deals with what Ferriss refers to as \"lifestyle design\", and repudiates the traditional \"deferred\" life plan in which people work grueling hours and take few vacations for decades and save money in order to relax after retirement. The book spent four years on The New York Times Best Seller List, was translated into 40 languages, and sold around 2.1 million copies.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFerriss developed the ideas present in The 4-Hour Workweek (4HWW) while working 14-hour days at his sports nutrition supplement company, BrainQUICKEN. Frustrated by the overwork and lack of free time, Ferriss took a 3-week sabbatical to Europe. During that time and continued travels throughout Europe, Asia, and South America, Ferriss developed a streamlined system of checking email once per day and outsourcing small daily tasks to virtual assistants like AskSunday, paying them meagerly. His personal escape from a workaholic lifestyle was the genesis of the book.\nThe format of The 4-Hour Workweek took shape during a series of lectures Ferriss delivered on high-tech entrepreneurship at Princeton University, his alma mater. The lectures (and book) described Ferriss's own experiences in company automation and lifestyle development.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe New York Times noted that Ferriss spends far more than 4 hours per week in blogging and self-promotion, which Ferriss describes as \"evangelizing.\" USA Today  commented: \"If it all sounds too good to be true, maybe it is. Or maybe not. Clearly, selective ignorance, farming out chores and applying the 80/20 principle have paid off for Ferriss.\"  Wired praised the book's ideas for remote work and its pre-retirement advice, but faulted it for \"formulaic writing\" and that \"nearly every idea [is] taken to an extreme. No sense of work being anything more than a paycheck\". Some reviewers noted that the book was quite lengthy and hard to read. Leslie Garner of The Telegraph noted that the book had a \"punchy writing style\" and that Ferriss had \"struck a chord with his critique of workers' slavish devotion to corporations.\" Meagan Day of Jacobin criticized the book for advising readers to \"become a fake expert.\" Jimmy Wales, cofounder of Wikipedia, said that he secretly moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina for a month after reading the book.\nThe book received coverage also through Fast Company, ABC News, The Today Show, Newsweek, and MSNBC.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe book was mentioned in a 2011 episode of The Office (2005-2013) entitled \"Lotto\" (S08E03), in which warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin uses his interpretation of the book's ideas to do less work after not receiving a promotion.\nOn September 21, 2023, the book was featured on an episode of the podcast If Books Could Kill.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

    "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • When we deny our stories, they define us. When we own our stories, we get to write the ending. Don’t miss the five-part Max docuseries Brené Brown: Atlas of the Heart! Social scientist Brené Brown has ignited a global conversation on courage, vulnerability, shame, and worthiness. Her pioneering work uncovered a profound truth: Vulnerability—the willingness to show up and be seen with no guarantee of outcome—is the only path to more love, belonging, creativity, and joy. But living a brave life is not always easy: We are, inevitably, going to stumble and fall. It is the rise from falling that Brown takes as her subject in Rising Strong. As a grounded theory researcher, Brown has listened as a range of people—from leaders in Fortune 500 companies and the military to artists, couples in long-term relationships, teachers, and parents—shared their stories of being brave, falling, and getting back up. She asked herself, What do these people with strong and loving relationships, leaders nurturing creativity, artists pushing innovation, and clergy walking with people through faith and mystery have in common? The answer was clear: They recognize the power of emotion and they’re not afraid to lean in to discomfort. Walking into our stories of hurt can feel dangerous. But the process of regaining our footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is tested and our values are forged. Our stories of struggle can be big ones, like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship, or smaller ones, like a conflict with a friend or colleague. Regardless of magnitude or circumstance, the rising strong process is the same: We reckon with our emotions and get curious about what we’re feeling; we rumble with our stories until we get to a place of truth; and we live this process, every day, until it becomes a practice and creates nothing short of a revolution in our lives. Rising strong after a fall is how we cultivate wholeheartedness. It’s the process, Brown writes, that teaches us the most about who we are. ONE OF GREATER GOOD’S FAVORITE BOOKS OF THE YEAR “[Brené Brown’s] research and work have given us a new vocabulary, a way to talk with each other about the ideas and feelings and fears we’ve all had but haven’t quite known how to articulate. . . .

    "full_narrative": "The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph is the third book by author Ryan Holiday. It was published in 2014. Holiday offers individuals a framework to \"flip obstacles into opportunities\". It was inspired by the philosophy of stoicism.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe title of the book is drawn from a quote from Meditations by Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius: “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” Holiday draws from Meditations, Aurelius, and the philosophy of Stoicism to expand the central theme of the book, which is that how we respond to obstacles is what defines us. Holiday argues that if an individual learns the framework to flip obstacles into success, he or she can be better for it.\nThe framework that Holiday offers is composed of three disciplines: perception, action and will. As he explains this, Holiday supplements each section with historical anecdotes and figures from politics, commerce, sports, and history.\n\n\n== Preface ==\nIn the preface, Holiday begins by setting the scene in the year of 170 in Germania, as Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote down the formula for getting through rough situations. Holiday emphasizes that Aurelius' formula was not a \"formula for thriving not just in spite of whatever happens but because of it.\"\nHoliday notes that the book will study how individuals took their struggles, flipped them around and enhanced a virtue or skillset. He issues a call to action to the reader, to join the band of individuals that have challenged themselves to better themselves through the obstacles they've faced.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nHoliday begins with a story of a king with a kingdom of people who had grown slightly entitled. To change this, the king placed a large boulder in the middle of the main road, blocking entry to the city. He watched as many of the kingdom's people tried to go on the road. Most ended up either looking at it and leaving or put in minimal effort before giving up. After a few days, a peasant came to the town. Like the citizens of the town, he first tried to move the rock out the way. After realizing the boulder was too massive, he then went into the forest, grabbed a branch which he used as a lever, and was able to move the rock. Afterwards, he discovered that underneath was a purse of gold coins and a note from the King which said \"The Obstacle in the Path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition.\"\n\n\n== Part 1: Perception ==\nHoliday argues that an individual's perspective impacts his or her success. Holiday takes the Stoic point of view, stating that an objective mind, which can \"resist temptation or excitement, no matter how seductive, no matter the situation\" can succeed. He mentions the example of Rockefeller, who stayed grounded by understanding the turbulence of the market and only investing when he deemed it was fit. This allowed his business to flourish throughout multiple economic crises.\nHoliday argues the impact of the physical evolutionary mind in the advanced world we live in is a result of our primal mechanisms messing us over. Holiday argues that we can combat the primal responses that cause us to act irrationally by cultivating discipline in perception.\nHoliday emphasizes two major skills to have during these challenging times: grace and poise. Holiday explains that when stress comes, it triggers the human, primal, senseless reactions. Grace and poise allow individuals to keep a cool head and \"deploy other skill'\" which can help solve the problem.\nHoliday includes a quote from the Gift of Fear, where author Gavin de Becker writes, \"When you worry, ask yourself 'What am I choosing to not see right now?' What important things are you missing because you chose worry over introspection, alertness or wisdom?\" The key point Holiday emphasizes here is that unhelpful emotions can be deconstructed, using logic which helps us figure out root causes and helps keep us grounded\nHoliday encourages the reader to stop being judgmental and take on life with an objective lens. Holiday divides perspective into two definitions: context and framing. Context is how individuals see the specific situation or obstacle amidst the world, their lives and a bigger picture. Framing is how individuals personally evaluate and make sense of the situations they are presented with.\nHoliday lists things that are under an individual's control which include: emotions, judgements, creativity, attitude, perspective, desires, decisions and determination. In the next chapter, he provides a list of businesses that began amidst economic depressions. He argues that the individuals who founded the businesses were able to succeed because they weren't focused on the situation or context at which they were starting their business, but rather the products that they were trying to sell and had strong faith in. Holiday later uses the example of Steve Jobs to drive home the idea that our perception of our capabilities shapes what we end up accomplishing.\nHoliday talks about how transformative it is to be able to understand that the worst thing to occur is for us to be faced with an obstacle and lose our composure. He argues that by not remaining mentally composed, we make the problem larger and heavier upon ourselves.\n\n\n== Part II ==\nIn the preface of part II, Holiday discusses how individuals need to take action that is intentional and not just aimless. He discusses the value of action, specifically, \"directed action\" and writes that action is able to \"dismantle the obstacles in front of us.\"\nHoliday discusses how Amelia Earhart was given the opportunity to fly a plane. He focuses on the fact that when Earhart was offered this, it wasn't presented exactly as the opportunity but rather she was told that she was second choice (the first choice had backed out), and that while the men that were on the flight with her would receive compensation, Earhart would not receive anything. Holiday doesn't use this example to encourage individuals to settle, but rather he argues that individuals with firm faith in themselves jump at the opportunity to start more than anything. This was an opportunity for Earhart to fly a plane and thus she took it. Holiday argues that many times we wait for the conditions to be the way we want them and for the situation to go our way before we act.\nHoliday discusses how in Silicon Valley, start-ups don't release a finalized product but rather a \"minimum viable product\". Holiday says the reason behind this method is to see the consumer demand and response and avoid launching a product that is unwanted by consumers. He writes, \"Failure really can be an asset if what you're trying to do is improve, learn or do something new.\"\nHoliday discusses how the process is about making tasks manageable and looking at the big picture. Instead of focusing too heavily on the overall goal we should focus on the task in front of us.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe book has sold over 100,000 copies since its release and been translated into 17 languages. After the book's release, the book slowly made its way through the community of professional sports, and are being read by a number of prominent athletes and head coaches including Joe Maddon of the Chicago Cubs, Marquette basketball coach Shaka Smart, tennis pro James McGee, NFL lineman Garrett Gilkey, Olympic gold medalist Chandra Crawford, and others. On the way to their 2014 Super Bowl victory, Michael Lombardi and Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots distributed copies of The Obstacle Is the Way to their staff and players. In the  2015 season, Seattle Seahawks GM John Schneider and Pete Carroll passed the book around the team's locker room.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTEDxUofChicago 'Stoic Optimism' by Ryan Holiday\nStephen McGinty: Romans to the rescue The Scotsman June 2014",

In his new book, Stillness Is the Key, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead. All great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillness--to be steady while the world spins around you. In this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and focus. Holiday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness: baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of nature guided her through unimaginable adversity. More than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos and competition. Stillness Is the Key offers a simple but inspiring antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media. The stillness that we all seek is the path to meaning, contentment, and excellence in a world that needs more of it than ever.",

Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world. In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives. Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience \"fear of missing out\" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction. Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions. Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day \"digital declutter\" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.

    "full_narrative": "The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals is a nonfiction book written by American author Michael Pollan published in 2006. As omnivores, humans have a variety of food choices. In the book, Pollan investigates the environmental and animal welfare effects of various food choices. He suggests that, prior to modern food preservation and transportation technologies, the dilemmas caused by these options were resolved primarily by cultural influences.\nTechnology has made previously seasonal or regional foods available year-round and in all regions. Culture, which once moderated the relationship between food and society, has now created confusion. To teach more about those choices, Pollan describes various food chains that end in human food: industrial food, organic food, and food we forage ourselves, from the source to a final meal, and in the process writes a critique of the American method of eating.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nMichael Pollan informs us about how corn, the U.S.'s main food source, is \"taking over the world\" due to its pervasiveness in many of the foods we eat, including beverages made with cornstarch and meat and dairy products from animals fed with corn. Pollan hopes that his book will change the diets in the U.S. of both humans and animals. In the first section, he monitors the development of a calf from a pasture in South Dakota, through its stay on a Kansas feedlot, to its end. The author says that corn is the worst thing for feedlot cows to eat because it hurts their livers. The industry accepts the fact that corn-fed cows naturally become sick as a cost of doing business.\nIn the second section, Pollan describes the large-scale farms and food-processing facilities that largely satisfy surging demand for organic food, using Whole Foods as a proxy. The author intends to demonstrate that, despite the group's rhetoric, the virtues advertised are often questionable. For example, an operation raising \"free-range\" chicken has only a tiny yard available, largely unused by the short-lived birds. Pollan also accuses large-scale organic agriculture of \"floating on a sinking sea of petroleum\" by analyzing that a one-pound box of California-produced organic lettuce—that contains 80 food calories—requires 4,600 calories of fossil fuel to process and ship to the East Coast. He adds that the quantity would be only \"about 4 percent higher if the salad were grown conventionally.\"\nOne of Pollan's main points about the organic farming industry is that it gives people the wrong idea that organic products must come from beautiful open fields.\nIn contrast to his discussion of the large-scale organic food industry, Pollan presents in the third section Joel Salatin, a farmer who manages a successful mid-sized, multi-species meat farm in Virginia and insists on selling his goods nearby and relies on his family and a few interns to supplement his labor. Pollan discusses how each part of the farm directly helps the others—the sun feeds the grass, the grass feeds the cows, the larvae in the cow manure feed the chickens, and the chickens feed the grass with nitrogen. Due to the various cyclical processes on the farm, it does not require fossil fuels.\nThe final section finds Pollan attempting to prepare a meal using only ingredients he has hunted, gathered, or grown himself. He recruits assistance from local foodies, who teach him to hunt feral pigs, gather wild mushrooms, and search for abalone. He also makes a salad of greens from his garden, bakes sourdough bread using wild yeast, and prepares a dessert from cherries picked in his neighborhood.\nPollan concludes that the fast food meal and the hunter-gatherer meal are \"equally unreal and equally unsustainable.\"  He believes that if we were once again aware of the source of our food – what it was, where it came from, how it traveled to reach us, and its true cost –  we would see that we \"eat by the grace of nature, not industry.\"\n\n\n=== On veganism ===\nPollan argues that to \"give up\" human consumption of animals would result in a \"food chain ... even more dependent than it already is on fossil fuels and chemical fertilizers since food would need to travel even farther and fertility –  in the form of manures –  would be in short supply.\" This is because, according to Pollan, in some grassy areas, growing grains or other plant foods is not a viable alternative to raising ruminants for human consumption.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEconomist Tyler Cowen argued, \"The problems with Pollan's 'self-financed' meal reflect the major shortcoming of the book: He focuses on what is before his eyes but neglects the macro perspective of the economist. He wants to make the costs of various foods transparent, but this is an unattainable ideal, given the interconnectedness of markets.\"\nWashington State University, situated in an agricultural area of Washington state, chose this book to be part of its freshman reading program in 2009 but soon canceled the program. Many in the university's community, including those who manage the kinds of industrial farms The Omnivore's Dilemma discusses, were unhappy with the selection, and there was speculation that the cancellation was a result of political influence. Elson Floyd, president of WSU, stated instead that it was a budgetary issue, and when food safety expert William Marler offered to pay the claimed shortfall, the program was reinstated, and Pollan was invited to speak on campus.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nThe New York Times named The Omnivore's Dilemma one of the ten best books of 2006, Additionally, Pollan received a James Beard Award for the work.\nThe book has also been published in a young reader's edition, and it is being used in cross-curricular lessons by teachers interested in promoting its message.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnimal, Vegetable, Miracle (2007)\nEnvironmental effects of meat production\nFood, Inc.

He says that rather than focusing on eating nutrients, people should focus on eating the sort of food that their ancestors would recognize, implying that much of what Americans eat today is not real food, but \"imitations of food\".

Pollan presents case studies mirroring four types of human desires that are reflected in the way that we selectively grow, breed, and genetically engineer plants.

Pollan also discusses the limitations of monoculture, specifically the adoption in Ireland of a single breed of potato (the Irish Lumper) which made the Irish population who depended on it in the 1840s inordinately vulnerable to a fungus to which the breed had no resistance, resulting in the Great Famine. Farmers in Peru, where the potato had ultimately originated, traditionally grew hundreds of distinct varieties, minimizing their exposure to any given pest and thereby the risk of famine.\n\n",

He then spent nearly three years researching the fast-food industry, from the slaughterhouses and packing plants that turn out the burgers to the minimum-wage workers who cook them to the television commercials that entice children to eat them with the lure of cheap toys and colorful playgrounds. The experience enraged and appalled him.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book is divided into two sections: \"The American Way\" and \"Meat and Potatoes\". \"The American Way\" the first part, takes a historical view of the fast food business by analyzing its beginnings within post-World War II America while \"Meat and Potatoes\" examines the specific mechanisms of the fast-food industry within a modern context as well as its influence.\n\n\n=== \"The American Way\" ===\nThe first section of Fast Food Nation opens with a discussion of Carl N. Karcher and the McDonald brothers, examining their roles as pioneers of the fast-food industry in southern California. This discussion is followed by an examination of Ray Kroc and Walt Disney's complicated relationship before ending with the consideration of the intricate, profitable methods of advertising to children. Next, Schlosser visits Colorado Springs, CO and investigates the life and working conditions of the typical fast-food industry employee, learning how fast-food restaurants pay minimum wage to a higher proportion of their employees than any other American industry.\n\n\n=== \"Meat and Potatoes\" ===\nThe second section of the text begins with a discussion of the chemical components that make the food taste so good. Schlosser follows this with a discussion of the life of a typical rancher, considering the difficulties presented to the agricultural world in a new economy. Schlosser analyzes the meatpacking industry, which he tags as the most dangerous job in America. Moreover, the meat produced by slaughterhouses has become increasingly hazardous since the centralization of the industry due to the way cattle are raised, slaughtered, and processed, providing an ideal setting for E coli to spread. Additionally, working conditions continue to grow worse. In the final chapter, Schlosser considers how fast food has matured as an American cultural export following the Cold War and how the collapse of Soviet Communism allowed the mass spread of American goods and services, especially fast food. As a result, the rest of the world is catching up with America's rising obesity rates.\n\n\n=== \"Afterword\" ===\nIn the 2012 edition, Schlosser published a revised edition that included an afterword. In the afterword, he looks back at the relevance and criticism of the first edition and how it inspired other works as well as how the fast food industry has evolved in the ten years following the book, including its effects on policy and childhood obesity rates. He concluded that, given the swift, decisive and effective action that took place as a result of this interest and intervention, many of the problems documented in the book are solvable, given enough political will. The afterword can also be read in an article penned by Schlosser at The Daily Beast.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRob Walker, writing for The New York Times, remarks that \"Schlosser is a serious and diligent reporter\" and that \"Fast Food Nation isn't an airy deconstruction but an avalanche of facts and observations as he examines the fast-food process from meat to marketing.\" Walker however does raise concerns about the data on which Schlosser bases his claims. For example, Schlosser suggests that hundreds have died from E. coli infections as a result of eating fast food. However, as Walker points out, “[Schlosser] extrapolated his figures from an annual total in a report on food-related illness, which itself relied on a good deal of extrapolation. Moreover, that report doesn't address fast food specifically (and in fact Schlosser builds his numbers from figures including E. coli cases that are not even food-borne), which is relevant because fast-food outlets are hardly the only places where processed meat is sold.\"\nJulia Livshin, writing for The Atlantic, believes \"Schlosser's book is not just a compendium of kitchen horror stories. In clean, sober prose packed with facts, he strips away the carefully crafted feel-good veneer of fast food and shows how the industry's astounding success has been achieved, and is sustained, at an equally astounding cost—to the nation's health, environment, economy, and culture.\"\nPublishers Weekly wrote, \"While cataloguing assorted evils with the tenacity and sharp eye of the best investigative journalist, [Schlosser] uncovers a cynical, dismissive attitude to food safety in the fast food industry and widespread circumvention of the government's efforts at regulation enacted after Upton Sinclair's similarly scathing novel exposed the meat-packing industry 100 years ago. By systematically dismantling the industry's various aspects, Schlosser establishes a seminal argument for true wrongs at the core of modern America.\"\nThe book won the 2002 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Nonfiction.\n\n\n=== Industry response ===\nTerrie Dort, president of the National Council of Chain Restaurants, the trade association representing many of the country's major fast-food chains, released this statement about Schlosser and his book: \"It is unfortunate that Mr. Schlosser's book, 'Fast Food Nation,' categorizes the entire fast-food industry in such a negative light. The restaurant companies that comprise the industry provide employment to hundreds of thousands of workers across the country and offer consumers a wide variety in menu options and prices. We take exception to the characterization in this book.\"\nLester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University and a former meat inspector for the USDA, says he has read only \"snippets\" of Schlosser's book but calls it \"well-intentioned criticism.\"\n\n\n== Chew on This ==\n\nAn adaptation of Fast Food Nation for younger readers titled Chew on This: Everything You Don't Want to Know about Fast Food was published in May 2006 by Houghton Mifflin.  Chew on This was first published in 2006, is an adaptation of the main work created by Schlosser and Charles Wilson for younger readers.  This book follows the general plot structure of Fast Food Nation, but simplifies its predecessor's original content to make it more readable for younger children.  \n\n\n=== Reception ===\nSome critical reception has been positive.  Common Sense Media gave the book 4/5 stars, but writing that \"...the photographs seem randomly placed throughout the book, and the narrative can wander a bit.  Even so, teens probably will be inspired to rethink their habits.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Corporation (film) — a 2003 Canadian documentary film critical of the modern-day corporation and its behavior towards society\nLabor rights in American meatpacking industry\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPresentation by Schlosser on Fast Food Nation at the 92nd Street Y, May 31, 2001, C-SPAN\nAudio Interview with The New York Times",

Bourdain believes that the kitchen is no place for dilettantes or slackers and that only those with a masochistic dedication to cooking will remain undeterred.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nStructured as a loose collection of humorous anecdotes, Kitchen Confidential is equal parts confessional narrative and industry commentary on the cooking trade. Bourdain has cited George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London (1933), with its behind-the-scenes examination of the restaurant business in 1920s Paris, as an important influence on the book's themes and tone. He details some of his personal misdeeds and weaknesses, including drug use. He explains how restaurants function economically and warns consumers of the various tricks of restaurateurs. For example, he famously advises customers to avoid ordering fish on a Monday as it is likely left over from the weekend or earlier. He also suggests avoiding well-done beef, since cheaper cuts are often substituted for the top-quality meat used for rarer orders.\n\n\n== TV series ==\nIn 2005, the book was adapted into a television show of the same name, starring Bradley Cooper as a fictionalized Bourdain. The series was cancelled partway into its first season, and only 13 episodes were produced.\n\n\n== Subsequent work ==\nA follow-up work, Medium Raw, was published in 2010.\nIn 2017, amidst the Me Too movement, Bourdain expressed remorse that Kitchen Confidential \"celebrated or prolonged a culture that allowed the kind of grotesque behaviors we're hearing about all too frequently\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnthony Bourdain's blog\nKitchen Confidential on Open Library at the Internet Archive",

In addition, many applied branches of engineering use other, traditional units, such as the British thermal unit (BTU) and the calorie. The standard unit for the rate of heating is the watt (W), defined as one joule per second.\nThe symbol Q for heat was introduced by Rudolf Clausius and Macquorn Rankine in c. 1859.\nHeat released by a system into its surroundings is by convention, as a contributor to internal energy, a negative quantity (Q < 0); when a system absorbs heat from its surroundings, it is positive (Q > 0). Heat transfer rate, or heat flow per unit time, is denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              Q\n              ˙\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\dot {Q}}}\n  \n, but it is not a time derivative of a function of state (which can also be written with the dot notation) since heat is not a function of state. Heat flux is defined as rate of heat transfer per unit cross-sectional area (watts per square metre).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn common language, English 'heat' or 'warmth', just as French chaleur, German Hitze or Wärme, Latin calor, Greek θάλπος, etc. refers to either thermal energy or temperature, or the human perception of these. Later, chaleur (as used by Sadi Carnot), 'heat', and Wärme became equivalents also as specific scientific terms at an early stage of thermodynamics. Speculation on 'heat' as a separate form of matter has a long history, involving the phlogiston theory, the caloric theory, and fire. Many careful and accurate historical experiments practically exclude friction, mechanical and thermodynamic work and matter transfer, investigating transfer of energy only by thermal conduction and radiation. Such experiments give impressive rational support to the caloric theory of heat. To account also for changes of internal energy due to friction, and mechanical and thermodynamic work, the caloric theory was, around the end of the eighteenth century, replaced by the \"mechanical\" theory of heat, which is accepted today.\n\n\n=== 17th century–early 18th century ===\n\n\n==== \"Heat is motion\" ====\n\nAs scientists of the early modern age began to adopt the view that matter consists of particles, a close relationship between heat and the motion of those particles was widely surmised, or even the equivalency of the concepts, boldly expressed by the English philosopher Francis Bacon in 1620. \"It must not be thought that heat generates motion, or motion heat (though in some respects this be true), but that the very essence of heat ... is motion and nothing else.\" \"not a ... motion of the whole, but of the small particles of the body.\" In The Assayer (published 1623) Galileo Galilei, in turn, described heat as an artifact of our minds.\n\n... about the proposition “motion is the cause of heat”... I suspect that people in general have a concept of this which is very remote from the truth. For they believe that heat is a real phenomenon, or property ... which actually resides in the material by which we feel ourselves warmed.\nGalileo wrote that heat and pressure are apparent properties only, caused by the movement of particles, which is a real phenomenon. In 1665, and again in 1681, English polymath Robert Hooke reiterated that heat is nothing but the motion of the constituent particles of objects, and in 1675, his colleague, Anglo-Irish scientist Robert Boyle repeated that this motion is what heat consists of.\n\nHeat has been discussed in ordinary language by philosophers. An example is this 1720 quote from the English philosopher John Locke:\n\nHeat, is a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts of the object, which produces in us that sensation from whence we denominate the object hot; so what in our sensation is heat, in the object is nothing but motion. This appears by the way, whereby heat is produc’d: for we see that the rubbing of a brass nail upon a board, will make it very hot; and the axle-trees of carts and coaches are often hot, and sometimes to a degree, that it sets them on fire, by the rubbing of the nave of the wheel upon it.\nWhen Bacon, Galileo, Hooke, Boyle and Locke wrote \"heat\", they might more have referred to what we would now call \"temperature\". No clear distinction was made between heat and temperature until the mid-18th century, nor between the internal energy of a body and the transfer of energy as heat until the mid-19th century.\nLocke's description of heat was repeatedly quoted by English physicist James Prescott Joule. Also the transfer of heat was explained by the motion of particles. Scottish physicist and chemist Joseph Black wrote: \"Many have supposed that heat is a tremulous ... motion of the particles of matter, which ... motion they imagined to be communicated from one body to another.\" John Tyndall's Heat Considered as Mode of Motion (1863) was instrumental in popularizing the idea of heat as motion to the English-speaking public. The theory was developed in academic publications in French, English and German.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\n\n==== Heat vs. temperature ====\n\nUnstated distinctions between heat and “hotness” may be very old, heat seen as something dependent on the quantity of a hot substance, “heat”, vaguely perhaps distinct from the quality of \"hotness\". In 1723, the English mathematician Brook Taylor measured the temperature—the expansion of the liquid in a thermometer—of mixtures of various amounts of hot water in cold water. As expected, the increase in temperature was in proportion to the proportion of hot water in the mixture. The distinction between heat and temperature is implicitly expressed in the last sentence of his report.\n\nI successively fill'd the Vessels with one, two, three, &c. Parts of hot boiling Water, and the rest cold ... And having first observed where the Thermometer stood in cold Water, I found that its rising from that Mark ... was accurately proportional to the Quantity of hot Water in the Mixture, that is, to the Degree of Heat.\n\n\n==== Evaporative cooling ====\n\nIn 1748, an account was published in The Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays of an experiment by the Scottish physician and chemist William Cullen. Cullen had used an air pump to lower the pressure in a container with diethyl ether. The ether boiled, while no heat was withdrawn from it, and its temperature decreased. And in 1758 on a warm day in Cambridge, England, Benjamin Franklin and fellow scientist John Hadley experimented by continually wetting the ball of a mercury thermometer with ether and using bellows to evaporate the ether. With each subsequent evaporation, the thermometer read a lower temperature, eventually reaching 7 °F (−14 °C).\n\n\n==== Discovery of specific heat ====\n\nIn 1756 or soon thereafter, Joseph Black, Cullen’s friend and former assistant, began an extensive study of heat. In 1760 Black realized that when two different substances of equal mass but different temperatures are mixed, the changes in number of degrees in the two substances differ, though the heat gained by the cooler substance and lost by the hotter is the same. Black related an experiment conducted by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit on behalf of Dutch physician Herman Boerhaave. For clarity, he then described a hypothetical but realistic variant of the experiment: If equal masses of 100 °F water and 150 °F mercury are mixed, the water temperature increases by 20 ° and the mercury temperature decreases by 30 ° (both arriving at 120 °F), even though the heat gained by the water and lost by the mercury is the same. This clarified the distinction between heat and temperature. It also introduced the concept of specific heat capacity, being different for different substances. Black wrote: \"Quicksilver [mercury] ... has less capacity for the matter of heat than water.\"\n\n\n==== Degrees of heat ====\nIn his investigations of specific heat, Black used a unit of heat he called \"degrees of heat\"—as opposed to just \"degrees\" [of temperature]. This unit was context-dependent and could only be used when circumstances were identical. It was based on change in temperature multiplied by the mass of the substance involved.\n\nIf the stone and water ... were equal in bulk ... the water was heated by 10 degrees, the stone ... cooled 20 degrees; but if ... the stone had only the fiftieth part of the bulk of the water, it must have been ... 1000 degrees hotter before it was plunged into the water than it is now, for otherwise it could not have communicated 10 degrees of heat to ... [the] water.\n\n\n==== Discovery of latent heat ====\n\nIt was known that when the air temperature rises above freezing—air then becoming the obvious heat source—snow melts very slowly and the temperature of the melted snow is close to its freezing point. In 1757, Black started to investigate if heat, therefore, was required for the melting of a solid, independent of any rise in temperature. As far Black knew, the general view at that time was that melting was inevitably accompanied by a small increase in temperature, and that no additional heat was needed beyond what this increase in temperature would require in itself. Soon, however, Black was able to show that much more heat was required during melting than could be explained by any increase in temperature alone. He was also able to show that heat is released by a liquid during its freezing; again, much more than could be explained by the decrease of its temperature alone.\nIn 1762, Black announced the following research and results to a society of professors at the University of Glasgow. Black had placed equal masses of ice at 32 °F (0 °C) and water at 33 °F (0.6 °C) respectively in two identical, well separated containers. The water and the ice were both evenly heated to 40 °F by the air in the room, which was at a constant 47 °F (8 °C). The water had therefore received 40 – 33 = 7 “degrees of heat”. The ice had been heated for 21 times longer and had therefore received 7 × 21 = 147 “degrees of heat”. The temperature of the ice had increased by 8 °F. The ice had thus absorbed 8 “degrees of heat”, which Black called sensible heat, manifest as temperature change, which could be felt and measured. In addition to that, 147 – 8 = 139 “degrees of heat” were absorbed as latent heat, manifest as phase change rather than as temperature change.\nBlack next showed that a water temperature of 176 °F was needed to melt an equal mass of ice until it was all 32 °F. So now 176 – 32 = 144 “degrees of heat” seemed to be needed to melt the ice. The modern value for the heat of fusion of ice would be 143 “degrees of heat” on the same scale (79.5 “degrees of heat Celsius”).\nFinally, Black increased the temperature of a mass of water, then vaporized an equal mass of water by even heating. He showed that 830 “degrees of heat” was needed for the vaporization; again based on the time required. The modern value for the heat of vaporization of water would be 967 “degrees of heat” on the same scale.\n\n\n==== First calorimeter ====\n\nA calorimeter is a device used for measuring heat capacity, as well as the heat absorbed or released in chemical reactions or physical changes. In 1780, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier used such an apparatus—which he named 'calorimeter'—to investigate the heat released by respiration, by observing how this heat melted snow surrounding his apparatus. A so called ice calorimeter was used 1782–83 by Lavoisier and his colleague Pierre-Simon Laplace to measure the heat released in various chemical reactions. The heat so released melted a specific amount of ice, and the heat required for the melting of a certain amount of ice was known beforehand.\n\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\nThe modern understanding of heat is often partly attributed to Thompson's 1798 mechanical theory of heat (\"An Inquiry Concerning the Source of the Heat Which Is Excited by Friction\"), postulating a mechanical equivalent of heat.\nA collaboration between Nicolas Clément and Sadi Carnot (Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire) in the 1820s had some related thinking along similar lines. In 1842, Julius Robert Mayer frictionally generated heat in paper pulp and measured the temperature rise. In 1845, Joule published a paper entitled The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat, in which he specified a numerical value for the amount of mechanical work required to \"produce a unit of heat\", based on heat production by friction in the passage of electricity through a resistor and in the rotation of a paddle in a vat of water. The theory of classical thermodynamics matured in the 1850s to 1860s.\n\n\n==== Clausius (1850) ====\nIn 1850, Clausius, responding to Joule's experimental demonstrations of heat production by friction, rejected the caloric doctrine of conservation of heat, writing:\n\nIf we assume that heat, like matter, cannot be lessened in quantity, we must also assume that it cannot be increased; but it is almost impossible to explain the ascension of temperature brought about by friction otherwise than by assuming an actual increase of heat. The careful experiments of Joule, who developed heat in various ways by the application of mechanical force, establish almost to a certainty, not only the possibility of increasing the quantity of heat, but also the fact that the newly-produced heat is proportional to the work expended in its production. It may be remarked further, that many facts have lately transpired which tend to overthrow the hypothesis that heat is itself a body, and to prove that it consists in a motion of the ultimate particles of bodies.\nThe process function Q  was introduced by Rudolf Clausius in 1850.\nClausius described it with the German compound Wärmemenge, translated as \"amount of heat\".\n\n\n==== James Clerk Maxwell (1871) ====\nJames Clerk Maxwell in his 1871  Theory of Heat outlines four stipulations for the definition of heat:\n\nIt is something which may be transferred from one body to another, according to the second law of thermodynamics.\nIt is a measurable quantity, and so can be treated mathematically.\nIt cannot be treated as a material substance, because it may be transformed into something that is not a material substance, e.g., mechanical work.\nHeat is one of the forms of energy.\n\n\n==== Bryan (1907) ====\nIn 1907, G.H. Bryan published an investigation of the foundations of thermodynamics, Thermodynamics: an Introductory Treatise dealing mainly with First Principles and their Direct Applications, B.G. Teubner, Leipzig.\nBryan was writing when thermodynamics had been established empirically, but people were still interested to specify its logical structure. The 1909 work of Carathéodory also belongs to this historical era. Bryan was a physicist while Carathéodory was a mathematician.\nBryan started his treatise with an introductory chapter on the notions of heat and of temperature. He gives an example of where the notion of heating as raising a body's temperature contradicts the notion of heating as imparting a quantity of heat to that body.\nHe defined an adiabatic transformation as one in which the body neither gains nor loses heat. This is not quite the same as defining an adiabatic transformation as one that occurs to a body enclosed by walls impermeable to radiation and conduction.\nHe recognized calorimetry as a way of measuring quantity of heat. He recognized water as having a temperature of maximum density. This makes water unsuitable as a thermometric substance around that temperature. He intended to remind readers of why thermodynamicists preferred an absolute scale of temperature, independent of the properties of a particular thermometric substance.\nHis second chapter started with the recognition of friction as a source of heat, by Benjamin Thompson, by Humphry Davy, by Robert Mayer, and by James Prescott Joule.\nHe stated the First Law of Thermodynamics, or Mayer–Joule Principle as follows:\n\nWhen heat is transformed into work or conversely work is transformed into heat, the quantity of heat gained or lost is proportional to the quantity of work lost or gained.\nHe wrote:\n\nIf heat be measured in dynamical units the mechanical equivalent becomes equal to unity, and the equations of thermodynamics assume a simpler and more symmetrical form.\nHe explained how the caloric theory of Lavoisier and Laplace made sense in terms of pure calorimetry, though it failed to account for conversion of work into heat by such mechanisms as friction and conduction of electricity.\nHaving rationally defined quantity of heat, he went on to consider the second law, including the Kelvin definition of absolute thermodynamic temperature.\nIn section 41, he wrote:\n\n§41. Physical unreality of reversible processes. In Nature all phenomena are irreversible in a greater or less degree. The motions of celestial bodies afford the closest approximations to reversible motions, but motions which occur on this earth are largely retarded by friction, viscosity, electric and other resistances, and if the relative velocities of moving bodies were reversed, these resistances would still retard the relative motions and would not accelerate them as they should if the motions were perfectly reversible.\nHe then stated the principle of conservation of energy.\nHe then wrote:\n\nIn connection with irreversible phenomena the following axioms have to be assumed.\nIf a system can undergo an irreversible change it will do so.\nA perfectly reversible change cannot take place of itself; such a change can only be regarded as the limiting form of an irreversible change.\nOn page 46, thinking of closed systems in thermal connection, he wrote:\n\nWe are thus led to postulate a system in which energy can pass from one element to another otherwise than by the performance of mechanical work.\nOn page 47, still thinking of closed systems in thermal connection, he wrote:\n\n§58. Quantity of Heat. Definition. When energy flows from one system or part of a system to another otherwise than by the performance of work, the energy so transferred i[s] called heat.\nOn page 48, he wrote:\n\n§ 59. When two bodies act thermically on one another the quantities of heat gained by one and lost by the other are not necessarily equal.\nIn the case of bodies at a distance, heat may be taken from or given to the intervening medium.\nThe quantity of heat received by any portion of the ether may be defined in the same way as that received by a material body. [He was thinking of thermal radiation.]\n\nAnother important exception occurs when sliding takes place between two rough bodies in contact. The algebraic sum of the works done is different from zero, because, although the action and reaction are equal and opposite the velocities of the parts of the bodies in contact are different. Moreover, the work lost in the process does not increase the mutual potential energy of the system and there is no intervening medium between the bodies. Unless the lost energy can be accounted for in other ways, (as when friction produces electrification), it follows from the Principle of Conservation of Energy that the algebraic sum of the quantities of heat gained by the two systems is equal to the quantity of work lost by friction. [This thought was echoed by Bridgman, as above.]\n\n\n==== Carathéodory (1909) ====\nA celebrated and frequent definition of heat in thermodynamics is based on the work of Carathéodory (1909), referring to processes in a closed system. Carathéodory was responding to a suggestion by Max Born that he examine the logical structure of thermodynamics.\nThe internal energy UX of a body in an arbitrary state X can be determined by amounts of work adiabatically performed by the body on its surroundings when it starts from a reference state O. Such work is assessed through quantities defined in the surroundings of the body. It is supposed that such work can be assessed accurately, without error due to friction in the surroundings; friction in the body is not excluded by this definition. The adiabatic performance of work is defined in terms of adiabatic walls, which allow transfer of energy as work, but no other transfer, of energy or matter. In particular they do not allow the passage of energy as heat. According to this definition, work performed adiabatically is in general accompanied by friction within the thermodynamic system or body. On the other hand, according to Carathéodory (1909), there also exist non-adiabatic, diathermal walls, which are postulated to be permeable only to heat.\nFor the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat, it is customarily envisaged that an arbitrary state of interest Y is reached from state O by a process with two components, one adiabatic and the other not adiabatic. For convenience one may say that the adiabatic component was the sum of work done by the body through volume change through movement of the walls while the non-adiabatic wall was temporarily rendered adiabatic, and of isochoric adiabatic work. Then the non-adiabatic component is a process of energy transfer through the wall that passes only heat, newly made accessible for the purpose of this transfer, from the surroundings to the body. The change in internal energy to reach the state Y from the state O is the difference of the two amounts of energy transferred.\nAlthough Carathéodory himself did not state such a definition, following his work it is customary in theoretical studies to define heat, Q, to the body from its surroundings, in the combined process of change to state Y from the state O, as the change in internal energy, ΔUY, minus the amount of work, W, done by the body on its surrounds by the adiabatic process, so that Q = ΔUY − W.\nIn this definition, for the sake of conceptual rigour, the quantity of energy transferred as heat is not specified directly in terms of the non-adiabatic process. It is defined through knowledge of precisely two variables, the change of internal energy and the amount of adiabatic work done, for the combined process of change from the reference state O to the arbitrary state Y. It is important that this does not explicitly involve the amount of energy transferred in the non-adiabatic component of the combined process. It is assumed here that the amount of energy required to pass from state O to state Y, the change of internal energy, is known, independently of the combined process, by a determination through a purely adiabatic process, like that for the determination of the internal energy of state X above. The rigour that is prized in this definition is that there is one and only one kind of energy transfer admitted as fundamental: energy transferred as work. Energy transfer as heat is considered as a derived quantity. The uniqueness of work in this scheme is considered to guarantee rigor and purity of conception. The conceptual purity of this definition, based on the concept of energy transferred as work as an ideal notion, relies on the idea that some frictionless and otherwise non-dissipative processes of energy transfer can be realized in physical actuality. The second law of thermodynamics, on the other hand, assures us that such processes are not found in nature.\nBefore the rigorous mathematical definition of heat based on Carathéodory's 1909 paper,\nhistorically, heat, temperature, and thermal equilibrium were presented in thermodynamics textbooks as jointly primitive notions. Carathéodory introduced his 1909 paper thus: \"The proposition that the discipline of thermodynamics can be justified without recourse to any hypothesis that cannot be verified experimentally must be regarded as one of the most noteworthy results of the research in thermodynamics that was accomplished during the last century.\" Referring to the \"point of view adopted by most authors who were active in the last fifty years\", Carathéodory wrote: \"There exists a physical quantity called heat that is not identical with the mechanical quantities (mass, force, pressure, etc.) and whose variations can be determined by calorimetric measurements.\" James Serrin introduces an account of the theory of thermodynamics thus: \"In the following section, we shall use the classical notions of heat, work, and hotness as primitive elements, ... That heat is an appropriate and natural primitive for thermodynamics was already accepted by Carnot. Its continued validity as a primitive element of thermodynamical structure is due to the fact that it synthesizes an essential physical concept, as well as to its successful use in recent work to unify different constitutive theories.\" This traditional kind of presentation of the basis of thermodynamics includes ideas that may be summarized by the statement that heat transfer is purely due to spatial non-uniformity of temperature, and is by conduction and radiation, from hotter to colder bodies. It is sometimes proposed that this traditional kind of presentation necessarily rests on \"circular reasoning\".\nThis alternative approach to the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat differs in logical structure from that of Carathéodory, recounted just above.\nThis alternative approach admits calorimetry as a primary or direct way to measure quantity of energy transferred as heat. It relies on temperature as one of its primitive concepts, and used in calorimetry. It is presupposed that enough processes exist physically to allow measurement of differences in internal energies. Such processes are not restricted to adiabatic transfers of energy as work. They include calorimetry, which is the commonest practical way of finding internal energy differences. The needed temperature can be either empirical or absolute thermodynamic.\nIn contrast, the Carathéodory way recounted just above does not use calorimetry or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat. The Carathéodory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat. As recounted in more detail just above, the Carathéodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity. It is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system, and from the actual work done by the system during the process. That internal energy difference is supposed to have been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work, processes that take the system between the initial and final states. By the Carathéodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes, so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat. This presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the Carathéodory way. In fact, the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition, and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist.\n\n\n==== Planck (1926) ====\nOver the years, for example in his 1879 thesis, but particularly in 1926, Planck advocated regarding the generation of heat by rubbing as the most specific way to define heat. Planck criticised Carathéodory for not attending to this. Carathéodory was a mathematician who liked to think in terms of adiabatic processes, and perhaps found friction too tricky to think about, while Planck was a physicist.\n\n\n== Heat transfer ==\n\n\n=== Heat transfer between two bodies ===\nReferring to conduction, Partington writes: \"If a hot body is brought in conducting contact with a cold body, the temperature of the hot body falls and that of the cold body rises, and it is said that a quantity of heat has passed from the hot body to the cold body.\"\nReferring to radiation, Maxwell writes: \"In Radiation, the hotter body loses heat, and the colder body receives heat by means of a process occurring in some intervening medium which does not itself thereby become hot.\"\nMaxwell writes that convection as such \"is not a purely thermal phenomenon\". In thermodynamics, convection in general is regarded as transport of internal energy. If, however, the convection is enclosed and circulatory, then it may be regarded as an intermediary that transfers energy as heat between source and destination bodies, because it transfers only energy and not matter from the source to the destination body.\nIn accordance with the first law for closed systems, energy transferred solely as heat leaves one body and enters another, changing the internal energies of each. Transfer, between bodies, of energy as work is a complementary way of changing internal energies. Though it is not logically rigorous from the viewpoint of strict physical concepts, a common form of words that expresses this is to say that heat and work are interconvertible.\nCyclically operating engines that use only heat and work transfers have two thermal reservoirs, a hot and a cold one. They may be classified by the range of operating temperatures of the working body, relative to those reservoirs. In a heat engine, the working body is at all times colder than the hot reservoir and hotter than the cold reservoir. In a sense, it uses heat transfer to produce work. In a heat pump, the working body, at stages of the cycle, goes both hotter than the hot reservoir, and colder than the cold reservoir. In a sense, it uses work to produce heat transfer.\n\n\n=== Heat engine ===\nIn classical thermodynamics, a commonly considered model is the heat engine. It consists of four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state, and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often. Work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible, and thus only one work reservoir is needed. But two thermal reservoirs are needed, because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible. A single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the hot reservoir and sent to the two other reservoirs, the work reservoir and the cold reservoir. The hot reservoir always and only supplies energy, and the cold reservoir always and only receives energy. The second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir. Heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the ratio of the initial and final temperature is greater.\n\n\n=== Heat pump or refrigerator ===\nAnother commonly considered model is the heat pump or refrigerator. Again there are four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir, and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir. Then the work reservoir does work on the working body, adding more to its internal energy, making it hotter than the hot reservoir. The hot working body passes heat to the hot reservoir, but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir. Then, by allowing it to expand without passing heat to another body, the working body is made colder than the cold reservoir. It can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir to start another cycle.\nThe device has transported energy from a colder to a hotter reservoir, but this is not regarded as by an inanimate agency; rather, it is regarded as by the harnessing of work . This is because work is supplied from the work reservoir, not just by a simple thermodynamic process, but by a cycle of thermodynamic operations and processes, which may be regarded as directed by an animate or harnessing agency. Accordingly, the cycle is still in accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The 'efficiency' of a heat pump (which exceeds unity) is best when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is least.\nFunctionally, such engines are used in two ways, distinguishing a target reservoir and a resource or surrounding reservoir. A heat pump transfers heat to the hot reservoir as the target from the resource or surrounding reservoir. A refrigerator transfers heat, from the cold reservoir as the target, to the resource or surrounding reservoir. The target reservoir may be regarded as leaking: when the target leaks heat to the surroundings, heat pumping is used; when the target leaks coldness to the surroundings, refrigeration is used. The engines harness work to overcome the leaks.\n\n\n=== Macroscopic view ===\n\nAccording to Planck, there are three main conceptual approaches to heat. One is the microscopic or kinetic theory approach. The other two are macroscopic approaches. One of the macroscopic approaches is through the law of conservation of energy taken as prior to thermodynamics, with a mechanical analysis of processes, for example in the work of Helmholtz. This mechanical view is taken in this article as currently customary for thermodynamic theory. The other macroscopic approach is the thermodynamic one, which admits heat as a primitive concept, which contributes, by scientific induction to knowledge of the law of conservation of energy. This view is widely taken as the practical one, quantity of heat being measured by calorimetry.\nBailyn also distinguishes the two macroscopic approaches as the mechanical and the thermodynamic. The thermodynamic view was taken by the founders of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century. It regards quantity of energy transferred as heat as a primitive concept coherent with a primitive concept of temperature, measured primarily by calorimetry. A calorimeter is a body in the surroundings of the system, with its own temperature and internal energy; when it is connected to the system by a path for heat transfer, changes in it measure heat transfer. The mechanical view was pioneered by Helmholtz and developed and used in the twentieth century, largely through the influence of Max Born. It regards quantity of heat transferred as heat as a derived concept, defined for closed systems as quantity of heat transferred by mechanisms other than work transfer, the latter being regarded as primitive for thermodynamics, defined by macroscopic mechanics. According to Born, the transfer of internal energy between open systems that accompanies transfer of matter \"cannot be reduced to mechanics\". It follows that there is no well-founded definition of quantities of energy transferred as heat or as work associated with transfer of matter.\nNevertheless, for the thermodynamical description of non-equilibrium processes, it is desired to consider the effect of a temperature gradient established by the surroundings across the system of interest when there is no physical barrier or wall between system and surroundings, that is to say, when they are open with respect to one another. The impossibility of a mechanical definition in terms of work for this circumstance does not alter the physical fact that a temperature gradient causes a diffusive flux of internal energy, a process that, in the thermodynamic view, might be proposed as a candidate concept for transfer of energy as heat.\nIn this circumstance, it may be expected that there may also be active other drivers of diffusive flux of internal energy, such as gradient of chemical potential which drives transfer of matter, and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis; such effects usually interact with diffusive flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient, and such interactions are known as cross-effects.\nIf cross-effects that result in diffusive transfer of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers, they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient, never up one. They would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of one and the same kind, a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems. One might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of diffusive internal energy flux, in the thermodynamic view, the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed. In these circumstances, if perchance it happens that no transfer of matter is actualized, and there are no cross-effects, then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide, as if one were dealing with closed systems. But when there is transfer of matter, the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux of internal energy, rather than being exactly knowable, mostly need to be assumed, and in many cases are practically unverifiable. Consequently, when there is transfer of matter, the calculation of the pure 'heat flux' component of the diffusive flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions. This is a reason to think of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems, and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems.\nIn many writings in this context, the term \"heat flux\" is used when what is meant is therefore more accurately called diffusive flux of internal energy; such usage of the term \"heat flux\" is a residue of older and now obsolete language usage that allowed that a body may have a \"heat content\".\n\n\n=== Microscopic view ===\nIn the kinetic theory, heat is explained in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles, such as electrons, atoms, and molecules. The immediate meaning of the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is not as heat. It is as a component of internal energy.\nIn microscopic terms, heat is a transfer quantity, and is described by a transport theory, not as steadily localized kinetic energy of particles. Heat transfer arises from temperature gradients or differences, through the diffuse exchange of microscopic kinetic and potential particle energy, by particle collisions and other interactions. An early and vague expression of this was made by Francis Bacon. Precise and detailed versions of it were developed in the nineteenth century.\nIn statistical mechanics, for a closed system (no transfer of matter), heat is the energy transfer associated with a disordered, microscopic action on the system, associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system, without change in the values of the energy levels themselves. It is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves, but what distinguishes transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered, microscopic action, including radiative transfer. A mathematical definition can be formulated for small increments of quasi-static adiabatic work in terms of the statistical distribution of an ensemble of microstates.\n\n\n=== Calorimetry ===\n\nQuantity of heat transferred can be measured by calorimetry, or determined through calculations based on other quantities.\nCalorimetry is the empirical basis of the idea of quantity of heat transferred in a process. The transferred heat is measured by changes in a body of known properties, for example, temperature rise, change in volume or length, or phase change, such as melting of ice.\nA calculation of quantity of heat transferred can rely on a hypothetical quantity of energy transferred as adiabatic work and on the first law of thermodynamics. Such calculation is the primary approach of many theoretical studies of quantity of heat transferred.\n\n\n=== Engineering ===\n\nThe discipline of heat transfer, typically considered an aspect of mechanical engineering and chemical engineering, deals with specific applied methods by which thermal energy in a system is generated, or converted, or transferred to another system. Although the definition of heat implicitly means the transfer of energy, the term heat transfer encompasses this traditional usage in many engineering disciplines and laymen language.\nHeat transfer is generally described as including the mechanisms of heat conduction, heat convection, thermal radiation, but may include mass transfer and heat in processes of phase changes.\nConvection may be described as the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow. From the thermodynamic point of view, heat flows into a fluid by diffusion to increase its energy, the fluid then transfers (advects) this increased internal energy (not heat) from one location to another, and this is then followed by a second thermal interaction which transfers heat to a second body or system, again by diffusion. This entire process is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer, although technically, \"heat transfer\" and thus heating and cooling occurs only on either end of such a conductive flow, but not as a result of flow. Thus, conduction can be said to \"transfer\" heat only as a net result of the process, but may not do so at every time within the complicated convective process.\n\n\n== Latent and sensible heat ==\n\nIn an 1847 lecture entitled On Matter, Living Force, and Heat, James Prescott Joule characterized the terms latent heat and sensible heat as components of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena, namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles, respectively.\nHe described latent energy as the energy possessed via a distancing of particles where attraction was over a greater distance, i.e. a form of potential energy, and the sensible heat as an energy involving the motion of particles, i.e. kinetic energy.\nLatent heat is the heat released or absorbed by a chemical substance or a thermodynamic system during a change of state that occurs without a change in temperature. Such a process may be a phase transition, such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water.\n\n\n== Heat capacity ==\nHeat capacity is a measurable physical quantity equal to the ratio of the heat added to an object to the resulting temperature change. The molar heat capacity is the heat capacity per unit amount (SI unit: mole) of a pure substance, and the specific heat capacity, often called simply specific heat, is the heat capacity per unit mass of a material. Heat capacity is a physical property of a substance, which means that it depends on the state and properties of the substance under consideration.\nThe specific heats of monatomic gases, such as helium, are nearly constant with temperature. Diatomic gases such as hydrogen display some temperature dependence, and triatomic gases (e.g., carbon dioxide) still more.\nBefore the development of the laws of thermodynamics, heat was measured by changes in the states of the participating bodies.\nSome general rules, with important exceptions, can be stated as follows.\nIn general, most bodies expand on heating. In this circumstance, heating a body at a constant volume increases the pressure it exerts on its constraining walls, while heating at a constant pressure increases its volume.\nBeyond this, most substances have three ordinarily recognized states of matter, solid, liquid, and gas. Some can also exist in a plasma. Many have further, more finely differentiated, states of matter, such as glass and liquid crystal. In many cases, at fixed temperature and pressure, a substance can exist in several distinct states of matter in what might be viewed as the same 'body'. For example, ice may float in a glass of water. Then the ice and the water are said to constitute two phases within the 'body'. Definite rules are known, telling how distinct phases may coexist in a 'body'. Mostly, at a fixed pressure, there is a definite temperature at which heating causes a solid to melt or evaporate, and a definite temperature at which heating causes a liquid to evaporate. In such cases, cooling has the reverse effects.\nAll of these, the commonest cases, fit with a rule that heating can be measured by changes of state of a body. Such cases supply what are called thermometric bodies, that allow the definition of empirical temperatures. Before 1848, all temperatures were defined in this way. There was thus a tight link, apparently logically determined, between heat and temperature, though they were recognized as conceptually thoroughly distinct, especially by Joseph Black in the later eighteenth century.\nThere are important exceptions. They break the obviously apparent link between heat and temperature. They make it clear that empirical definitions of temperature are contingent on the peculiar properties of particular thermometric substances, and are thus precluded from the title 'absolute'. For example, water contracts on being heated near 277 K. It cannot be used as a thermometric substance near that temperature. Also, over a certain temperature range, ice contracts on heating. Moreover, many substances can exist in metastable states, such as with negative pressure, that survive only transiently and in very special conditions. Such facts, sometimes called 'anomalous', are some of the reasons for the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature.\nIn the early days of measurement of high temperatures, another factor was important, and used by Josiah Wedgwood in his pyrometer. The temperature reached in a process was estimated by the shrinkage of a sample of clay. The higher the temperature, the more the shrinkage. This was the only available more or less reliable method of measurement of temperatures above 1000 °C (1,832 °F). But such shrinkage is irreversible. The clay does not expand again on cooling. That is why it could be used for the measurement. But only once. It is not a thermometric material in the usual sense of the word.\nNevertheless, the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature does make essential use of the concept of heat, with proper circumspection.\n\n\n== \"Hotness\" ==\nThe property of hotness is a concern of thermodynamics that should be defined without reference to the concept of heat. Consideration of hotness leads to the concept of empirical temperature. All physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others. With reference to hotness, the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder.\nIf a physical system is inhomogeneous or very rapidly or irregularly changing, for example by turbulence, it may be impossible to characterize it by a temperature, but still there can be transfer of energy as heat between it and another system. If a system has a physical state that is regular enough, and persists long enough to allow it to reach thermal equilibrium with a specified thermometer, then it has a temperature according to that thermometer. An empirical thermometer registers degree of hotness for such a system. Such a temperature is called empirical. For example, Truesdell writes about classical thermodynamics: \"At each time, the body is assigned a real number called the temperature. This number is a measure of how hot the body is.\"\nPhysical systems that are too turbulent to have temperatures may still differ in hotness. A physical system that passes heat to another physical system is said to be the hotter of the two. More is required for the system to have a thermodynamic temperature. Its behavior must be so regular that its empirical temperature is the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled thermometers, and then its hotness is said to lie on the one-dimensional hotness manifold. This is part of the reason why heat is defined following Carathéodory and Born, solely as occurring other than by work or transfer of matter; temperature is advisedly and deliberately not mentioned in this now widely accepted definition.\nThis is also the reason that the zeroth law of thermodynamics is stated explicitly. If three physical systems, A, B, and C are each not in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, it is possible that, with suitable physical connections being made between them, A can heat B and B can heat C and C can heat A. In non-equilibrium situations, cycles of flow are possible. It is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of internal thermodynamic equilibrium that this possibility is not open to thermodynamic systems (as distinguished amongst physical systems) which are in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium; this is the reason why the zeroth law of thermodynamics needs explicit statement. That is to say, the relation 'is not colder than' between general non-equilibrium physical systems is not transitive, whereas, in contrast, the relation 'has no lower a temperature than' between thermodynamic systems in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is transitive. It follows from this that the relation 'is in thermal equilibrium with' is transitive, which is one way of stating the zeroth law.\nJust as temperature may be undefined for a sufficiently inhomogeneous system, so also may entropy be undefined for a system not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, 'the temperature of the Solar System' is not a defined quantity. Likewise, 'the entropy of the Solar System' is not defined in classical thermodynamics. It has not been possible to define non-equilibrium entropy, as a simple number for a whole system, in a clearly satisfactory way.\n\n\n== Classical thermodynamics ==\n\n\n=== Heat and enthalpy ===\n\nFor a closed system (a system from which no matter can enter or exit), one version of the first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy ΔU of the system is equal to the amount of heat Q supplied to the system minus the amount of thermodynamic work W done by system on its surroundings. The foregoing sign convention for work is used in the present article, but an alternate sign convention, followed by IUPAC, for work, is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings as positive. This is the convention adopted by many modern textbooks of physical chemistry, such as those by Peter Atkins and Ira Levine, but many textbooks on physics define work as work done by the system.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        U\n        =\n        Q\n        −\n        W\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta U=Q-W\\,.}\n  \n\nThis formula can be re-written so as to express a definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat, based purely on the concept of adiabatic work, if it is supposed that ΔU is defined and measured solely by processes of adiabatic work:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Q\n        =\n        Δ\n        U\n        +\n        W\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Q=\\Delta U+W.}\n  \n\nThe thermodynamic work done by the system is through mechanisms defined by its thermodynamic state variables, for example, its volume V, not through variables that necessarily involve mechanisms in the surroundings. The latter are such as shaft work, and include isochoric work.\nThe internal energy, U, is a state function. In cyclical processes, such as the operation of a heat engine, state functions of the working substance return to their initial values upon completion of a cycle.\nThe differential, or infinitesimal increment, for the internal energy in an infinitesimal process is an exact differential dU. The symbol for exact differentials is the lowercase letter d.\nIn contrast, neither of the infinitesimal increments δQ nor δW in an infinitesimal process represents the change in a state function of the system. Thus, infinitesimal increments of heat and work are inexact differentials. The lowercase Greek letter delta, δ, is the symbol for inexact differentials. The integral of any inexact differential in a process where the system leaves and then returns to the same thermodynamic state does not necessarily equal zero.\nAs recounted above, in the section headed heat and entropy, the second law of thermodynamics observes that if heat is supplied to a system in a reversible process, the increment of heat δQ and the temperature T form the exact differential\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n        \n        S\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              δ\n              Q\n            \n            T\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} S={\\frac {\\delta Q}{T}},}\n  \n\nand that S, the entropy of the working body, is a state function.

This is the basis of the determination of enthalpy changes in chemical reactions by calorimetry. Since many processes do take place at constant atmospheric pressure, the enthalpy is sometimes given the misleading name of 'heat content' or heat function, while it actually depends strongly on the energies of covalent bonds and intermolecular forces.\nIn terms of the natural variables S and P of the state function H, this process of change of state from state 1 to state 2 can be expressed

of matter do not occur, defined the second fundamental theorem (the second law of thermodynamics) in the mechanical theory of heat (thermodynamics): \"if two transformations which, without necessitating any other permanent change, can mutually replace one another, be called equivalent, then the generations of the quantity of heat Q from work at the temperature T, has the

work being done, there are changes of entropy in both the surroundings which lose heat and the system which gains it. The increase, ΔS, of entropy in the system may be considered to consist of two parts, an increment, ΔS′ that matches, or 'compensates', the change, −ΔS′, of entropy in the surroundings, and a further increment, ΔS′′ that may be considered to be 'generated' or 'produced' in the system, and is said therefore to be 'uncompensated'.

Because entropy is not a conserved quantity, this is an exception to the general way of speaking, in which an amount transferred is of a conserved quantity.\nFrom the second law of thermodynamics it follows that in a spontaneous transfer of heat, in which the temperature of the system is different from that of the surroundings:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        \n          S\n          \n            \n              o\n              v\n              e\n              r\n              a\n              l\n              l\n            \n          \n        \n        >\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta S_{\\mathrm {overall} }>0.}\n  \n\nFor purposes of mathematical analysis of transfers, one thinks of fictive processes that are called reversible, with the temperature T of the system being hardly less than that of the surroundings, and the transfer taking place at an imperceptibly slow rate.\nFollowing the definition above in formula (1), for such a fictive reversible process, a quantity of transferred heat δQ (an inexact differential) is analyzed as a quantity T dS, with dS (an exact differential):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        \n        \n          d\n        \n        S\n        =\n        δ\n        Q\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T\\,\\mathrm {d} S=\\delta Q.}\n  \n\nThis equality is only valid for a fictive transfer in which there is no production of entropy, that is to say, in which there is no uncompensated entropy.\nIf, in contrast, the process is natural, and can really occur, with irreversibility, then there is entropy production, with dSuncompensated > 0.

    "description": "Meditations (Koine Greek: Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν, romanized: Ta eis heauton, lit. ''Things Unto Himself'') is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 161–180 CE, recording his private notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy.",
    "full_narrative": "Meditations (Koine Greek: Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν, romanized: Ta eis heauton, lit. ''Things Unto Himself'') is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor from 161–180 CE, recording his private notes to himself and ideas on Stoic philosophy.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nMarcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in Koine Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns in AD 170–180. A portion of his work was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes reveal that the first book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron in Slovakia) and the second book was written at Carnuntum.\nIt is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published. The work has no official title, so \"Meditations\" is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.\n\n\n== Structure and themes ==\n\nThe Meditations is divided into 12 books that chronicle different periods of Aurelius' life. The passages in each book are not necessarily in chronological order, seeing as they were written as Aurelius' own personal musings. The style of writing that permeates the text is one that is simplified, straightforward, and perhaps reflecting Aurelius' Stoic perspective.\n\nA central theme to Meditations is the importance of analyzing one's judgment of self and others and developing a cosmic perspective:You have the power to strip away many superfluous troubles located wholly in your judgment, and to possess a large room for yourself embracing in thought the whole cosmos, to consider everlasting time, to think of the rapid change in the parts of each thing, of how short it is from birth until dissolution, and how the void before birth and that after dissolution are equally infinite. Aurelius advocates finding one's place in the universe and sees that everything came from nature, and so everything shall return to it in due time. Another strong theme is of maintaining focus and to be without distraction all the while maintaining strong ethical principles such as \"Being a good man.\"\nHis Stoic ideas often involve avoiding indulgence in sensory affections, a skill which will free a man from the pains and pleasures of the material world. He claims that the only way a man can be harmed by others is to allow his reaction to overpower him. An internal orderly and rational nature, or logos, permeates and guides all existence. Rationality and clear-mindedness allow one to live in harmony with the logos. This allows one to rise above faulty perceptions of \"good\" and \"bad\"—things out of one's control like fame and wealth are (unlike things in one's control) irrelevant and neither good nor bad.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\n\nThe early history of the Meditations is unknown, and its earliest clear mention by another writer dates from the early 10th century. The historian Herodian, writing in the mid-3rd century, makes mention of Marcus' literary legacy, saying \"He was concerned with all aspects of excellence, and in his love of ancient literature he was second to no man, Roman or Greek; this is evident from all his sayings and writings which have come down to us\", a passage which may refer to the Meditations. The Historia Augusta's biography of Avidius Cassius, thought to have been written in the 4th century, records that before Marcus set out on the Marcomannic Wars, he was asked to publish his Precepts of Philosophy in case something should befall him, but he instead \"for three days discussed the books of his Exhortations one after the other\". A doubtful mention is made by the orator Themistius in about 364 C.E. In an address to the emperor Valens, On Brotherly Love, he says: \"You do not need the exhortations (Greek: παραγγέλματα) of Marcus.\" Another possible reference, in the Greek Anthology, is an epigram dedicated to \"the Book of Marcus,\" which has been attributed to the 7th century Byzantine scholar Theophylact Simocatta.\n\n\n=== Medieval ===\nThe first direct mention of the work comes from Arethas of Caesarea (c. 860–935), a bishop who was a great collector of manuscripts. At some date before 907 he sent a volume of the Meditations to Demetrius, Archbishop of Heracleia, with a letter saying: \"I have had for some time an old copy of the Emperor Marcus' most profitable book, so old indeed that it is altogether falling to pieces.… This I have had copied and am able to hand down to posterity in its new dress.\" Arethas also mentions the work in marginal notes (scholia) to books by Lucian and Dio Chrysostom where he refers to passages in the \"Treatise to Himself\" (Greek: τὰ εἰς ἑαυτὸν ἠθικά), and it was this title which the book bore in the manuscript from which the first printed edition was made in the 16th century. Arethas' own copy has now vanished, but it is thought to be the likely ancestor of the surviving manuscripts. The next mention of the Meditations is in the Suda lexicon published in the late 10th century. The Suda calls the work \"a directing (Greek: ἀγωγή) of his own life by Marcus the Emperor in twelve books,\" which is the first mention of a division of the work into twelve books. The Suda makes use of some thirty quotations taken from books I, III, IV, V, IX, and XI. Around 1150, John Tzetzes, a grammarian of Constantinople, quotes passages from Books IV and V attributing them to Marcus. About 200 years later Nicephorus Callistus (c. 1295–1360) in his Ecclesiastical History writes that \"Marcus Antoninus composed a book for the education of his son Marcus [i.e. Commodus], full of all worldly (Greek: κοσμικῆς) experience and instruction.\" The Meditations is thereafter quoted in many Greek compilations from the 14th to 16th centuries. This, specifically after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, as it was among the Greek texts reintroduced by fleeing scholars to European intellectual circles.\nThe present-day text is based almost entirely upon two manuscripts. One is the Codex Palatinus (P), also known as the Codex Toxitanus (T), that was first published in 1558–59 but is now lost. The other manuscript is the Codex Vaticanus 1950 (A) in the Vatican Library, which passed there from the collection of Stefano Gradi in 1683. This is a 14th-century manuscript which survives in a very corrupt state, and about forty-two lines have dropped out by accidental omissions. Other manuscripts are of little independent value for reconstructing the text. The main ones are the Codex Darmstadtinus 2773 (D) with 112 extracts from books I–IX, and the Codex Parisinus 319 (C) with 29 extracts from Books I–IV.\n\n\n=== Modern ===\n\nThe modern history of the Meditations dates from the issue of the first printed edition (editio princeps) by Wilhelm Xylander in 1558 or 1559. It was published at the instigation of Conrad Gesner and printed by his cousin Andreas Gesner at Zürich. The book was bound with a work by Marinus (Proclus vel De Felicitate, also a first edition). To the Meditations was added a Latin translation by Xylander who also included brief notes. Conrad Gesner stated in his dedicatory letter that he \"received the books of Marcus from the gifted poet Michael Toxites from the library of Otto Heinrich, Prince Palatine\", i.e. from the collection at Heidelberg University. The importance of this edition of the Meditations is that the manuscript from which it was printed is now lost, so that it is one of the two principal sources of all modern texts.\nGilbert Murray compares the work to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Confessions and St. Augustine's Confessions. In the Introduction to his 1964 translation of Meditations, the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact of Stoicism on Christianity. Rees (1992) calls the Meditations \"unendingly moving and inspiring,\" but does not offer them up as works of original philosophy, though he does find an element of Marcus' Stoic philosophy in the philosophical system of Immanuel Kant.\nWen Jiabao, the former Prime Minister of China, has said that he has read the Meditations a hundred times. He also stated that he was \"very deeply impressed\" by the work. It has been described as \"a favorite\" of former United States President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe editio princeps (first print edition) of the original Greek was published by Conrad Gessner and his cousin Andreas in 1559. Both it and the accompanying Latin translation were produced by Wilhelm Xylander. His source was a manuscript from Heidelberg University, provided by Michael Toxites. By 1568, when Xylander completed his second edition, he no longer had access to the source and it has been lost ever since. The first English translation was published in 1634 by Meric Casaubon.\nSome popular English translations include:\n\nFrancis Hutcheson, and James Moore (1742).

    "description": "The Republic (Ancient Greek: Πολιτεία, romanized: Politeia; Latin: De Republica) is a Socratic dialogue authored by Plato around 375 BC, concerning justice (dikaiosúnē), the order and character of the just city-state, and the just man. It is Plato's best-known work, and one of the world's most influential works of philosophy and political theory, both intellectually and historically.\nIn the dialogue, Socrates discusses with various Athenians and foreigners the meaning of justice and whether the just man is happier than the unjust man. He considers the natures of existing regimes and then proposes a series of hypothetical cities in comparison, culminating in Kallipolis (Καλλίπολις), a utopian city-state ruled by a class of philosopher-kings. They also discuss ageing, love, theory of forms, the immortality of the soul, and the role of the philosopher and of poetry in society. The dialogue's setting seems to be the time of the Peloponnesian War.",
    "full_narrative": "The Republic (Ancient Greek: Πολιτεία, romanized: Politeia; Latin: De Republica) is a Socratic dialogue authored by Plato around 375 BC, concerning justice (dikaiosúnē), the order and character of the just city-state, and the just man. It is Plato's best-known work, and one of the world's most influential works of philosophy and political theory, both intellectually and historically.\nIn the dialogue, Socrates discusses with various Athenians and foreigners the meaning of justice and whether the just man is happier than the unjust man. He considers the natures of existing regimes and then proposes a series of hypothetical cities in comparison, culminating in Kallipolis (Καλλίπολις), a utopian city-state ruled by a class of philosopher-kings. They also discuss ageing, love, theory of forms, the immortality of the soul, and the role of the philosopher and of poetry in society. The dialogue's setting seems to be the time of the Peloponnesian War.\n\n\n== Place in Plato's corpus ==\nThe Republic is generally placed in the middle period of Plato's dialogues. However, the distinction of the middle dialogues from the early dialogues is not as clear as the distinction of the late dialogues from all the others. Nonetheless, Ritter, Arnim, and Baron—each adopting separate methodologies—agree that the Republic was well distinguished, along with Parmenides, Phaedrus and Theaetetus.\nThe first book of the Republic, which shares many features with earlier dialogues, is thought to have originally been written as a separate work, with the remaining books were conjoined to it, perhaps with modifications to the original of the first book.\n\n\n== Outline ==\n\n\n=== Book I: Aging, Love, and the Definitions of Justice (327a–354c) ===\n\nSocrates and Glaucon visit Athens' port, Piraeus, when they are invited to join Polemarchus for a dinner and festival. At Polemarchus' house, Socrates encounters Polemarchus' father, Cephalus.\n\n\n==== Cephalus (328e–331d) ====\nIn his first philosophical conversation with the group members, Socrates asks the aged Cephalus, \"is life painful at that age, or what report do you make of it?\" Cephalus answers by saying that many are unhappy about old age because they miss their youth, but he finds that \"old age brings us profound repose and freedom from this and other passions. When the appetites have abated, and their force is diminished, the description of Sophocles is perfectly realized. It is like being delivered from a multitude of furious masters.\" The repose gives him time to dedicate himself to sacrifices and justice so that he is prepared for the afterlife.\nThe discussion then turns to the definition of justice. Cephalus says that justice is honesty and returning to people that which they are owed. Socrates refutes this by arguing that it would not be just to honestly return a borrowed knife to a man who has since gone mad and would harm himself with it.\n\n\n==== Polemarchus (331d–336b) ====\nPolemarchus argues that justice is giving what is appropriate to others — to do good to one's friends and bad to his enemies. Socrates refutes this in four parts, concluding that harming anyone, even one's enemies, in itself creates injustice, and thus cannot appear just.\n\n\n==== Thrasymachus (336b–354c) ====\nThrasymachus then argues that justice is that which is advantageous for the stronger. Socrates responds by posing the scenario where the strong make mistakes that are not advantageous to them. Thrasymachus then responds by claiming that one is stronger when he does not make mistakes as to their advantage. Socrates refutes this with a further argument: Crafts aim at the good of their object, and therefore to rule is for the benefit of the ruled and not the ruler. Thrasymachus then observes that the shepherd, for example, herds his sheep not for their benefit but for his own, and argues that injustice is better than justice, for one who commits undetected injustice to satisfy his own desires is better off than the just person.\nSocrates further observes that a shepherd's concern for his sheep is different from his concern to make money, which is extraneous to the art or craft of shepherding, and that no power or art provides what is beneficial to itself. He claims that the best rulers are reluctant to rule but do so out of necessity: they do not wish to be ruled by someone inferior. Socrates then gives three arguments in favour of the just life over the unjust life, centering around wisdom, harmony, and the soul.\n\n\n=== Book II: Ring of Gyges (357a–383c) ===\nGlaucon and Adeimantus are unsatisfied with Socrates's defense of justice. They ask Socrates to defend justice as a thing good in itself, and not only for its consequences. To demonstrate the problem, he tells the story of Gyges, who – with the help of a ring that turns him invisible – achieves great advantages for himself by committing injustices. Glaucon uses this argument to challenge Socrates to defend the position that the just life is better than the unjust life.\nSocrates suggests that they use the city as an image to seek how justice comes to be in the soul of an individual. After attributing the origin of society to the individual not being self-sufficient and having many needs which he cannot supply himself, Socrates first describes a \"healthy state\" made up of producers who make enough for a modest subsistence, but Glaucon considers this hardly different than \"a city of pigs.\" Socrates then goes on to describe the luxurious city, which he calls \"a fevered state\". Acquiring and defending these luxuries requires a guardian class to wage wars.\nSocrates then asks how the guardians will not become tyrants to the people they guard. He concludes that it is necessary for there to be careful education of the guardians, which education would involve censorship of poetry and stories. For example, he argues that stories that ascribe evil to the gods or heroes or portray the afterlife as bad are untrue and should not be taught.\n\n\n=== Book III: Noble lie (386a–417b) ===\n\nSocrates further describes the program of censored education in such a city: Poetry should be censored in such a way that encourages courage, obedience, cunning, and self-discipline, while discouraging the fear of death, laughter, absolute truthfulness, avarice, or hubris. Further, the guardians will require physical training to prevent illness, benefit the soul, and in preparation for war. From the guardians, the rulers of the city will be selected, which rulers shall act only in the city's advantage. For the citizens to accept their role in society, the rulers must perpetuate a noble lie (γενναῖον ψεῦδος, gennaion pseudos).\nThe noble lie is illustrated by Socrates's myth or parable of the metals. In this version of the noble lie, each human is regarded as either containing gold, silver, or bronze, and, correspondingly, are best suited to rule, guard, or merely produce. Socrates claims that if the people believed \"this myth...[it] would have a good effect, making them more inclined to care for the state and one another.\"\nSocrates then ends with the conditions in which the guardians must live. For example, they shall be prohibited from owning private property, privacy, and wealth, so as to keep their focus on the good of the city.\n\n\n=== Book IV: Kallipolis, cardinal virtues, and the soul (419a–445e) ===\nAt this point, Adeimantus interrupts Socrates, noting that in such situations, the guardians are likely to be unhappy. Socrates argues that in the just city, it is the entire city's happiness that is maximised, and not just that of the guardian class. To achieve this, it is necessary for certain conditions to be satisfied, such as the strict education of the guardians and the rules imposed upon them. Moderation, for example, must be emphasised, since both poverty and excessive wealth will corrupt them. In this ideal city, it would be pointless to worry over specific laws, like those pertaining to contracts, since proper education ensures lawful behavior, and poor education causes lawlessness. Socrates further observes that in such a just city, the guardians will share wives and children.\nHaving established the theory of the just city (Kallipolis), Socrates argues that because the city is completely good and virtuous, it embodies the four cardinal virtues of wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. He then proceeds to search for wisdom, courage, and temperance in the city, on the grounds that justice will be easier to discern in what remains. He finds wisdom among the guardian rulers, courage among the guardian warriors, temperance among all classes of the city in agreeing about who should rule and who should be ruled. Finally, Socrates defines justice in the city as the state in which each class performs only its own work, not meddling in the work of the other classes.\nSocrates then creates an analogy between the parts of the city and the soul. He argues that psychological conflict points to a divided soul, since a completely unified soul could not behave in opposite ways towards the same object, at the same time, and in the same respect. He gives examples of possible conflicts between the rational, spirited, and appetitive parts of the soul, corresponding to the rulers, auxiliaries, and producing classes in the city. Having established the tripartite soul, Socrates defines the virtues of the individual. A person is wise if he is ruled by the part of the soul that sees and knows \"what is beneficial for each part and for the whole,\" courageous if his spirited part \"preserves in the midst of pleasures and pains\" the decisions reached by the rational part, and temperate if the three parts agree that the rational part lead. They are just if each part of the soul attends to its function and not the function of another. It follows from this definition that one cannot be just if one does not have the other cardinal virtues.\nHaving established the theory of justice as a balance between the parts of the soul, Socrates seeks to address the remaining question whether justice is better than unpunished injustice by exposition of a broader political theory.\n\n\n=== Book V (449a–480a): Philosopher-kings and the theory of forms ===\nAt this point, Adeimantus again interrupts Socrates, questioning him on the point about the sharing of wives and children. Socrates is overwhelmed at what he perceives to be an \"ambush\" on his argument.\nHe then goes on to elaborate his theory in detail: In the Kallipolis, both male and female guardians will receive the same education and perform the same roles, for sex is not relevant to the governance of the city. The rulers of the city, nonetheless, should govern sexual intercourse by organising sex festivals in which a rigged lottery will be held, allowing the best male guardians to have sex with as many female citizens as he wants. The subsequent children shall be raised in ignorance of their parents, and vice versa, so that all parents think of all children as their own. Socrates notes the risk of incest.\nSocrates is about to discuss his theory of war, when Glaucon interrupts him, questioning the feasibility of such a city. In response, Socrates concedes the difficulty of establishing such a city but notes the theoretical value of the ideal in discussing concepts of justice and injustice. Nonetheless, Socrates believes that such a city may come into being, but only if ruled by a philosopher, who would thus be known as a philosopher-king. This is because, according to Socrates, only philosophers are unlike persons who merely have opinions, for philosophers have knowledge through their understanding of the Forms.\n\n\n=== Book VI (484a–511e): Ship of State, Form of the Good, and the first two analogies ===\nSocrates continues to argue for why philosophers should rule, when he is interrupted by Adeimantus, who observe that philosophers are corrupt, strange, or useless.\n\n\n==== Ship of State (488a–489d) ====\nSocrates refutes Adeimantus's argument by likening the governance of a city-state to the command of a ship, the Ship of State.\n\n\n==== Form of the Good (505a–505e) ====\nSocrates argues that in the ideal city, a true philosopher with understanding of forms will facilitate the harmonious co-operation of all the citizens of the city. This philosopher-king must be intelligent, reliable, and willing to lead a simple life. However, these qualities are rarely manifested on their own, and so they must be encouraged through education and the study of the Form of the Good.\n\n\n==== The Sun and Divided Line (507c–511e) ====\nSocrates then offers two analogies to illustrate the Form of the Good: that of the Sun and the Divided Line.\n\n\n=== Book VII (514a–541b): Allegory of the cave ===\n\nBuilding from his previous two analogies, Socrates offers the allegory of the cave. The Allegory of the Cave depicts Plato's distinction between the world of appearances and the 'real' world of the Forms.\n\n\n=== Book VIII (543a–569c) ===\nReturning to his earlier point, Socrates categorises governments into five types of regimes: aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny.\nThe starting point is an imagined, alternate, just aristocracy ruled by a philosopher-king. Aristocracy degenerates into timocracy when, due to miscalculation on the part of its governing class, the next generation includes persons of an inferior nature, inclined not just to cultivating virtues but also producing wealth. In a timocracy, governors will apply great effort in gymnastics and the arts of war, as well as the virtue that pertains to them, that of courage. As the emphasis on honor is compromised by wealth accumulation, it is replaced by oligarchy. The oligarchic government is dominated by the desiring element, in which the rich are the ruling class. Oligarchs do, however, value at least one virtue, that of temperance and moderation—not out of an ethical principle or spiritual concern, but because by dominating wasteful tendencies they succeed in accumulating money.\nFrom the conflicts arising out of tensions in an oligarchy, the poor majority overthrow the wealthy minority, and democracy replaces the oligarchy preceding it. In democracy, the lower class grows bigger and bigger. The populism of the democratic government leads to mob rule, fueled by fear of oligarchy, which a clever demagogue can exploit to take power and establish tyranny where no one has discipline and society exists in chaos. In a tyrannical government, the city is enslaved to the tyrant, who uses his guards to remove the best social elements and individuals from the city to retain power, while leaving the worst. He will also provoke warfare to consolidate his position as leader. In this way, tyranny is the most unjust regime of all.\n\n\n=== Book IX (571a–592b) ===\nIn parallel to this, Socrates considers the individual or soul that corresponds to each of these regimes.\nHe describes how an aristocrat may become weak or detached from political and material affluence, and how his son will respond to this by becoming overly ambitious. The timocrat in turn may be defeated by the courts or vested interests; his son responds by accumulating wealth in order to gain power in society and defend himself against the same predicament, thereby becoming an oligarch. The oligarch's son will grow up with wealth without having to practice thrift or stinginess, and will be tempted and overwhelmed by his desires, so that he becomes democratic, valuing freedom above all. The democratic man is torn between tyrannical passions and oligarchic discipline, and ends up in the middle ground: valuing all desires, both good and bad. The tyrant will be tempted in the same way as the democrat, but without an upbringing in discipline or moderation to restrain him. Therefore, his most base desires and wildest passions overwhelm him, and he becomes driven by lust, using force and fraud to take whatever he wants. The tyrant is both a slave to his lusts, and a master to whomever he can enslave.\nSocrates points out the human tendency to be corrupted by power leads down the road to timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny. From this, he concludes that ruling should be left to philosophers, who are the most just and therefore least susceptible to corruption. This \"good city\" is depicted as being governed by philosopher-kings; disinterested persons who rule not for their personal enjoyment but for the good of the city-state (polis). The philosophers have seen the \"Forms\" and therefore know what is good. They understand the corrupting effect of greed and own no property and receive no salary.\n\n\n=== Book X (595a–621d): Myth of Er ===\n\nConcluding a theme brought up most explicitly in the Analogies of the Sun and Divided Line in Book VI, Socrates finally rejects any form of imitative art and concludes that such artists have no place in the just city. He continues on to argue for the immortality of the psyche and espouses a theory of reincarnation. He finishes by detailing the rewards of being just, both in this life and the next. Artists create things but they are only different copies of the idea of the original.\"And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells us this, I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.\"\n\nAnd the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water, and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us like magic.\nHe speaks about illusions and confusion. Things can look very similar, but be different in reality. Because we are human, at times we cannot tell the difference between the two.\n\nAnd does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness—the case of pity is repeated—there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.\nWith all of us, we may approve of something, as long we are not directly involved with it. If we joke about it, we are supporting it.\n\nQuite true, he said.\nAnd the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue.\nSometimes we let our passions rule our actions or way of thinking, although they should be controlled, so that we can increase our happiness.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Greece and Rome ===\n\nAristotle systematises many of Plato's analyses in his Politics, and criticizes the propositions of several political philosophers for the ideal city-state.\nZeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, wrote his version of an ideal society, Zeno's Republic, in opposition to Plato's Republic. Zeno's Republic was controversial and was viewed with some embarrassment by some of the later Stoics due to its defenses of free love, incest, and cannibalism and due to its opposition to ordinary education and the building of temples, law-courts, and gymnasia.\nThe English title of Plato's dialogue is derived from Cicero's De re publica, written some three centuries later. Cicero's dialogue imitates Plato's style and treats many of the same topics, and Cicero's main character Scipio Aemilianus expresses his esteem for Plato and Socrates.\nAugustine of Hippo wrote his The City of God; Augustine equally described a model of the \"ideal city\", in his case the eternal Jerusalem, using a visionary language not unlike that of the preceding philosophers.\nSeveral Oxyrhynchus Papyri fragments were found to contain parts of the Republic, and from other works such as Phaedo, or the dialogue Gorgias, written around 200–300 CE. Fragments of a different version of Plato's Republic were discovered in 1945, part of the Nag Hammadi library, written c. 350 CE. These findings highlight the influence of Plato during those times in Egypt.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\n\n==== Ibn Rushd ====\nIslamic philosophers were much more interested in Aristotle than Plato, but not having access to Aristotle's Politics, Ibn Rushd (Averroes) produced instead a commentary on\nPlato's Republic. He advances an authoritarian ideal, following Plato's paternalistic model. Absolute monarchy, led by a philosopher-king, creates a justly ordered society. This requires extensive use of coercion, although persuasion is preferred and is possible if the young are properly raised. Rhetoric, not logic, is the appropriate road to truth for the common man. Demonstrative knowledge via philosophy and logic requires special study. Rhetoric aids religion in reaching the masses.\nFollowing Plato, Ibn Rushd accepts the principle of women's equality. They should be educated and allowed to serve in the military; the best among them might be tomorrow's philosophers or rulers. He also accepts Plato's illiberal measures such as the censorship of literature. He uses examples from Arab history to illustrate just and degenerate political orders.\n\n\n=== Thomas More ===\nThomas More, when writing his Utopia, invented the technique of using the portrayal of a \"utopia\" as the carrier of his thoughts about the ideal society. More's island Utopia is also similar to Plato's Republic in some aspects, among them common property and the lack of privacy.\n\n\n=== Hegel ===\nHegel respected Plato's theories of state and ethics much more than those of the early modern philosophers such as Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau, whose theories proceeded from a fictional \"state of nature\" defined by humanity's \"natural\" needs, desires and freedom. For Hegel this was a contradiction: since nature and the individual are contradictory, the freedoms which define individuality as such are latecomers on the stage of history. Therefore, these philosophers unwittingly projected man as an individual in modern society onto a primordial state of nature. Plato however had managed to grasp the ideas specific to his time:\n\nPlato is not the man to dabble in abstract theories and principles; his truth-loving mind has recognized and represented the truth of the world in which he lived, the truth of the one spirit that lived in him as in Greece itself.  No man can overleap his time, the spirit of his time is his spirit also; but the point at issue is, to recognize that spirit by its content.\nFor Hegel, Plato's Republic is not an abstract theory or ideal which is too good for the real nature of man, but rather is not ideal enough, not good enough for the ideals already inherent or nascent in the reality of his time; a time when Greece was entering decline. One such nascent idea was about to crush the Greek way of life: modern freedoms—or Christian freedoms in Hegel's view—such as the individual's choice of his social class, or of what property to pursue, or which career to follow. Such individual freedoms were excluded from Plato's Republic:\n\nPlato recognized and caught up the true spirit of his times, and brought it forward in a more definite way, in that he desired to make this new principle an impossibility in his Republic.\nGreece being at a crossroads, Plato's new \"constitution\" in the Republic was an attempt to preserve Greece: it was a reactionary reply to the new freedoms of private property etc., that were eventually given legal form through Rome. Accordingly, in ethical life, it was an attempt to introduce a religion that elevated each individual not as an owner of property, but as the possessor of an immortal soul.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nMussolini admired Plato's Republic, which he often read for inspiration. The Republic expounded a number of ideas that fascism promoted, such as rule by an elite promoting the state as the ultimate end, opposition to democracy, protecting the class system and promoting class collaboration, rejection of egalitarianism, promoting the militarization of a nation by creating a class of warriors, demanding that citizens perform civic duties in the interest of the state, and utilizing state intervention in education to promote the development of warriors and future rulers of the state. Plato was an idealist, focused on achieving justice and morality, while Mussolini and fascism were realist, focused on achieving political goals.\nMartin Luther King Jr. nominated the Republic as the one book he would wish to have on a desert island, aside from the Bible.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001, a survey of over 1,000 academics and students voted the Republic the greatest philosophical text ever written. Julian Baggini argued that although the work \"was wrong on almost every point, the questions it raises and the methods it uses are essential to the western tradition of philosophy. Without it we might not have philosophy as we know it.\" In 2021, a survey showed that the Republic is the most studied book in the top universities in the United States.\n\n\n=== Cultural influence ===\nPlato's Republic has been influential in literature and art.\n\nAldous Huxley's Brave New World has a dystopian government that bears a resemblance to the form of government described in the Republic, featuring the separation of people by professional class, assignment of profession and purpose by the state, and the absence of traditional family units, replaced by state-organized breeding.\nThe Orwellian dystopia depicted in the novel 1984 had many characteristics in common with Plato's description of the allegory of the Cave as Winston Smith strives to liberate himself from it.\nIn the early 1970s the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen composed a vocal work called De Staat, based on the text of Plato's Republic.\nIn Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers, his citizen can be compared to a Platonic Guardian, without the communal breeding and property, but still having a militaristic base. Although there are significant differences in the specifics of the system, Heinlein and Plato both describe systems of limited franchise, with a political class that has supposedly earned their power and wisely governs the whole. The Republic is specifically attacked in Starship Troopers. The arachnids can be seen as much closer to a Republic society than the humans.\nThe film The Matrix models Plato's Allegory of the Cave.\nIn fiction, Jo Walton's 2015 novel The Just City explored the consequences of establishing a city-state based on the Republic in practice.\nSee also Ring of Gyges: Cultural influences\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n\n=== Gadamer ===\nIn his 1934 Plato und die Dichter (Plato and the Poets), as well as several other works, Hans-Georg Gadamer describes the utopic city of the Republic as a heuristic utopia that should not be pursued or even be used as an orientation-point for political development. Rather, its purpose is said to be to show how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another—often with highly problematic results—if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously. This interpretation argues that large passages in Plato's writing are ironic, a line of thought initially pursued by Kierkegaard.\n\n\n=== Popper ===\nThe city portrayed in the Republic struck some critics as harsh, rigid, and unfree; indeed, as totalitarian. Karl Popper gave a voice to that view in his 1945 book The Open Society and Its Enemies, where he singled out Plato's state as a dystopia. Popper distinguished Plato's ideas from those of Socrates, claiming that the former in his later years expressed none of the humanitarian and democratic tendencies of his teacher. Popper thought Plato's envisioned state totalitarian as it advocated a government composed only of a distinct hereditary ruling class, with the working class—who Popper argues Plato regards as \"human cattle\"—given no role in decision making. He argues that Plato has no interest in what are commonly regarded as the problems of justice—the resolution of disputes between individuals—because Plato has redefined justice as \"keeping one's place\".\nPopper insists that the Republic \"was meant by its author not so much as a theoretical treatise, but as a topical political manifesto\", and Bertrand Russell argues that at least in intent, and all in all not so far from what was possible in ancient Greek city-states, the form of government portrayed in the Republic was meant as a practical one by Plato.\n\n\n=== Voegelin ===\nMany critics have suggested that the dialogue's political discussion actually serves as an analogy for the individual soul, in which there are also many different \"members\" that can either conflict or else be integrated and orchestrated under a just and productive \"government.\" Among other things, this analogical reading would solve the problem of certain implausible statements Plato makes concerning an ideal political republic. Norbert Blössner (2007) argues that the Republic is best understood as an analysis of the workings and moral improvement of the individual soul with remarkable thoroughness and clarity. This view, of course, does not preclude a legitimate reading of the Republic as a political treatise (the work could operate at both levels). It merely implies that it deserves more attention as a work on psychology and moral philosophy than it has sometimes received.\nEric Voegelin in Plato and Aristotle (Baton Rouge, 1957), gave meaning to the concept of 'Just City in Speech' (Books II–V). For instance, there is evidence in the dialogue that Socrates himself would not be a member of his 'ideal' state. His life was almost solely dedicated to the private pursuit of knowledge. More practically, Socrates suggests that members of the lower classes could rise to the higher ruling class, and vice versa, if they had 'gold' in their veins—a version of the concept of social mobility. The exercise of power is built on the 'noble lie' that all men are brothers, born of the earth, yet there is a clear hierarchy and class divisions. There is a tripartite explanation of human psychology that is extrapolated to the city, the relation among peoples. There is no family among the guardians, another crude version of Max Weber's concept of bureaucracy as the state non-private concern. Together with Leo Strauss, Voegelin considered Popper's interpretation to be a gross misunderstanding not only of the dialogue itself, but of the very nature and character of Plato's entire philosophic enterprise.\nThe paradigm of the city—the idea of the Good, the Agathon—has manifold historical embodiments, undertaken by those who have seen the Agathon, and are ordered via the vision. The centerpiece of the Republic, Part II, nos. 2–3, discusses the rule of the philosopher, and the vision of the Agathon with the Allegory of the Cave, which is clarified in the theory of forms. The centerpiece is preceded and followed by the discussion of the means that will secure a well-ordered polis (city). Part II, no. 1, concerns marriage, the community of people and goods for the guardians, and the restraints on warfare among the Hellenes. It describes a partially communistic polis. Part II, no. 4, deals with the philosophical education of the rulers who will preserve the order and character of the city-state.\nIn part II, the Embodiment of the Idea, is preceded by the establishment of the economic and social orders of a polis (part I), followed by an analysis (part III) of the decline the order must traverse. The three parts compose the main body of the dialogues, with their discussions of the \"paradigm\", its embodiment, its genesis, and its decline.\nThe introduction and the conclusion are the frame for the body of the Republic. The discussion of right order is occasioned by the questions: \"Is justice better than injustice?\" and \"Will an unjust man fare better than a just man?\" The introductory question is balanced by the concluding answer: \"Justice is preferable to injustice\". In turn, the foregoing are framed with the Prologue (Book I) and the Epilogue (Book X). The prologue is a short dialogue about the common public doxai (opinions) about justice. Based upon faith, and not reason, the Epilogue describes the new arts and the immortality of the soul.\n\n\n=== Strauss and Bloom ===\nSome of Plato's proposals have led theorists like Leo Strauss and Allan Bloom to ask readers to consider the possibility that Socrates was creating not a blueprint for a real city, but a learning exercise for the young men in the dialogue. There are many points in the construction of the \"Just City in Speech\" that seem contradictory, which raise the possibility Socrates is employing irony to make the men in the dialogue question for themselves the ultimate value of the proposals. In turn, Plato has immortalized this 'learning exercise' in the Republic.\nOne of many examples is that Socrates calls the marriages of the ruling class 'sacred'; however, they last only one night and are the result of manipulating and drugging couples into predetermined intercourse with the aim of eugenically breeding guardian-warriors. Strauss and Bloom's interpretations, however, involve more than just pointing out inconsistencies; by calling attention to these issues they ask readers to think more deeply about whether Plato is being ironic or genuine, for neither Strauss nor Bloom present an unequivocal opinion, preferring to raise philosophic doubt over interpretive fact.\nStrauss's approach developed out of a belief that Plato wrote esoterically. The basic acceptance of the exoteric-esoteric distinction revolves around whether Plato really wanted to see the \"Just City in Speech\" of Books V–VI come to pass, or whether it is just an allegory. Strauss never regarded this as the crucial issue of the dialogue. He argued against Karl Popper's literal view, citing Cicero's opinion that the Republic's true nature was to bring to light the nature of political things. In fact, Strauss undermines the justice found in the \"Just City in Speech\" by implying the city is not natural, it is a man-made conceit that abstracts away from the erotic needs of the body. The city founded in the Republic \"is rendered possible by the abstraction from eros\".\nAn argument that has been used against ascribing ironic intent to Plato is that Plato's Academy produced a number of tyrants who seized political power and abandoned philosophy for ruling a city. Despite being well-versed in Greek and having direct contact with Plato himself, some of Plato's former students like Clearchus, tyrant of Heraclea; Chaeron, tyrant of Pellene; Erastus and Coriscus, tyrants of Skepsis; Hermias of Atarneus and Assos; and Calippus, tyrant of Syracuse ruled people and did not impose anything like a philosopher-kingship. However, it can be argued whether these men became \"tyrants\" through studying in the academy. Plato's school had an elite student body, some of whom would by birth, and family expectation, end up in the seats of power. Additionally, it is important that it is by no means obvious that these men were tyrants in the modern, totalitarian sense of the concept. Finally, since very little is actually known about what was taught at Plato's Academy, there is no small controversy over whether it was even in the business of teaching politics at all.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nDavies, J.

In its use of near-contemporary Italians as examples of people who perpetrated criminal deeds for political ends, another lesser-known work by Machiavelli to which The Prince has been compared is the Life of Castruccio Castracani.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nEach part of The Prince has attracted extensive commentary over centuries. Machiavelli's writings continue to provoke examination of leadership and government, posing age-old issues regarding the nature of power and the decisions that rulers must make to preserve it.\n\n\n=== Letter to Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino ===\nMachiavelli prefaces his work with an introductory letter to Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino, the recipient of his work.\n\n\n=== The subject matter: New Princedoms (Chapters 1 and 2) ===\nThe Prince starts by describing its subject. In the first sentence, Machiavelli uses the word \"state\" (Italian stato, which could also mean \"status\")  to cover, in neutral terms, \"all forms of organization of supreme political power, whether republican or princely\". How the word \"state\" acquired its modern meaning during the Renaissance has been the subject of much academic debate, with this sentence and similar ones in the works of Machiavelli being considered particularly important.\nMachiavelli explained here that The Prince is about princedoms, indicating that he has written about republics elsewhere, which is a reference to the Discourses on Livy. Commentators note that in fact he mixes discussion of republics into this work in many places, effectively treating republics as a type of princedom with many strengths. More importantly, and less traditionally, he distinguishes new princedoms from established hereditary princedoms. He deals with hereditary princedoms quickly in Chapter 2, saying that they are much easier to rule. For such a prince, \"unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him\". Gilbert (1938:19–23), comparing this claim to traditional presentations of advice for princes, wrote that the novelty in chapters 1 and 2 is the \"deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom\". Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. He thinks Machiavelli may have been influenced by Tacitus as well as his own experience.\nThis categorization of regime types is also \"un-Aristotelian\" and apparently simpler than the traditional one found for example in Aristotle's Politics, which divides regimes into those ruled by a single monarch, an oligarchy, or by the people, in a democracy. Machiavelli also ignores the classical distinctions between the good and corrupt forms, for example, between monarchy and tyranny.\n\n\n=== \"Mixed\" princedoms (Chapters 3–5) ===\nNew princedoms are either totally new or they are \"mixed\", meaning that they are new parts of an older state, already belonging to that prince.\n\n\n==== New conquests added to older states (Chapter 3) ====\nMachiavelli generalizes that there were several virtuous Roman ways to hold a newly acquired province, using a republic as an example of how new princes can act:\n\nto install one's princedom in the new acquisition, or to install colonies of one's people there, which is better.\nto indulge the lesser powers of the area without increasing their power.\nto put down the powerful people.\nnot to allow a foreign power to gain reputation.\nMore generally, Machiavelli emphasizes that one should have regard not only for present problems but also for the future ones. One should not \"enjoy the benefit of time\", but rather the benefit of one's virtue and prudence, because time can bring evil, as well as good.\nMachiavelli notes in this chapter on the \"natural and ordinary desire to acquire\" and as such, those who act on this desire can be \"praised or blamed\" depending on the success of their acquisitions. He then goes into detail about how the King of France failed in his conquest of Italy, even saying how he could have succeeded. Machiavelli views doing harm to enemies as a necessity, stating, \"if an injury is to be done to a man, it should be so severe that the prince is not in fear of revenge\".\n\n\n==== Conquered kingdoms (Chapter 4) ====\n \nIn some cases, the old king of the conquered kingdom depended on his lords; 16th-century France, or in other words France as it was at the time of writing of The Prince, is given by Machiavelli as an example of such a kingdom. These are easy to enter, but difficult to hold.\nWhen the kingdom revolves around the king, with everyone else his servant, then it is difficult to enter, but easy to hold. The solution is to eliminate the old bloodline of the prince. Machiavelli used the Persian empire of Darius III, conquered by Alexander the Great, to illustrate this point, and then noted that if one considers it, they will find this historical example similar to the \"kingdom of the Turk\" (Ottoman Empire) in their time – making this a potentially easier conquest to hold than France would be.\n\n\n==== Conquered free states, with their own laws and orders (Chapter 5) ====\nGilbert (1938:34) notes that this chapter is quite atypical of any previous books for princes. Gilbert supposed the need to discuss conquering free republics is linked to Machiavelli's project to unite Italy, which contained some free republics. As he also notes, the chapter in any case makes it clear that holding such a state is highly difficult for a prince. Machiavelli gives three options:\n\nRuin them, as Rome destroyed Carthage, and also as Machiavelli says the Romans eventually had to do in Greece.\nGo to live there and rule it personally.\nKeep the state intact, but install an oligarchy.\nMachiavelli advises the ruler to go the first route, stating that if a prince does not destroy a city, he can expect \"to be destroyed by it\".\n\n\n=== Totally new states (Chapters 6–9) ===\n\n\n==== Conquests by virtue (Chapter 6) ====\n\nPrinces who rise to power through their own skill and resources (virtù) rather than luck (fortuna) tend to have a hard time rising to the top, but once they reach the top they are very secure in their position. This is because they effectively crush their opponents and earn great respect from everyone else. Because they are strong and more self-sufficient, they have to make fewer compromises with their allies.\nMachiavelli writes that reforming an existing order is one of the most dangerous and difficult things a prince can do. Part of the reason is that people are naturally resistant to change and reform. Those who benefited from the old order will resist change very fiercely, and those who may stand to benefit from the new order will be less enthusiastic in their support, because the new order is unfamiliar and they are not certain it will live up to its promises.  Moreover, it is impossible for the prince to satisfy everybody's expectations. Inevitably, he will disappoint some of his followers. Therefore, a prince must have the means to force his supporters to keep supporting him even when they start having second thoughts, otherwise he will lose his power. Only armed prophets, like Moses, succeed in bringing lasting change. Machiavelli claims that Moses killed uncountable numbers of his own people in order to enforce his will.\nMachiavelli was not the first thinker to notice this pattern. Allan Gilbert wrote: \"In wishing new laws and yet seeing danger in them Machiavelli was not himself an innovator,\" because this idea was traditional and could be found in Aristotle's writings. But Machiavelli went much further than any other author in his emphasis on this aim, and Gilbert associates Machiavelli's emphasis upon such drastic aims with the level of corruption to be found in Italy.\n\n\n==== Conquest by fortune, meaning by someone else's virtue (Chapter 7) ====\nAccording to Machiavelli, when a prince comes to power through luck or the blessings of powerful figures within the regime, he typically has an easy time gaining power but a hard time keeping it thereafter, because his power is dependent on his benefactors' goodwill. He does not command the loyalty of the armies and officials that maintain his authority, and these can be withdrawn from him at a whim. Having risen the easy way, it is not even certain that such a prince has the skill and strength to stand on his own feet.\nThis is not necessarily true in every case.  Machiavelli cites Cesare Borgia as an example of a lucky prince who escaped this pattern.  Through cunning political maneuvers, he managed to secure his power base.  Cesare was made commander of the papal armies by his father, Pope Alexander VI, but was also heavily dependent on mercenary armies loyal to the Orsini brothers and the support of the French king.  Borgia won over the allegiance of the Orsini brothers' followers with better pay and prestigious government posts. To pacify the Romagna, he sent in his henchman, Remirro de Orco, to commit acts of violence. When Remirro started to become hated for his actions, Borgia responded by ordering him to be \"cut in two\" to show the people that the cruelty was not from him, although it was. When some of his mercenary captains started to plot against him, he had them captured and executed. When it looked as though the king of France would abandon him, Borgia sought new alliances.\nFinally, Machiavelli makes a point that bringing new benefits to a conquered people will not be enough to cancel the memory of old injuries, an idea Allan Gilbert said can be found in Tacitus and Seneca the Younger.\n\n\n==== Of Those Who Have Obtained a Principality Through Crimes (Chapter 8) ====\nConquests by \"criminal virtue\" are ones in which the new prince secures his power through cruel, immoral deeds, such as the elimination of political rivals.\nMachiavelli offers two rulers to imitate, Agathocles of Syracuse and Oliverotto Euffreducci. After Agathocles became Praetor of Syracuse, he called a meeting of the city's elite. At his signal, his soldiers killed all the senators and the wealthiest citizens, completely destroying the old oligarchy. He declared himself ruler with no opposition. So secure was his power that he could afford to absent himself to go off on military campaigns in Africa.\nMachiavelli then states that the behavior of Agathocles is not simply virtue, as he says, \"Yet one cannot call it virtue to kill one's citizens, betray one's friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; these modes can enable one to acquire empire, but not glory. [...] Nonetheless, his savage cruelty and inhumanity, together with his infinite crimes, do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men.  Thus, one cannot attribute to fortune or virtue what he achieved without either.\"\nMachiavelli then goes to his next example, Oliverotto de Fermo, an Italian condottiero who recently came to power by killing all his enemies, including his uncle Giovanni Fogliani, at a banquet. After he laid siege to the governing council and terrified the citizenry, he then set up a government with himself as absolute ruler. However, in an ironic twist, Oliverotto was killed the same way his opponents were, as Cesare Borgia had him strangled after he invited Oliverotto and Vitellozzo Vitelli to a friendly setting.\nMachiavelli advises that a prince should carefully calculate all the wicked deeds he needs to do to secure his power, and then execute them all in one stroke. In this way, his subjects will slowly forget his cruel deeds and the prince can better align himself with his subjects. Princes who fail to do this, who hesitate in their ruthlessness, will have to \"keep a knife by his side\" and protect himself at all costs, as he can never trust himself amongst his subjects.\nGilbert (1938:51–55) remarks that this chapter is even less traditional than those it follows, not only in its treatment of criminal behavior, but also in the advice to take power from people at a stroke, noting that precisely the opposite had been advised by Aristotle in his Politics (5.11.1315a13). On the other hand, Gilbert shows that another piece of advice in this chapter, to give benefits when it will not appear forced, was traditional.\n\n\n==== Becoming a prince by the selection of one's fellow citizens (Chapter 9) ====\nA \"civil principality\" is one in which a citizen comes to power \"not through crime or other intolerable violence\", but by the support of his fellow citizens. This, he says, does not require extreme virtue or fortune, only \"fortunate astuteness\". For this is one of the four means of coming about a principality (the other three being by virtue, fortune, and criminality).\nMachiavelli makes an important distinction between two groups that are present in every city, and have very different appetites driving them: the \"great\" and the \"people\". The \"great\" wish to oppress and rule the \"people\", while the \"people\" wish not to be ruled or oppressed. A principality is not the only outcome possible from these appetites, because it can also lead to either \"liberty\" or \"license\".\nA principality is put into place either by the \"great\" or the \"people\" when they have the opportunity to take power, but find resistance from the other side. They assign a leader who can be popular to the people while the great benefit, or a strong authority defending the people against the great.\n\nMachiavelli goes on to say that a prince who obtains power through the support of the nobles has a harder time staying in power than someone who is chosen by the common people; since the former finds himself surrounded by people who consider themselves his equals. He has to resort to malevolent measures to satisfy the nobles. One cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress, while the former only desire not to be oppressed.Also, a prince cannot afford to keep the common people hostile as they are larger in number, while the nobles are smaller.\nTherefore, the great should be made and unmade every day. Two types of great people might be encountered:\n\nThose who are bound to the prince: Concerning these it is important to distinguish between two types of obligated great people, those who are rapacious and those who are not. It is the latter who can and should be honored.\nThose who are not bound to the new prince: Once again, these need to be divided into two types – those with a weak spirit (a prince can make use of them if they are of good counsel) and those who shun being bound because of their own ambition (these should be watched and feared as enemies).\nHow to win over people depends on circumstances: Machiavelli advises:\n\nDo not get frightened in adversity.\nOne should avoid ruling via magistrates, if one wishes to be able to \"ascend\" to absolute rule quickly and safely.\nOne should make sure that the people need the prince, especially if a time of need should come.\n\n\n=== How to judge the strength of principalities (Chapter 10) ===\nThe way to judge the strength of a princedom is to see whether it can defend itself, or whether it needs to depend on allies. This does not just mean that the cities should be prepared and the people trained; a prince who is hated is also exposed.\n\n\n=== Ecclesiastical principalities (Chapter 11) ===\n\nThis type of \"principality\" refers explicitly to the Catholic Church as an example, which is of course not traditionally thought of as a principality. According to Machiavelli, these are relatively easy to maintain, once founded. They do not need to defend themselves militarily, nor to govern their subjects. \nMachiavelli discusses the recent history of the Church as if it were a princedom that was in competition to conquer Italy against other princes. He points to factionalism as a historical weak point in the Church, and points to the recent example of the Borgia family as a better strategy which almost worked. He then explicitly proposes that the Medici are now in a position to try the same thing.\n\n\n=== Defense and military (Chapters 12–14) ===\nHaving discussed the various types of principalities, Machiavelli turns to the ways a state can attack other territories or defend itself. The two most essential foundations for any state, whether old or new, are sound laws and strong military forces.\nA self-sufficient prince is one who can meet any enemy on the battlefield. He should be \"armed\" with his own arms. However, a prince that relies solely on fortifications or on the help of others and stands on the defensive is not self-sufficient. If he cannot raise a formidable army, but must rely on defense, he must fortify his city. A well-fortified city is unlikely to be attacked, and if it is, most armies cannot endure an extended siege. However, during a siege a virtuous prince will keep the morale of his subjects high while removing all dissenters. Thus, as long as the city is properly defended and has enough supplies, a wise prince can withstand any siege.\nMachiavelli stands strongly against the use of mercenaries, and in this he was innovative, and he also had personal experience in Florence. He believes they are useless to a ruler because they are undisciplined, cowardly, and without any loyalty, being motivated only by money. Machiavelli attributes the Italian city states' weakness to their reliance on mercenary armies.\nMachiavelli also warns against using auxiliary forces, troops borrowed from an ally, because if they win, the employer is under their favor and if they lose, he is ruined. Auxiliary forces are more dangerous than mercenary forces because they are united and controlled by capable leaders who may turn against the employer.\nThe main concern for a prince should be war, or the preparation thereof, not books. Through war a hereditary prince maintains his power or a private citizen rises to power. Machiavelli advises that a prince must frequently hunt in order to keep his body fit and learn the landscape surrounding his kingdom. Through this, he can best learn how to protect his territory and advance upon others. For intellectual strength, he is advised to study great military men so he may imitate their successes and avoid their mistakes. A prince who is diligent in times of peace will be ready in times of adversity. Machiavelli writes, \"thus, when fortune turns against him he will be prepared to resist it.\"\n\n\n=== The Qualities of a Prince (Chapters 14–19) ===\nEach of the following chapters presents a discussion about a particular virtue or vice that a prince might have, and is therefore structured in a way which appears like traditional advice for a prince. However, the advice is far from traditional.\n\n\n==== A Prince's Duty Concerning Military Matters (Chapter 14) ====\nMachiavelli believes that a prince's main focus should be on perfecting the art of war. He believes that by taking this profession an aspiring prince will be able to acquire a state, and will be able to maintain what he has gained. He claims that \"being disarmed makes you despised.\" He believes that the only way to ensure loyalty from one's soldiers is to understand military matters.\nThe two activities Machiavelli recommends practicing to prepare for war are physical and mental. Physically, he believes rulers should learn the landscape of their territories. Mentally, he encouraged the study of past military events. He also warns against idleness.\n\n\n==== Reputation of a prince (Chapter 15) ====\nBecause, says Machiavelli, he wants to write something useful to those who understand, he thought it more fitting \"to go directly to the effectual truth (\"verità effettuale\") of the thing than to the imagination of it\". This section is one where Machiavelli's pragmatic ideal can be seen most clearly. Machiavelli reasons that since princes come across men who are evil, he should learn how to be equally evil himself, and use this ability or not according to necessity. Concerning the behavior of a prince toward his subjects, Machiavelli announces that he will depart from what other writers say, and writes: Men have imagined republics and principalities that never really existed at all. Yet the way men live is so far removed from the way they ought to live that anyone who abandons what is for what should be pursues his downfall rather than his preservation; for a man who strives after goodness in all his acts is sure to come to ruin, since there are so many men who are not good.\nSince there are many possible qualities that a prince can be said to possess, he must not be overly concerned about having all the good ones. Also, a prince may be perceived to be merciful, faithful, humane, frank, and religious, but most important is only to seem to have these qualities. A prince cannot truly have these qualities because at times it is necessary to act against them. Although a bad reputation should be avoided, it is sometimes necessary to have one. In fact, he must sometimes deliberately choose evil:  He who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation.\n\n\n==== Generosity vs. parsimony (Chapter 16) ====\nIf a prince is overly generous to his subjects, Machiavelli asserts he will not be appreciated, and will only cause greed for more. Additionally, being overly generous is not economical, because eventually all resources will be exhausted. This results in higher taxes, and will bring grief upon the prince. Then, if he decides to discontinue or limit his generosity, he will be labeled as a miser. Thus, Machiavelli summarizes that guarding against the people's hatred is more important than building up a reputation for generosity. A wise prince should be willing to be more reputed a miser than be hated for trying to be too generous.\nOn the other hand: \"of what is not yours or your subjects' one can be a bigger giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander, because spending what is someone else's does not take reputation from you but adds it to you; only spending your own hurts you\".\n\n\n==== Cruelty vs. mercy (Chapter 17) ====\n\nMachiavelli begins this chapter by addressing how mercy can be misused which will harm the prince and his dominion. He ends by stating that a prince should not shrink from being cruel if it means that it will keep his subjects in line. After all, it will help him maintain his rule. He gives the example of Cesare Borgia, whose cruelty protected him from rebellions. He compares this example with the leaders of Florence, who, through too much mercy, allowed the city of Pistoia to destroy itself.\nIn addressing the question of whether it is better to be loved or feared, Machiavelli writes, \"The answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other; but because it is difficult to combine them, it is far safer to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.\" As Machiavelli asserts, commitments made in peace are not always kept in adversity; however, commitments made in fear are kept out of fear. Yet, a prince must ensure that he is not feared to the point of hatred, which is very possible.\nThis chapter is possibly the most well-known of the work, and it is important because of the reasoning behind Machiavelli's famous idea that it is better to be feared than loved. His justification is purely pragmatic; as he notes, \"Men worry less about doing an injury to one who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared.\" Fear is used as a means to ensure obedience from his subjects, and security for the prince. Above all, Machiavelli argues, a prince should not interfere with the property of their subjects or their women, and if they should try to kill someone, they should do it with a convenient justification.\nRegarding the troops of the prince, fear is absolutely necessary to keep a large garrison united and a prince should not mind the thought of cruelty in that regard. For a prince who leads his own army, it is imperative for him to observe cruelty because that is the only way he can command his soldiers' absolute respect. Machiavelli compares two great military leaders: Hannibal and Scipio Africanus. Although Hannibal's army consisted of men of various races, they were never rebellious because they feared their leader. Machiavelli says this required \"inhuman cruelty\" which he refers to as a virtue. Scipio's men, on the other hand, were known for their mutiny and dissension, due to Scipio's \"excessive mercy\" – which was, however, a source of glory because he lived in a republic.\n\n\n==== In what way princes should keep their word (Chapter 18) ====\nMachiavelli notes that a prince is praised for keeping his word. However, he also notes that in reality, the most cunning princes succeed politically. A prince, therefore, should only keep his word when it suits his purposes, but do his utmost to maintain the illusion that he does keep his word and that he is reliable in that regard. Machiavelli advises the ruler to become a \"great liar and deceiver\", and that men are so easy to deceive, that the ruler won't have an issue with lying to others. He justifies this by saying that men are wicked, and never keep their words, therefore the ruler doesn't have to keep his.\nAs Machiavelli notes, \"He should appear to be compassionate, faithful to his word, guileless, and devout. And indeed he should be so. But his disposition should be such that, if he needs to be the opposite, he knows how.\" As noted in chapter 15, the prince must appear to be virtuous in order to hide his actions, and he should be able to be otherwise when the time calls for it; that includes being able to lie, though however much he lies he should always keep the appearance of being truthful.\nIn this chapter, Machiavelli uses \"beasts\" as a metaphor for unscrupulous behavior. He states that while lawful conduct is part of the nature of men, a prince should learn how to use the nature of both men and beasts wisely to ensure the stability of his regime. In this chapter however, his focus is solely on the \"beastly\" natures. In particular, he compares the use of force to the \"lion\", and the use of deception to the \"fox\", and advises the prince to study them both. In employing this metaphor, Machiavelli apparently references De Officiis by the Roman orator and statesman Cicero, and subverts its conclusion, arguing instead that dishonorable behavior is sometimes politically necessary.\n\n\n==== Avoiding contempt and hatred (Chapter 19) ====\nMachiavelli divides the fears which monarchs should have into internal (domestic) and external (foreign) fears. Internal fears exist inside his kingdom and focus on his subjects, Machiavelli warns to be suspicious of everyone when hostile attitudes emerge. Machiavelli observes that the majority of men are content as long as they are not deprived of their property and women, and only a minority of men are ambitious enough to be a concern. A prince should command respect through his conduct, because a prince who raises no contempt of the nobles and maintains the satisfaction of the people, Machiavelli assures, should have no fear of conspirators working with external powers. Conspiracy is very difficult and risky in such a situation.\nMachiavelli apparently seems to go back on his rule that a prince can evade hate, as he says that he will eventually be hated by someone, so he should seek to avoid being hated by the commonfolk.\nRoman emperors, on the other hand, had not only the majority and an ambitious minority, but also a cruel and greedy military, who created extra problems as they demanded iniquity. While a prince should avoid being hated, he will eventually be hated by someone, so he must at least avoid the hatred of the most powerful, and for the Roman emperors this included the military who demanded iniquity against the people out of their own greed. He uses Septimius Severus as a model for new rulers to emulate, as he \"embodied both the fox and the lion\". Severus outwitted and killed his military rivals, and although he oppressed the people, Machiavelli says that he kept the common people \"satisfied and stupified\".\nMachiavelli notes that in his time only the Turkish empire had the problem of the Romans, because in other lands the people had become more powerful than the military.\n\n\n=== The Prudence of the Prince (Chapters 20–25) ===\n\n\n==== Whether ruling conquests with fortresses works (Chapter 20) ====\nMachiavelli mentions that placing fortresses in conquered territories, although it sometimes works, often fails. Using fortresses can be a good plan, but Machiavelli says he shall \"blame anyone who, trusting in fortresses, thinks little of being hated by the people\". He cited Caterina Sforza, who used a fortress to defend herself but was eventually betrayed by her people.\n\n\n==== Gaining honors (Chapter 21) ====\nA prince truly earns honor by completing great feats. King Ferdinand of Spain is cited by Machiavelli as an example of a monarch who gained esteem by showing his ability through great feats and who, in the name of religion, conquered many territories and kept his subjects occupied so that they had no chance to rebel.\nRegarding two warring states, Machiavelli asserts it is always wiser to choose a side, rather than to be neutral. Machiavelli then provides the following reasons why:\n\nIf your allies win, you benefit whether or not you have more power than they have.\nIf you are more powerful, then your allies are under your command; if your allies are stronger, they will always feel a certain obligation to you for your help.\nIf your side loses, you still have an ally in the loser.\nMachiavelli also notes that it is wise for a prince not to ally with a stronger force unless compelled to do so. In conclusion, the most important virtue is having the wisdom to discern what ventures will come with the most reward and then pursuing them courageously.\n\n\n==== Nobles and staff (Chapter 22) ====\nThe selection of good servants is reflected directly upon the prince's intelligence, so if they are loyal, the prince is considered wise; however, when they are otherwise, the prince is open to adverse criticism. Machiavelli asserts that there are three types of intelligence:\n\nThe kind that understands things for itself – which is excellent to have.\nThe kind that understands what others can understand – which is good to have.\nThe kind that does not understand for itself, nor through others – which is useless to have.\nIf the prince does not have the first type of intelligence, he should at the very least have the second type. For, as Machiavelli states, \"A prince needs to have the discernment to recognize the good or bad in what another says or does even though he has no acumen himself\".\n\n\n==== Avoiding flatterers (Chapter 23) ====\nThis chapter displays a low opinion of flatterers; Machiavelli notes that \"Men are so happily absorbed in their own affairs and indulge in such self-deception that it is difficult for them not to fall victim to this plague; and some efforts to protect oneself from flatterers involve the risk of becoming despised.\"  Flatterers were seen as a great danger to a prince, because their flattery could cause him to avoid wise counsel in favor of rash action, but avoiding all advice, flattery or otherwise, was equally bad; a middle road had to be taken. A prudent prince should have a select group of wise counselors to advise him truthfully on matters all the time. All their opinions should be taken into account. Ultimately, the decision should be made by the prince and carried out absolutely. If a prince is given to changing his mind, his reputation will suffer. A prince must have the wisdom to recognize good advice from bad. Machiavelli gives a negative example in Emperor Maximilian I; Maximilian, who was secretive, never consulted others, but once he ordered his plans and met dissent, he immediately changed them.\n\n\n=== Prudence and chance ===\n\n\n==== Why the princes of Italy lost their states (Chapter 24) ====\nAfter first mentioning that a new prince can quickly become as respected as a hereditary one, Machiavelli says princes in Italy who had longstanding power and lost it cannot blame bad luck, but should blame their own indolence. One \"should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up\". They all showed a defect of arms (already discussed) and either had a hostile populace or did not know to secure themselves against the great.\n\n\n==== How Much Fortune Can Do in Human Affairs, and in What Mode It May Be Opposed (Chapter 25) ====\nAs pointed out by Gilbert (1938:206) it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but \"Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work\". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with \"sweat\", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances.\nMachiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that \"it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down.\" Gilbert (p. 217) points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune.\nMachiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As de Alvarez (1999:125–30) points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to \"fortune and God\". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers uncontrolled.\n\n\n==== Exhortation to Seize Italy and to Free Her from the Barbarians (Chapter 26) ====\nPope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book. Gilbert (1938:222–30) showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed, one example is the Borgia family's \"recent\" and controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often brutally executed. This continues a controversial theme throughout the book.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\nAs shown by his letter of dedication, Machiavelli's work eventually came to be dedicated to Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici, grandson of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and a member of the ruling Florentine Medici family, whose uncle Giovanni became Pope Leo X in 1513. It is known from his personal correspondence that it was written during 1513, the year after the Medici regained control of Florence, and a few months after Machiavelli's arrest, torture, and banishment by the in-coming Medici regime. It was discussed for a long time with Francesco Vettori – a friend of Machiavelli – whom he wanted to pass it and commend it to the Medici. The book had originally been intended for Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici, young Lorenzo's uncle, who however died in 1516. It is not certain that the work was ever read by any of the Medici before it was printed. Machiavelli describes the contents as being an un-embellished summary of his knowledge about the nature of princes and \"the actions of great men\", based not only on reading but also, unusually, on real experience.\nThe types of political behavior that are discussed with apparent approval by Machiavelli in The Prince were regarded as shocking by contemporaries, and its immorality is still a subject of serious discussion. Although the work advises princes how to tyrannize, Machiavelli is generally thought to have preferred some form of republican government. Some commentators justify his acceptance of immoral and criminal actions by leaders by arguing that he lived during a time of continuous political conflict and instability in Italy, and that his influence has increased the \"pleasures, equality and freedom\" of many people, loosening the grip of medieval Catholicism's \"classical teleology\", which \"disregarded not only the needs of individuals and the wants of the common man, but stifled innovation, enterprise, and enquiry into cause and effect relationships that now allow us to control nature\".\nOn the other hand, Strauss (1958:11) notes that \"even if we were forced to grant that Machiavelli was essentially a patriot or a scientist, we would not be forced to deny that he was a teacher of evil\". Furthermore, Machiavelli \"was too thoughtful not to know what he was doing and too generous not to admit it to his reasonable friends\".\nMachiavelli emphasized the need for looking at the \"effectual truth\" (verita effetuale), as opposed to relying on \"imagined republics and principalities\". He states the difference between honorable behavior and criminal behavior by using the metaphor of animals, saying that \"there are two ways of contending, one in accordance with the laws, the other by force; the first of which is proper to men, the second to beast\".  In The Prince he does not explain what he thinks the best ethical or political goals are, except the control of one's own fortune, as opposed to waiting to see what chance brings. Machiavelli took it for granted that would-be leaders naturally aim at glory or honor. He associated these goals with a need for \"virtue\" and \"prudence\" in a leader, and saw such virtues as essential to good politics. That great men should develop and use their virtue and prudence was a traditional theme of advice to Christian princes. And that more virtue meant less reliance on chance was a classically influenced \"humanist commonplace\" in Machiavelli's time, as Fischer (2000:75) says, even if it was somewhat controversial. However, Machiavelli went far beyond other authors in his time, who in his opinion left things to fortune, and therefore to bad rulers, because of their Christian beliefs. He used the words \"virtue\" and \"prudence\" to refer to glory-seeking and spirited excellence of character, in strong contrast to the traditional Christian uses of those terms, but more keeping with the original pre-Christian Greek and Roman concepts from which they derived. He encouraged ambition and risk taking. So in another break with tradition, he treated not only stability, but also radical innovation, as possible aims of a prince in a political community. Managing major reforms can show off a Prince's virtue and give him glory. He clearly felt Italy needed major reform in his time, and this opinion of his time is widely shared.\nMachiavelli's descriptions encourage leaders to attempt to control their fortune gloriously, to the extreme extent that some situations may call for a fresh \"founding\" (or re-founding) of the \"modes and orders\" that define a community, despite the danger and necessary evil and lawlessness of such a project. Founding a wholly new state, or even a new religion, using injustice and immorality has even been called the chief theme of The Prince. Machiavelli justifies this position by explaining how if \"a prince did not win love he may escape hate\" by personifying injustice and immorality; therefore, he will never loosen his grip since \"fear is held by the apprehension of punishment\" and never diminishes as time goes by. For a political theorist to do this in public was one of Machiavelli's clearest breaks not just with medieval scholasticism, but with the classical tradition of political philosophy, especially the favorite philosopher of Catholicism at the time, Aristotle. This is one of Machiavelli's most lasting influences upon modernity.\nNevertheless, Machiavelli was heavily influenced by classical pre-Christian political philosophy. According to Strauss (1958:291) Machiavelli refers to Xenophon more than Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero put together. Xenophon wrote one of the classic mirrors of princes, the Education of Cyrus. Gilbert (1938:236) wrote: \"The Cyrus of Xenophon was a hero to many a literary man of the sixteenth century, but for Machiavelli he lived\". Xenophon also, as Strauss pointed out, wrote a dialogue, Hiero which showed a wise man dealing sympathetically with a tyrant, coming close to what Machiavelli would do in uprooting the ideal of \"the imagined prince\". Xenophon however, like Plato and Aristotle, was a follower of Socrates, and his works show approval of a \"teleological argument\", while Machiavelli rejected such arguments. On this matter, Strauss (1958:222–23) gives evidence that Machiavelli may have seen himself as having learned something from Democritus, Epicurus and classical materialism, which was however not associated with political realism, or even any interest in politics.\nOn the topic of rhetoric, Machiavelli, in his introduction, stated that \"I have not embellished or crammed this book with rounded periods or big, impressive words, or with any blandishment or superfluous decoration of the kind which many are in the habit of using to describe or adorn what they have produced\". This has been interpreted as showing a distancing from traditional rhetoric styles, but there are echoes of classical rhetoric in several areas.  In Chapter 18, for example, he uses a metaphor of a lion and a fox, examples of force and cunning; according to Zerba (2004:217), \"the Roman author from whom Machiavelli in all likelihood drew the simile of the lion and the fox\" was Cicero. The Rhetorica ad Herennium, a work which was believed during Machiavelli's time to have been written by Cicero, was used widely to teach rhetoric, and it is likely that Machiavelli was familiar with it. Unlike Cicero's more widely accepted works however, according to Cox (1997:1122), \"Ad Herennium ... offers a model of an ethical system that not only condones the practice of force and deception but appears to regard them as habitual and indeed germane to political activity\". This makes it an ideal text for Machiavelli to have used.\nThe Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci argued that Machiavelli's audience for this work was not the classes who already rule (or have \"hegemony\") over the common people, but the common people themselves, trying to establish a new hegemony, and making Machiavelli the first \"Italian Jacobin\".\n\n\n== Influence ==\nTo quote Bireley (1990:14):\n\n...there were in circulation approximately fifteen editions of the Prince and nineteen of the Discourses and French translations of each before they were placed on the Index of Paul IV in 1559, a measure which nearly stopped publication in Catholic areas except in France. Three principal writers took the field against Machiavelli between the publication of his works and their condemnation in 1559 and again by the Tridentine Index in 1564. These were the English cardinal Reginald Pole and the Portuguese bishop Jerónimo Osório, both of whom lived for many years in Italy, and the Italian humanist and later bishop, Ambrogio Caterino Politi.\n\nMachiavelli's ideas on how to accrue honor and power as a leader had a profound impact on political leaders throughout the modern West, helped by the new technology of the printing press. Pole reported that it was spoken of highly by his enemy Thomas Cromwell in England, and had influenced Henry VIII in his turn towards Protestantism, and in his tactics, for example during the Pilgrimage of Grace. A copy was also possessed by the Catholic king and emperor Charles V. In France, after an initially mixed reaction, Machiavelli came to be associated with Catherine de Medici and the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre. As Bireley (1990:17) reports, in the 16th century, Catholic writers \"associated Machiavelli with the Protestants, whereas Protestant authors saw him as Italian and Catholic\". In fact, he was apparently influencing both Catholic and Protestant kings.\nOne of the most important early works dedicated to criticism of Machiavelli, especially The Prince, was that of the Huguenot, Innocent Gentillet, Discourse against Machiavelli, commonly also referred to as Anti Machiavel, published in Geneva in 1576. He accused Machiavelli of being an atheist and accused politicians of his time by saying that they treated his works as the \"Koran of the courtiers\". Another theme of Gentillet was more in the spirit of Machiavelli himself: he questioned the effectiveness of immoral strategies (just as Machiavelli had himself done, despite also explaining how they could sometimes work). This became the theme of much future political discourse in Europe during the 17th century. This includes the Catholic Counter Reformation writers summarised by Bireley: Giovanni Botero, Justus Lipsius, Carlo Scribani, Adam Contzen, Pedro de Ribadeneira, and Diego de Saavedra Fajardo. These authors criticized Machiavelli, but also followed him in many ways. They accepted the need for a prince to be concerned with reputation, and even a need for cunning and deceit, but compared to Machiavelli, and like later modernist writers, they emphasized economic progress much more than the riskier ventures of war. These authors tended to cite Tacitus as their source for realist political advice, rather than Machiavelli, and this pretense came to be known as \"Tacitism\". Cardinal Reginald Pole read Il Principe while he was in Italy, and on which he commented: \"I found this type of book to be written by an enemy of the human race. It explains every means whereby religion, justice and any inclination toward virtue could be destroyed\".\nModern materialist philosophy developed in the 16th, 17th and 18th century, starting in the generations after Machiavelli. The importance of Machiavelli's realism was noted by many important figures in this endeavor, for example Jean Bodin, Francis Bacon, Harrington, John Milton, Spinoza, Rousseau, Hume, Edward Gibbon, and Adam Smith. Although he was not always mentioned by name as an inspiration, due to his controversy, he is also thought to have been an influence for other major philosophers, such as Montaigne, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke and Montesquieu. Due to the fame (or infamy) of his works, Machiavelli soon became a figure in the popular culture of the English stage. Machiavelli is featured as a character in the prologue of Christopher Marlowe's The Jew of Malta, and in William Shakespeare's tragic plays, such as Othello, Macbeth, and Richard III, feature characters whom are an example of the stage Machiavel, a type of character whom advances themselves politically via devious means. \nThe republicanism in seventeenth-century England which led to the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution and subsequent development of the English Constitution was strongly influenced by Machiavelli's political thought. Most of the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution are known or often proposed to have been strongly influenced by Machiavelli's political works, including Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton and John Adams. Also, under the guidance of Voltaire, Frederick the Great of Prussia criticised Machiavelli's conclusions in his \"Anti-Machiavel\", published in 1740. At different stages in his life, Napoleon I of France wrote extensive comments to The Prince. After his defeat at Waterloo, these comments were found in the emperor's coach and taken by the Prussian military. 20th century leaders also were influenced by Machiavelli. For example, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini wrote a discourse on The Prince. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin read The Prince and annotated his own copy.\n\n\n== Interpretations ==\n\n\n=== Timeline of composition ===\nThere has been much debate of when Machiavelli actually composed The Prince (and his other works). Commentators have viewed this question to be of great importance, as some interpreters believe that Machiavelli changed his views between the composition of The Prince, and the composition of The Discourses. Hans Baron is one of such commentators who argued that Machiavelli must have changed his mind dramatically in favor of free republics, after having written The Prince. Harvey Mansfield and Nathan Tarcov, in the introduction to their translation of The Discourses on Livy, state that there are no discrepancies between The Prince and his later works, and that it \"seems the safest\" to see them \"as a pair of works, not much different, if at all, in time of composition.\" Scholar William Connell views that the composition and development of The Prince was a lengthy process with his ideas being revised from 1513 to 1515.\n\n\n=== Other interpretations ===\nSatire\nThis interpretation was famously put forth by scholar Garrett Mattingly (1958), who stated that \"In some ways, Machiavelli's little treatise was just like all the other 'Mirrors of Princes', in other ways it was a diabolical burlesque of all of them, like a political Black Mass.\"\n\nThis position was taken up previously by some of the more prominent Enlightenment philosophes. Diderot speculated that it was a work designed not to mock, but to secretly expose corrupt princely rule. And in his The Social Contract, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau said: Machiavelli was a proper man and a good citizen; but, being attached to the court of the Medici, he could not help veiling his love of liberty in the midst of his country's oppression. The choice of his detestable hero, Cesare Borgia, clearly enough shows his hidden aim; and the contradiction between the teaching of the Prince and that of the Discourses on Livy and the History of Florence shows that this profound political thinker has so far been studied only by superficial or corrupt readers. The Court of Rome sternly prohibited his book. I can well believe it; for it is that Court it most clearly portrays.\nHowever, this line of interpretation is often refuted by those who study Machiavelli's works. For example Isaiah Berlin states that he cannot find anything other than Machiavelli's work that \"reads less\" like a satirical piece. Maurizio Viroli writes: \"In my opinion, none of these defenses of Machiavelli is valid. The view that The Prince is the \"book of Republicans\" comes from Rousseau's desire to rescue its author's bad reputation and make The Prince consistent with the Discourses on Livy, the text in which Machiavelli developed a comprehensive republican theory of liberty and government\" and added that the claim \"misrepresents the meaning of the text.\"\nDeceit\nMary Dietz, in her essay \"Trapping The Prince\", writes that Machiavelli's agenda was not to be satirical, as Rousseau had argued, but instead was \"offering carefully crafted advice (such as arming the people) designed to undo the ruler if taken seriously and followed.\" By this account, the aim was to reestablish the republic in Florence. She focuses on three categories in which Machiavelli gives paradoxical advice:\n\nHe discourages liberality and favors deceit to guarantee support from the people. Yet Machiavelli is keenly aware of the fact that an earlier pro-republican coup had been thwarted by the people's inaction that itself stemmed from the prince's liberality.\nHe supports arming the people despite the fact that he knows the Florentines are decidedly pro-democratic and would oppose the prince.\nHe encourages the prince to live in the city he conquers. This opposes the Medici's habitual policy of living outside the city. It also makes it easier for rebels or a civilian militia to attack and overthrow the prince.\nAccording to Dietz, the trap never succeeded because Lorenzo – \"a suspicious prince\" – apparently never read the work of the \"former republican.\"\n\n\n== Translations ==\nMachiavelli, Niccolò (1908), \"The Prince\", Translated by W.K.

The work moves into the realm \"beyond good and evil\" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.\nThe book is well-known for the often-quoted line: \"He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.\" \n\n\n== Background and themes ==\nOf the four \"late-period\" writings of Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil most closely resembles the aphoristic style of his middle period. In it he exposes the deficiencies of those usually called \"philosophers\" and identifies the qualities of the \"new philosophers\": imagination, self-assertion, danger, originality, and the \"creation of values\". He then contests some of the key presuppositions of the old philosophic tradition like \"self-consciousness\", \"knowledge\", \"truth\", and \"free will\", explaining them as inventions of the moral consciousness. In their place, he offers the \"will to power\" as an explanation of all behavior; this ties into his \"perspective of life\", which he regards as \"beyond good and evil\", denying a universal morality for all human beings. Religion and the master and slave moralities feature prominently as Nietzsche re-evaluates deeply held humanistic beliefs, portraying even domination, appropriation and injury to the weak as not universally objectionable.\nIn several places of the book, Nietzsche drops hints, and even explicit statements as to what the philosophies of the future must deal with.\n\n\n== Structure of the work ==\nThe work consists of a short preface dated to 1885, 296 numbered sections, and an \"epode\" (or \"aftersong\") entitled \"From High Mountains\". Not counting the preface or epode, the main sections are organized into nine parts:\n\nPart One: On the Prejudices of Philosophers\nPart Two: The Free Spirit\nPart Three: The Religious Mood\nPart Four: Apophthegms and Interludes\nPart Five: The Natural History of Morals\nPart Six: We Scholars\nPart Seven: Our Virtues\nPart Eight: Peoples and Countries\nPart Nine: What is Noble?\n\n\n== On philosophers, free spirits, and scholars ==\nIn the opening two parts of the book, Nietzsche discusses, in turn, the philosophers of the past, whom he accuses of a blind dogmatism plagued by moral prejudice masquerading as a search for objective truth; and the \"free spirits\", like himself, who are to replace them.\nHe casts doubt on the project of past philosophy by asking why we should want the \"truth\" rather than recognizing untruth \"as a condition of life.\" He offers an entirely psychological explanation of every past philosophy: each has been an \"involuntary and unconscious memoir\" on the part of its author (§ 6) and exists to justify his moral prejudices, which he solemnly baptizes as \"truths\".\nIn one passage (§ 34), Nietzsche writes that \"from every point of view the erroneousness of the world in which we believe we live is the surest and firmest thing we can get our eyes on.\" Philosophers are wrong to rail violently against the risk of being deceived. \"It is no more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than appearance.\" Life is nothing without appearances; it appears to Nietzsche that it follows from this that the abolition of appearances would imply the abolition of \"truth\" as well. Nietzsche asks the question, \"what compels us to assume there exists any essential antithesis between 'true' and 'false'?\"\nNietzsche singles out the Stoic precept of \"living according to nature\" (§ 9) as showing how philosophy \"creates the world in its own image\" by trying to regiment nature \"according to the Stoa.\" But nature, as something uncontrollable and \"prodigal beyond measure,\" cannot be tyrannized over in the way Stoics tyrannize over themselves. Further, there are forceful attacks on several individual philosophers. Descartes' cogito presupposes that there is an I, that there is such an activity as thinking, and that I know what thinking is (§ 16). Spinoza masks his \"personal timidity and vulnerability\" by hiding behind his geometrical method (§ 5), and inconsistently makes self-preservation a fundamental drive while rejecting teleology (§ 13). Kant, \"the great Chinaman of Königsberg\" (§ 210), reverts to the prejudice of an old moralist with his categorical imperative, the dialectical grounding of which is a mere smokescreen (§ 5). His \"faculty\" to explain the possibility of synthetic a priori judgements is pejoratively compared to a passage from Molière's comedy Le Malade imaginaire in which the narcotic quality of opium is described in terms of a \"sleepy faculty\" – according to Nietzsche, both Kant's explanation of synthetic a priori judgments and Moliére's comedic description of opium are examples of redundant self-referring statements which do not explain anything. Schopenhauer is mistaken in thinking that the nature of the will is self-evident  (§ 19), which is, in fact, a highly complex instrument of control over those who must obey, not transparent to those who command.\n\"Free spirits\", by contrast to the philosophers of the past, are \"investigators to the point of cruelty, with rash fingers for the ungraspable, with teeth and stomach for the most indigestible\" (§ 44). Nietzsche warns against those who would suffer for the sake of truth and exhorts his readers to shun these indignant sufferers for truth and lend their ears instead to \"cynics\"—those who \"speak 'badly' of man—but do not speak ill of him\" (§ 26).\nThere are kinds of fearless scholars who are truly independent of prejudice (§ 6), but these \"philosophical labourers and men of science in general\" should not be confused with philosophers, who are \"commanders and law-givers\" (§ 211).\nNietzsche also subjects physics to critique. \"Nature's conformity to law\" is merely one interpretation of the phenomena which natural science observes; Nietzsche suggests that the same phenomena could equally be interpreted as demonstrating \"the tyrannically ruthless and inexorable enforcement of power-demands\" (§ 22). Nietzsche appears to espouse a strong brand of scientific anti-realism when he asserts that \"It is we alone who have fabricated causes, succession, reciprocity, relativity, compulsion, number, law, freedom, motive, purpose\" (§ 21).\n\n\n== On morality and religion ==\nIn the \"pre-moral\" period of mankind, actions were judged by their consequences. Over the past 10,000 years, however, a morality has developed where actions are judged by their origins (their motivations) not their consequences. This morality of intentions is, according to Nietzsche, a \"prejudice\" and \"something provisional [...] that must be overcome\" (§ 32).\nNietzsche criticizes \"unegoistic morality\" and demands that \"Moralities must first of all be forced to bow before order of rank\" (§ 221). Every \"high culture\" begins by recognizing \"the pathos of distance\" (§ 257).\nNietzsche contrasts southern (Catholic) and northern (Protestant) Christianity; northern Europeans have much less \"talent for religion\" (§ 48) and lack \"southern delicatezza\" (§ 50). As elsewhere, Nietzsche praises the Old Testament while disparaging the New Testament (§ 52).\nReligion has always been connected to \"three dangerous dietary prescriptions: solitude, fasting and sexual abstinence\" (§ 47), and has exerted cruelty through demanding sacrifice according to a \"ladder\" with different rungs of cruelty, which has ultimately caused God himself to be sacrificed (§ 55). Christianity, \"the most fatal kind of self-presumption ever\", has beaten everything joyful, assertive and autocratic out of man and turned him into a \"sublime abortion\" (§ 62). If, unlike past philosophers such as Schopenhauer, we really want to tackle the problems of morality, we must \"compare many moralities\" and \"prepare a typology of morals\" (§ 186). In a discussion that anticipates On the Genealogy of Morality, Nietzsche claims that \"Morality is in Europe today herd-animal morality\" (§ 202)—i.e., it emanates from the ressentiment of the slave for the master (see also § 260, which leads into the discussion in Genealogy, I).\nNietzsche argues that more than what they value as \"good\" distinguishes noble and base. Even where agreement exists over what is good, what men consider a sufficient sign of possessing what is good differs (§ 194). Nietzsche describes love as the desire to possess a woman. The most unrefined form of the desire is also the most readily identifiable as a desire to possess another: control over the woman's body. A subtler desire to possess her also wants her soul, and thus wants her to be willing to sacrifice herself for her lover. Nietzsche describes this as a more complete possession. A still more refined desire to possess her prompts a concern that she might be willing to sacrifice what she desires for a mistaken image of her lover. This leads some lovers to want their women to know them deep down so that their sacrifice really is a sacrifice for them. A similar rank-ordering applies to statesmen, the less refined not caring whether they attain power by fraud, the more refined not taking pleasure in the people's love unless they love the statesman for who he really is. In both cases, the more spiritualized form of the desire to possess also demands one possess what is good more completely.\nIn § 259, Nietzsche states that to not injure, exploit or be violent to others as a general principle of society is \"a Will to the denial of life, a principle of dissolution and decay.\" He goes on to argue that life is \"essentially appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak.\"\n\n\n== On nations, peoples and cultures ==\nNietzsche discusses the complexities of the German soul (§ 244), praises the Jews and heavily criticizes the trend of German antisemitism (§ 251). He praises France as \"the seat of Europe's most spiritual and refined culture and the leading school of taste\" (§ 254). He finds the English coarse, gloomy, more brutal than the Germans, and declares that \"they are no philosophical race\", singling out Bacon, Hobbes, Hume and Locke as representing a \"debasement and devaluation of the concept 'philosopher' for more than a century\" (§ 252). Nietzsche also touches on problems of translation and the leaden quality of the German language (§ 28).\nIn a prophetic statement, Nietzsche proclaims that \"The time for petty politics is past: the very next century will bring with it the struggle for mastery over the whole earth\" (§ 208).\n\n\n== Aphorisms and poetry ==\nBetween § 62 and § 186 Nietzsche inserts a collection of mostly single-sentence aphorisms, modelled on French aphorists such as La Rochefoucauld. Twelve of these (§§ 84, 85, 86, 114, 115, 127, 131, 139, 144, 145, 147, 148) concern women or the distinction between men and women. Other subjects touched on include his doctrine of the eternal recurrence (§ 70), music (§ 106) and utilitarianism (§ 174), among more general attempts at trenchant observations about human nature.\nThe work concludes with a short ode to friendship in verse form (continuing Nietzsche's use of poetry in The Gay Science and Thus Spoke Zarathustra).\n\n\n== Editions ==\nJenseits von Gut und Böse.

By the time he was a teenager, he had been writing music and poetry. His aunt Rosalie gave him a biography of Alexander von Humboldt for his 15th birthday, and reading this inspired a love of learning \"for its own sake\". The schools he attended, the books he read, and his general milieu fostered and inculcated his interests in Bildung, a concept at least tangential to many in Zarathustra, and he worked extremely hard. He became an outstanding philologist almost accidentally, and he renounced his ideas about being an artist. As a philologist he became particularly sensitive to the transmissions and modifications of ideas, which also bears relevance into Zarathustra. Nietzsche's growing distaste toward philology, however, was yoked with his growing taste toward philosophy. As a student, this yoke was his work with Diogenes Laertius. Even with that work he strongly opposed received opinion. With subsequent and properly philosophical work he continued to oppose received opinion. His books leading up to Zarathustra have been described as nihilistic destruction. Such nihilistic destruction combined with his increasing isolation and the rejection of his marriage proposals (to Lou Andreas-Salomé) devastated him. While he was working on Thus Spoke Zarathustra he was walking very much. The imagery of his walks mingled with his physical and emotional and intellectual pains and his prior decades of hard work. What \"erupted\" was Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\nNietzsche has said that the central idea of Thus Spoke Zarathustra is the eternal recurrence. He has also said that this central idea first occurred to him in August 1881: he was near a \"pyramidal block of stone\" while walking through the woods along the shores of Lake Silvaplana in the Upper Engadine, and he made a small note that read \"6,000 feet beyond man and time\".\nA few weeks after meeting this idea, he paraphrased in a notebook something written by Friedrich von Hellwald about Zarathustra. This paraphrase was developed into the beginning of Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\nA year and a half after making that paraphrase, Nietzsche was living in Rapallo. Nietzsche claimed that the entire first part was conceived, and that Zarathustra himself \"came over him\", while walking. He was regularly walking \"the magnificent road to Zoagli\" and \"the whole Bay of Santa Margherita\". He said in a letter that the entire first part \"was conceived in the course of strenuous hiking: absolute certainty, as if every sentence were being called out to me\".\nNietzsche returned to \"the sacred place\" in the summer of 1883 and he \"found\" the second part.\nNietzsche was in Nice the following winter and he \"found\" the third part.\nAccording to Nietzsche in Ecce Homo it was \"scarcely one year for the entire work\", and ten days each part. More broadly, however, he said in a letter: \"The whole of Zarathustra is an explosion of forces that have been accumulating for decades\".\nIn January 1884, Nietzsche finished the third part and thought the book finished. But by November he expected a fourth part to be finished by January. He also mentioned a fifth and sixth part leading to Zarathustra's death, \"or else he will give me no peace\". But after the fourth part was finished he called it \"a fourth (and last) part of Zarathustra, a kind of sublime finale, which is not at all meant for the public\".\nThe first three parts were initially published individually and were first published together in a single volume in 1887. The fourth part was written in 1885. While Nietzsche retained mental capacity and was involved in the publication of his works, forty copies of the fourth part were printed at his own expense and distributed to his closest friends, to whom he expressed \"a vehement desire never to have the Fourth Part made public\". In 1889, however, Nietzsche became significantly incapacitated. In March 1892 part four was published separately, and the following July the four parts were published in a single volume.\n\n\n== Character of Zarathustra ==\nIn the 1888 Ecce Homo, Nietzsche explains what he meant by making the Persian figure of Zoroaster the protagonist of his book:\n\nPeople have never asked me as they should have done, what the name of Zarathustra precisely meant in my mouth, in the mouth of the first immoralist; for that which distinguishes this Persian from all others in the past is the very fact that he was the exact reverse of an immoralist. Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things. The translation of morality into the realm of metaphysics, as force, cause, end-in-itself, is his work. But the very question suggests its own answer. Zarathustra created this most portentous of all errors,—morality; therefore he must be the first to expose it. Not only because he has had longer and greater experience of the subject than any other thinker,—all history is indeed the experimental refutation of the theory of the so-called moral order of things,—but because of the more important fact that Zarathustra was the most truthful of thinkers. In his teaching alone is truthfulness upheld as the highest virtue—that is to say, as the reverse of the cowardice of the \"idealist\" who takes to his heels at the sight of reality. Zarathustra has more pluck in his body than all other thinkers put together. To tell the truth and to aim straight: that is the first Persian virtue. Have I made myself clear? ... The overcoming of morality by itself, through truthfulness, the moralist's overcoming of himself in his opposite—in me—that is what the name Zarathustra means in my mouth.Thus, \"[a]s Nietzsche admits himself, by choosing the name of Zarathustra as the prophet of his philosophy in a poetical idiom, he wanted to pay homage to the original Aryan prophet as a prominent founding figure of the spiritual-moral phase in human history, and reverse his teachings at the same time, according to his fundamental critical views on morality. The original Zoroastrian world-view interpreted being on the basis of the universality of the moral values and saw the whole world as an arena of the struggle between two fundamental moral elements, Good and Evil, depicted in two antagonistic divine figures [Ahura Mazda and Ahriman]. Nietzsche’s Zarathustra, in contrast, puts forward his ontological immoralism and tries to prove and reestablish the primordial innocence of beings by destroying philosophically all moralistic interpretations and evaluations of being\".\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n=== First part ===\nThe book begins with a prologue that sets up many of the themes that will be explored throughout the work. Zarathustra is introduced as a hermit who has lived ten years on a mountain with his two companions, an eagle and a serpent. One morning – inspired by the sun, which is happy only when it shines upon others – Zarathustra decides to return to the world and share his wisdom. Upon descending the mountain, he encounters a saint living in a forest, who spends his days praising God. Zarathustra marvels that the saint has not yet heard that \"God is dead\".\nArriving at the nearest town, Zarathustra addresses a crowd which has gathered to watch a tightrope walker. He tells them that mankind's goal must be to create something superior to itself – a new type of human, the Übermensch. All men, he says, must be prepared to will their own destruction in order to bring the Übermensch into being. The crowd greets this speech with scorn and mockery, and meanwhile the tightrope show begins. When the rope-dancer is halfway across, a clown comes up behind him, urging him to get out of the way. The clown then leaps over the rope-dancer, causing the latter to fall to his death. The crowd scatters; Zarathustra takes the corpse of the rope-dancer on his shoulders, carries it into the forest, and lays it in a hollow tree. He decides that from this point on, he will no longer attempt to speak to the masses, but only to a few chosen disciples.\nThere follows a series of discourses in which Zarathustra overturns many of the precepts of Christian morality. He gathers a group of disciples, but ultimately abandons them, saying that he will not return until they have disowned him.\n\n\n=== Second part ===\nZarathustra retires to his mountain cave, and several years pass by. One night, he dreams that he looks into a mirror and sees the face of a devil instead of his own; he takes this as a sign that his doctrines are being distorted by his enemies, and joyfully descends the mountain to recover his lost disciples.\nMore discourses follow, which continue to develop the themes of the death of God and the rise of the Übermensch, and also introduce the concept of the will to power. There are hints, however, that Zarathustra is holding something back. A series of dreams and visions prompt him to reveal this secret teaching, but he cannot bring himself to do so. He withdraws from his disciples once more, in order to perfect himself.\n\n\n=== Third part ===\nWhile journeying home, Zarathustra is waylaid by the spirit of gravity, a dwarf-like creature which clings to his back and whispers taunts into his ear. Zarathustra at first becomes despondent, but then takes courage; he challenges the spirit to hear the \"abysmal thought\" which he has so far refrained from speaking. This is the doctrine of eternal recurrence. Time, says Zarathustra, is infinite, stretching both forward and backward into eternity. This means that everything that happens now must have happened before, and that every moment must continue to repeat itself eternally.\nAs he speaks, Zarathustra hears a dog howl in terror, and then he sees a new vision – a shepherd choking on a black serpent which has crept into his throat. At Zarathustra's urging, the shepherd bites the serpent's head off and spits it out. In that moment, the shepherd is transformed into a laughing, radiant being, something greater than human.\nZarathustra continues his journey, delivering more discourses inspired by his observations. Arriving at his mountain cave, he remains there for some time, reflecting on his mission. He is disgusted at humanity's pettiness, and despairs at the thought of the eternal recurrence of such an insignificant race. Eventually, however, he discovers his own longing for eternity, and sings a song in celebration of eternal return.\n\n\n=== Fourth part ===\nZarathustra begins to grow old as he remains secluded in his cave. One day, he is visited by a soothsayer, who says that he has come to tempt Zarathustra to his final sin – compassion (mitleiden, which can also be translated as \"pity\"). A loud cry of distress is heard, and the soothsayer tells Zarathustra that \"the higher man\" is calling to him. Zarathustra is alarmed, and rushes to the aid of the higher man.\nSearching through his domain for the person who uttered the cry for help, Zarathustra encounters a series of characters representative of various aspects of humanity. He engages each of them in conversation, and ends by inviting each one to await his return in his cave. After a day's search, however, he is unable to find the higher man. Returning home, he hears the cry of distress once more, now coming from inside his own cave. He realises that all the people he has spoken to that day are collectively the higher man. Welcoming them to his home, he nevertheless tells them that they are not the men he has been waiting for; they are only the precursors of the Übermensch.\nZarathustra hosts a supper for his guests, which is enlivened by songs and arguments, and ends in the facetious worship of a donkey. The higher men thank Zarathustra for relieving them of their distress and teaching them to be content with life.\nThe following morning, outside his cave, Zarathustra encounters a lion and a flock of doves, which he interprets as a sign that those whom he calls his children are near. As the higher men emerge from the cave, the lion roars at them, causing them to cry out and flee. Their cry reminds Zarathustra of the soothsayer's prediction that he would be tempted into feeling compassion for the higher man. He declares that this is over, and that from this time forward he will think of nothing but his work.\n\n\n== Themes ==\n\nScholars have argued that \"the worst possible way to understand Zarathustra is as a teacher of doctrines\". Nonetheless Thus Spoke Zarathustra \"has contributed most to the public perception of Nietzsche as philosopher – namely, as the teacher of the 'doctrines' of the will to power, the overman and the eternal return\".\n\n\n=== Will to power ===\n\nNietzsche's thinking was significantly influenced by the thinking of Arthur Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer emphasised will, and particularly will to live. Nietzsche emphasised Wille zur Macht, or will to power.\nNietzsche was not a systematic philosopher and left much of what he wrote open to interpretation. Receptive fascists are said to have misinterpreted the will to power, having overlooked Nietzsche's distinction between Kraft ‘force, strength’ and Macht ‘power, might’.\nScholars have often had recourse to Nietzsche's notebooks, where will to power is described in ways such as \"willing-to-become-stronger [Stärker-werden-wollen], willing growth\".\n\n\n=== Übermensch ===\n\nIt is allegedly \"well-known that as a term, Nietzsche’s Übermensch derives from Lucian of Samosata's hyperanthropos\". This hyperanthropos, or \"overman,\" appears in Lucian's Menippean satire Κατάπλους ἢ Τύραννος, usually translated Downward Journey or The Tyrant. This hyperanthropos is \"imagined to be superior to others of 'lesser' station in this-worldly life and the same tyrant after his (comically unwilling) transport into the underworld\".\nNietzsche celebrated Goethe as an actualisation of the Übermensch.\n\n\n=== Eternal recurrence ===\n\nNietzsche includes some brief writings on eternal recurrence in his earlier book The Gay Science. Zarathustra also appears in that book. In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the eternal recurrence is, according to Nietzsche, the \"fundamental idea of the work\".\nInterpretations of the eternal recurrence have mostly revolved around cosmological and attitudinal and normative principles.\nAs a cosmological principle, it has been supposed to mean that time is circular, that all things recur eternally. A weak attempt at proof has been noted in Nietzsche's notebooks, and it is not clear to what extent, if at all, Nietzsche believed in the truth of it. Critics have mostly dealt with the cosmological principle as a puzzle of why Nietzsche might have touted the idea.\nAs an attitudinal principle it has often been dealt with as a thought experiment, to see how one would react, or as a sort of ultimate expression of life-affirmation, as if one should desire eternal recurrence.\nAs a normative principle, it has been thought of as a measure or standard, akin to a \"moral rule\".\n\n\n=== Criticism of religion ===\nNietzsche studied extensively and was very familiar with Schopenhauer and Christianity and Buddhism, each of which he considered nihilistic and \"enemies to a healthy culture\". Thus Spoke Zarathustra can be understood as a \"polemic\" against these influences.\nThough Nietzsche \"probably learned Sanskrit while at Leipzig from 1865 to 1868\", and \"was probably one of the best read and most solidly grounded in Buddhism for his time among Europeans\", Nietzsche was writing when Eastern thought was only beginning to be acknowledged in the West, and Eastern thought was easily misconstrued. Nietzsche's interpretations of Buddhism were coloured by his study of Schopenhauer, and it is \"clear that Nietzsche, as well as Schopenhauer, entertained inaccurate views of Buddhism\". An egregious example has been the idea of śūnyatā as \"nothingness\" rather than \"emptiness\". \"Perhaps the most serious misreading we find in Nietzsche's account of Buddhism was his inability to recognize that the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness was an initiatory stage leading to a reawakening\". Nietzsche dismissed Schopenhauer and Christianity and Buddhism as pessimistic and nihilistic, but, according to Benjamin A. Elman, \"[w]hen understood on its own terms, Buddhism cannot be dismissed as pessimistic or nihilistic\". Moreover, answers which Nietzsche assembled to the questions he was asking, not only generally but also in Zarathustra, put him \"very close to some basic doctrines found in Buddhism\". An example is when Zarathustra says that \"the soul is only a word for something about the body\".\n\n\n=== Nihilism ===\nOne of the most vexed points in discussions of Nietzsche has been whether or not he was a nihilist. Though arguments have been made for either side, what is clear is that Nietzsche was at least interested in nihilism.\nAs far as nihilism touched other people, at least, metaphysical understandings of the world were progressively undermined until people could contend that \"God is dead\". Without God, humanity was greatly devalued. Without metaphysical or supernatural lenses, humans could be seen as animals with primitive drives which were or could be sublimated. According to Hollingdale, this led to Nietzsche's ideas about the will to power. Likewise, \"Sublimated will to power was now the Ariadne's thread tracing the way out of the labyrinth of nihilism\".\n\n\n== Style ==\n\nThe nature of the text is musical and operatic. While working on it Nietzsche wrote \"of his aim 'to become Wagner's heir'\". Nietzsche thought of it as akin to a symphony or opera. \"No lesser a symphonist than Gustav Mahler corroborates: 'His Zarathustra was born completely from the spirit of music, and is even \"symphonically constructed\"'\". Nietzschelater draws special attention to \"the tempo of Zarathustra's speeches\" and their \"delicate slowness\"  –  \"from an infinite fullness of light and depth of happiness drop falls after drop, word after word\" –  as well as the necessity of \"hearing properly the tone that issues from his mouth, this halcyon tone\". The length of paragraphs and the punctuation and the repetitions all enhance the musicality.\nThe title is Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Much of the book is what Zarathustra said. What Zarathustra says is throughout so highly parabolic, metaphorical, and aphoristic. Rather than state various claims about virtues and the present age and religion and aspirations, Zarathustra speaks about stars, animals, trees, tarantulas, dreams, and so forth. Explanations and claims are almost always analogical and figurative.\nNietzsche would often appropriate masks and models to develop himself and his thoughts and ideas, and to find voices and names through which to communicate. While writing Zarathustra, Nietzsche was particularly influenced by \"the language of Luther and the poetic form of the Bible\". But Zarathustra also frequently alludes to or appropriates from Hölderlin's Hyperion and Goethe's Faust and Emerson's Essays, among other things. It is generally agreed that the sorcerer is based on Wagner and the soothsayer is based on Schopenhauer.\nThe original text contains a great deal of word-play. For instance, words beginning with über ('over, above') and unter ('down, below') are often paired to emphasise the contrast, which is not always possible to bring out in translation, except by coinages. An example is untergang (lit. 'down-going'), which is used in German to mean 'setting' (as in, of the sun), but also 'sinking', 'demise', 'downfall', or 'doom'. Nietzsche pairs this word with its opposite übergang ('over-going'), used to mean 'transition'. Another example is übermensch ('overman' or 'superman').\nNietzsche's style is figuratively and metaphorically rich with complex ideas that may let the reader find them hard to interpret. He does not follow a straightforward philosophical discourse; instead, he uses poetic, rhetorical narratives to convey Zarathustra's development of character. This richness of language can be ambiguous for readers to understand because it includes paradoxes, contradictions and parables, which requires \"literary interpretations to unpack the language\". \n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nNietzsche considered Thus Spoke Zarathustra his magnum opus, writing:\n\nWith [Thus Spoke Zarathustra] I have given mankind the greatest present that has ever been made to it so far. This book, with a voice bridging centuries, is not only the highest book there is, the book that is truly characterized by the air of the heights—the whole fact of man lies beneath it at a tremendous distance—it is also the deepest, born out of the innermost wealth of truth, an inexhaustible well to which no pail descends without coming up again filled with gold and goodness.\nIn a letter of February 1884, he wrote:\n\nWith Zarathustra I believe I have brought the German language to its culmination. After Luther and Goethe there was still a third step to be made.\nTo this, Parkes has said: \"Many scholars believe that Nietzsche managed to make that step\". But critical opinion varies extremely. The book is \"a masterpiece of literature as well as philosophy\" and \"in large part a failure\".\nThe style of the book, along with its ambiguity and paradoxical nature, has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis (as Nietzsche may have intended). Thus Spoke Zarathustra remained unpopular as a topic for scholars (especially those in the Anglo-American analytic tradition) until the latter half of the 20th century brought widespread interest in Nietzsche and his unconventional style.\nThe critic Harold Bloom criticized Thus Spoke Zarathustra in The Western Canon (1994), calling it \"a gorgeous disaster\" and \"unreadable\". Other commentators have suggested that Nietzsche's style is intentionally ironic for much of the book.\n\n\n== English translations ==\nThe first English translation of Zarathustra was published in 1896 by Alexander Tille.\n\n\n=== Common (1909) ===\nThomas Common published a translation in 1909 which was based on Alexander Tille's earlier attempt.\nKaufmann's introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of Common's version; he notes that in one instance, Common has taken the German \"most evil\" and rendered it \"baddest\", a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term \"baddest\", but also because Nietzsche dedicated a third of The Genealogy of Morals to the difference between \"bad\" and \"evil\". This and other errors led Kaufmann to wonder whether Common \"had little German and less English\".\nThe German text available to Common was considerably flawed.\nFrom Zarathustra's Prologue:\n\nThe Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The Superman shall be the meaning of the earth!I conjure you, my brethren, remain true to the earth, and believe not those who speak unto you of superearthly hopes! Poisoners are they, whether they know it or not.\n\n\n=== Kaufmann (1954) and Hollingdale (1961) ===\nThe Common translation remained widely accepted until more critical translations, titled Thus Spoke Zarathustra, were published by Walter Kaufmann in 1954, and R.J. Hollingdale in 1961.\nClancy Martin states the German text from which Hollingdale and Kaufmann worked was untrue to Nietzsche's own work in some ways. Martin criticizes Kaufmann for changing punctuation, altering literal and philosophical meanings, and dampening some of Nietzsche's more controversial metaphors. Kaufmann's version, which has become the most widely available, features a translator's note suggesting that Nietzsche's text would have benefited from an editor; Martin suggests that Kaufmann \"took it upon himself to become [Nietzsche's] editor\".\nKaufmann, from Zarathustra's Prologue:\n\nThe overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not.\nHollingdale, from Zarathustra's Prologue:\n\nThe Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the Superman shall be the meaning of the earth!I entreat you, my brothers, remain true to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of superterrestrial hopes! They are poisoners, whether they know it or not.\n\n\n=== 21st-century translations ===\n\n\n==== Parkes (2005) ====\nGraham Parkes describes his own 2005 translation as trying to convey the musicality of the text.\n\n\n==== Del Caro (2006) ====\nIn 2006, Cambridge University Press published a translation by Adrian Del Caro (edited by Del Caro and Robert Pippin); this edition aims to restore the original versification of Nietzsche's text and \"capture its poetic brilliance\", in the words of the publisher.\n\n\n== Selected editions ==\n\n\n=== English ===\nThus Spake Zarathustra, translated by Alexander Tille.

    "full_narrative": "Being and Time (German: Sein und Zeit) is the 1927 magnum opus of German philosopher Martin Heidegger and a key document of existentialism. Being and Time had a notable impact on subsequent philosophy, literary theory and many other fields. Though controversial, its stature in intellectual history has been compared with works by Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel. The book attempts to revive ontology through an analysis of Dasein, or \"being-in-the-world.\" It is also noted for an array of neologisms and complex language, as well as an extended treatment of \"authenticity\" as a means to grasp and confront the unique and finite possibilities of the individual.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRichard Wolin notes that the work \"implicitly adopted the critique of mass society\" epitomized earlier by Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. \"Elitist complaints about the 'dictatorship of public opinion' were common currency to the German mandarins of the twenties,\" according to Jürgen Habermas (1989). Wolin writes that Being and Time is \"suffused by a sensibility derived from secularized Protestantism\" and its stress on original sin. The human condition is portrayed as \"essentially a curse.\" Wolin cites the work's extended emphasis on \"emotionally laden concepts\" like guilt, conscience, angst and death.\nThe book is likened to a secularized version of Martin Luther's project, which aimed to turn Christian theology back to an earlier and more \"original\" phase. Taking this view, John D. Caputo notes that Heidegger made a systematic study of Luther in the 1920s after training for 10 years as a Catholic theologian. Similarly, Hubert Dreyfus likens Division II of the volume to a secularized version of Kierkegaard's Christianity. Almost all central concepts of Being and Time are derived from Augustine, Luther, and Kierkegaard, according to Christian Lotz.\nThe critic George Steiner argues that Being and Time is a product of the crisis of German culture following Germany's defeat in World War I. In this respect Steiner compared it to Ernst Bloch's The Spirit of Utopia (1918), Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West (1918), Franz Rosenzweig's The Star of Redemption (1921), Karl Barth's The Epistle to the Romans (1922), and Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf (1925).\nIn terms of structure, Being and Time consists of the lengthy two-part introduction, followed by Division One, the \"Preparatory Fundamental Analysis of Dasein,\" and Division Two, \"Dasein and Temporality.\" Heidegger originally planned to write a separate, second volume, but quickly abandoned the project. The unwritten \"second half\" was to include a critique of Western philosophy.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Dasein ===\nBeing and Time explicitly rejects Descartes' notion of the human being as a subjective spectator of objects, according to Marcella Horrigan-Kelly (et al.). The book instead holds that both subject and object are inseparable. In presenting the subject, \"being\" as inseparable from the objective \"world,\" Heidegger introduced the term \"Dasein\" (literally being there), intended to embody a \"living being\" through their activity of \"being there\" and \"being in the world\" (Horrigan-Kelly). Understood as a unitary phenomenon rather than a contingent, additive combination, being-in-the-world is an essential characteristic of Dasein, according to Michael Wheeler (2011).\nHeidegger's account of Dasein passes through an analysis of angst, \"the Nothing\" and mortality, and of the structure of \"care\" as such. He then defines \"authenticity,\" as a means to grasp and confront the finite possibilities of Dasein. Moreover, Dasein is \"the being that will give access to the question of the meaning of Being,\" according to Heidegger.\n\n\n=== Being ===\nThe work claims that ordinary and even mundane \"being-in-the-world\" provides \"access to the meaning, or 'sense of being' [Sinn des Seins].\" This access via Dasein is also that \"in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something.\" This meaning would then elucidate ordinary \"prescientific\" understanding, which precedes abstract ways of knowing, such as logic or theory.\nHeidegger's concept of Being is metaphorical, according to Richard Rorty, who agrees with Heidegger that there is no \"hidden power\" called Being. Heidegger emphasizes that no particular understanding of Being (nor of Dasein) is to be valued over another, according to an account of Rorty's analysis by Edward Grippe. This supposed \"non-linguistic, pre-cognitive access\" to the meaning of Being did not underscore any particular, preferred narrative.\nThomas Sheehan and Mark Wrathall each separately assert that commentators' emphasis on the term \"Being\" is misplaced, and that Heidegger's central focus was never on \"Being\" as such. Wrathall wrote (2011) that Heidegger's elaborate concept of \"unconcealment\" was his central, life-long focus, while Sheehan (2015) proposed that the philosopher's prime focus was on that which \"brings about being as a givenness of entities.\"\nBeing and Time actually offers \"no sense of how we might answer the question of being as such,\" writes Simon Critchley in a nine-part blog commentary on the work for The Guardian (2009). The book instead provides \"an answer to the question of what it means to be human\" (Critchley). Nonetheless, Heidegger does present the concept: \"'Being' is not something like a being but is rather \"what determines beings as beings.\"\n\n\n=== Time ===\nHeidegger believes that time finds its meaning in death, according to Michael Kelley. That is, time is understood only from a finite or mortal vantage. Dasein's fundamental characteristic and mode of \"being-in-the-world\" is temporal: Having been \"thrown\" into a world implies a \"pastness\" in its being. \"The present is the nodal moment which makes past and future intelligible,\" writes Lilian Alweiss. Dasein occupies itself with the present tasks required by goals it has projected on the future.\nDasein as an intertwined subject/object cannot be separated from its objective \"historicality,\" a concept Heidegger credits in the text to Wilhelm Dilthey. Dasein is \"stretched along\" temporally between birth and death, and thrown into its world; into its future possibilities which Dasein is charged with assuming. Dasein's access to this world and these possibilities is always via a history and a tradition—or \"world historicality\".\n\n\n== Methodologies ==\n\n\n=== Phenomenology ===\n\nHeidegger's mentor Edmund Husserl developed a method of analysis called \"phenomenological reduction\" or \"bracketing,\" that emphasized primordial experience as its key element. Husserl used this method to define the structures of consciousness and show how they are directed at both real and ideal objects within the world.\nBeing and Time employs this method but purportedly modifies Husserl's subjectivist tendencies. Whereas Husserl conceived humans as constituted by consciousness, Heidegger countered that consciousness is peripheral to Dasein, which cannot be reduced to consciousness. Consciousness is thus an \"effect\" rather than a determinant of existence. By shifting the priority from consciousness (psychology) to existence (ontology), Heidegger altered the subsequent direction of phenomenology.\nBut Being and Time misrepresented its phenomenology as a departure from methods established earlier by Husserl, according to Daniel O. Dahlstrom. In this vein, Robert J. Dostal asserts that \"if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach,\" then it's impossible to exactly understand Being and Time.\nOn publication in 1927, Being and Time bore a dedication to Husserl, who beginning a decade earlier, championed Heidegger's work, and helped him secure the retiring Husserl's chair in Philosophy at the University of Freiburg in 1928. Because Husserl was Jewish, in 1941 Heidegger, then a member of the Nazi Party, agreed to remove the dedication from Being and Time (restored in 1953 edition).\n\n\n=== Hermeneutics ===\n\nBeing and Time employed the \"hermeneutic circle\" as a method of analysis or structure for ideas. According to Susann M. Laverty (2003), Heidegger's circle moves from the parts of experience to the whole of experience and back and forth again and again to increase the depth of engagement and understanding. Laverty writes (Kvale 1996), \"This spiraling through a hermeneutic circle ends when one has reached a place of sensible meaning, free of inner contradictions, for the moment.\"\nThe hermeneutic circle and certain theories concerning history in Being and Time are acknowledged within the text to rely on the writings of Wilhelm Dilthey. The technique was later employed in the writings of Jürgen Habermas, per \"Influence and reception\" below.\n\n\n=== Destructuring ===\n\nIn Being and Time Heidegger briefly refutes the philosophy of René Descartes (in an exercise he called \"destructuring\"), but the second volume, intended as a Destruktion of Western philosophy, was never written. Heidegger sought to explain how theoretical knowledge came to be seen, incorrectly in his view, as fundamental to being. This explanation takes the form of a destructuring (Destruktion) of the philosophical tradition, an interpretative strategy that reveals the fundamental experience of being hidden within the theoretical attitude of the metaphysics of presence.\nIn later works, while becoming less systematic and more obscure than in Being and Time, Heidegger turns to the exegesis of historical texts, especially those of Presocratic philosophers, but also of Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Plato, Nietzsche, and Hölderlin, among others.\n\n\n== Influence and reception ==\nUpon its publication, reviewers credited Heidegger with \"brilliance\" and \"genius\". The book was later seen as the \"most influential version of existential philosophy.\" \nJean-Paul Sartre's existentialism (of 1943) has been described as merely \"a version of Being and Time\". The work also influenced other philosophers of Sartre's generation, and exerted a notable influence on French philosophy.\nHeidegger's work influenced the output of the Frankfurt School including Jürgen Habermas's hermeneutics and Herbert Marcuse's early and abortive attempt to develop \"Heideggerian Marxism.\" Theodor Adorno, in his 1964 book The Jargon of Authenticity, was critical of Heidegger's popularity in post-war Western Europe. Adorno accused Heidegger of evading ethical judgment by disingenuously presenting \"authenticity\" as a value-free, technical term – rather than a positive doctrine of the good life.\nHeidegger influenced psychoanalysis through Jacques Lacan as well as Medard Boss and others. Paul Celan, in his essays on poetic theory, incorporated some of Heidegger's ideas. Being and Time also separately influenced Alain Badiou's work Being and Event (1988), and also separately the enactivist approach to cognition theory.\nBertrand Russell was dismissive of Being and Time (\"One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot\"), and the analytic philosopher A. J. Ayer outright called Heidegger a charlatan. But the American philosopher Richard Rorty ranked Heidegger among the important philosophers of the twentieth century, including John Dewey and Ludwig Wittgenstein. \nThe conservative British writer Roger Scruton (2002) called Being and Time a \"description of a private spiritual journey\" rather than genuine philosophy. But Stephen Houlgate (1999) compares Heidegger's achievements in Being and Time to those of Kant and Hegel. Simon Critchley (2009) writes that it is impossible to understand developments in continental philosophy after Heidegger without understanding Being and Time.\n\n\n== Related work ==\nBeing and Time is the major achievement of Heidegger's early career, but he produced other important works during this period:\n\nThe publication in 1992 of the early lecture course, Platon: Sophistes (Plato's Sophist, 1924), made clear the way in which Heidegger's reading of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics was crucial to the formulation of the thought expressed in Being and Time.\nThe lecture course, Prolegomena zur Geschichte des Zeitbegriffs (History of the Concept of Time: Prolegomena, 1925), was something like an early version of Being and Time.\nThe lecture courses immediately following the publication of Being and Time, such as Die Grundprobleme der Phänomenologie (The Basic Problems of Phenomenology, 1927), and Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik (Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, 1929), elaborated some elements of the destruction of metaphysics which Heidegger intended to pursue in the unwritten second part of Being and Time.\nAlthough Heidegger did not complete the project outlined in Being and Time, later works explicitly addressed the themes and concepts of Being and Time. Most important among the works which do so are the following:\n\nHeidegger's inaugural lecture upon his return to Freiburg, \"Was ist Metaphysik?\" (What Is Metaphysics?, 1929), was an important and influential clarification of what Heidegger meant by being, non-being, and nothingness.\nEinführung in die Metaphysik (An Introduction to Metaphysics), a lecture course delivered in 1935, is identified by Heidegger, in his preface to the seventh German edition of Being and Time, as relevant to the concerns which the second half of the book would have addressed.\nBeiträge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis) (Contributions to Philosophy [From Enowning], composed 1936–38, published 1989), a sustained attempt at reckoning with the legacy of Being and Time.\nZeit und Sein (Time and Being), a lecture delivered at the University of Freiburg on January 31, 1962. This was Heidegger's most direct confrontation with Being and Time. It was followed by a seminar on the lecture, which took place at Todtnauberg on September 11–13, 1962, a summary of which was written by Alfred Guzzoni. Both the lecture and the summary of the seminar are included in Zur Sache des Denkens (1969; translated as On Time and Being, New York: Harper & Row, 1972).\n\n\n== See also ==\nExistential isolation\nHeideggerian terminology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n==== Primary literature ====\nMartin Heidegger, Sein und Zeit, in Heidegger's Gesamtausgabe, volume 2, ed.

    "description": "The Myth of Sisyphus (French: Le mythe de Sisyphe) is a 1942 philosophical work by Albert Camus. Influenced by philosophers such as Søren Kierkegaard, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Friedrich Nietzsche, Camus introduces his philosophy of the absurd. The absurd lies in the juxtaposition between the fundamental human need to attribute meaning to life and the \"unreasonable silence\" of the universe in response. Camus claims that the realization of the absurd does not justify suicide, and instead requires \"revolt\". He then outlines several approaches to the absurd life. In the final chapter, Camus compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of Sisyphus, a figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll down again just as it nears the top. The essay concludes, \"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart.

Influenced by philosophers such as Søren Kierkegaard, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Friedrich Nietzsche, Camus introduces his philosophy of the absurd. The absurd lies in the juxtaposition between the fundamental human need to attribute meaning to life and the \"unreasonable silence\" of the universe in response. Camus claims that the realization of the absurd does not justify suicide, and instead requires \"revolt\". He then outlines several approaches to the absurd life. In the final chapter, Camus compares the absurdity of man's life with the situation of Sisyphus, a figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to see it roll down again just as it nears the top. The essay concludes, \"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"\nThe work can be seen in relation to other absurdist works by Camus: the novel The Stranger (1942), the plays The Misunderstanding (1942) and Caligula (1944), and especially the essay The Rebel (1951).\n\n\n== History ==\nCamus began the work in 1940, during the Fall of France, when millions of refugees fled from advancing German armies. While the essay rarely refers to this event, Robert Zaretsky argues that the event prompted his ideas of the absurd. He claims that both a banal event and something as intense as a German invasion will prompt someone to ask \"why?\"  The essay was published in French in 1942.\nThe English translation by Justin O'Brien was first published in 1955. Included in the translated version is a preface written by Camus while in Paris in 1955. Here Camus states that \"even if one does not believe in God, suicide is not legitimate\".\n\n\n== Philosophical context ==\nCamus wrote The Myth of Sisyphus against the backdrop of early twentieth-century European philosophy, particularly existentialism and phenomenology. Although often grouped with existentialist thinkers, Camus consistently rejected the existentialist label, insisting that his philosophy of the absurd was distinct from both Kierkegaard’s leap of faith and Heidegger’s ontology of Being. Instead, Camus argued that the confrontation between humanity’s “appetite for meaning” and the universe’s “unreasonable silence” constituted the absurd, which must be lived with clarity rather than resolved by appeal to transcendence.\nScholars note that Camus diverged sharply from Soren Kierkegaard and Lev Shestov, who posited that faith provided the only way beyond despair. Camus considered such responses forms of “philosophical suicide,” since they abandon reason in favor of religious or metaphysical hope. Similarly, he critiqued Husserlian phenomenology and Hegelian rationalism for elevating reason into abstract systems that obscure the absurd rather than confront it directly. \nCommentators have also situated Camus in dialogue with Friedrich Nietzsche. While Nietzsche’s notion of eternal recurrence and affirmation of life informed Camus’s emphasis on revolt and freedom, Camus rejected Nietzsche’s metaphysical implications and instead grounded his thought in the lived experience of the absurd.\nIn later interpretations, philosophers such as Thomas Nagel and Ronald Aronson have highlighted how Camus’s concept of the absurd continues to shape debates in existential ethics, modern humanism, and the philosophy of meaning.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe essay is dedicated to Pascal Pia and is organized in four chapters and one appendix.\n\n\n=== Chapter 1: An Absurd Reasoning ===\nCamus undertakes the task of answering what he considers to be the only question of philosophy that matters: Does the realization of the meaninglessness and absurdity of life necessarily require suicide?\nHe begins by describing the following absurd condition: we build our life on the hope for tomorrow, yet tomorrow brings us closer to death and is the ultimate enemy; people live their lives as if they were not aware of the certainty of death. Once stripped of its common romanticism, the world is a foreign, strange and inhuman place; true knowledge is impossible and rationality and science cannot explain the world: their stories ultimately end in meaningless abstractions, in metaphors. This is the absurd condition and \"from the moment absurdity is recognized, it becomes a passion, the most harrowing of all.\"\nIt is not the world that is absurd, nor human thought: the absurd arises when the human need to understand meets the unreasonableness of the world, when the \"appetite for the absolute and for unity\" meets \"the impossibility of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle.\"\nHe then characterizes several philosophies that describe and attempt to deal with this feeling of the absurd, by Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers, Lev Shestov, Søren Kierkegaard, and Edmund Husserl. All of these, he claims, commit \"philosophical suicide\" by reaching conclusions that contradict the original absurd position, either by abandoning reason and turning to God, as in the case of Kierkegaard and Shestov, or by elevating reason and ultimately arriving at ubiquitous Platonic forms and an abstract god, as in the case of Husserl.\nFor Camus, who sets out to take the absurd seriously and follow it to its final conclusions, these \"leaps\" cannot convince. Taking the absurd seriously means acknowledging the contradiction between the desire of human reason and the unreasonable world. Suicide, then, also must be rejected: without man, the absurd cannot exist. The contradiction must be lived; reason and its limits must be acknowledged, without false hope. However, the absurd can never be permanently accepted: it requires constant confrontation, constant revolt.\nWhile the question of human freedom in the metaphysical sense loses interest to the absurd man, he gains freedom in a very concrete sense: no longer bound by hope for a better future or eternity, without a need to pursue life's purpose or to create meaning, \"he enjoys a freedom with regard to common rules\".\nTo embrace the absurd implies embracing all that the unreasonable world has to offer. Without meaning in life, there is no scale of values. \"What counts is not the best living but the most living.\"\nThus, Camus arrives at three consequences from fully acknowledging the absurd: revolt, freedom, and passion.\n\n\n=== Chapter 2: The Absurd Man ===\nHow should the absurd man live? Clearly, no ethical rules apply, as they are all based on higher powers or on justification. \"...integrity has no need of rules... 'Everything is permitted,'... is not an outburst of relief or of joy, but rather a bitter acknowledgement of a fact.\"\nCamus then goes on to present examples of the absurd life. He begins with Don Juan, the serial seducer who lives the passionate life to the fullest. \"There is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be both short-lived and exceptional.\"\nThe next example is the actor, who depicts ephemeral lives for ephemeral fame. \"He demonstrates to what degree appearing creates being. In those three hours, he travels the whole course of the dead-end path that the man in the audience takes a lifetime to cover.\"\nCamus's third example of the absurd man is the conqueror, the warrior who forgoes all promises of eternity to affect and engage fully in human history. He chooses action over contemplation, aware of the fact that nothing can last and no victory is final.\n\n\n=== Chapter 3: Absurd Creation ===\nHere Camus explores the absurd creator or artist.  Since explanation is impossible, absurd art is restricted to a description of the myriad experiences in the world. \"If the world were clear, art would not exist.\" Absurd creation, of course, also must refrain from judging and from alluding to even the slightest shadow of hope.\nHe then analyzes the work of Fyodor Dostoevsky in this light, especially The Diary of a Writer,  The Possessed and The Brothers Karamazov. All these works start from the absurd position, and the first two explore the theme of philosophical suicide. However, both The Diary and his last novel, The Brothers Karamazov, ultimately find a path to hope and faith and thus fail as truly absurd creations.\n\n\n=== Chapter 4: The Myth of Sisyphus ===\n\nIn the last chapter, Camus outlines the legend of Sisyphus who defied the gods and put Death in chains so that no human needed to die. When Death was eventually liberated and it came time for Sisyphus himself to die, he concocted a deceit which let him escape from the underworld. After finally capturing Sisyphus, the gods decided that his punishment would last for all eternity. He would have to push a rock up a mountain; upon reaching the top, the rock would roll down again, leaving Sisyphus to start over. Camus sees Sisyphus as the absurd hero who lives life to the fullest, hates death, and is condemned to a meaningless task.\nCamus presents Sisyphus's ceaseless and pointless toil as a metaphor for modern lives spent working at futile jobs in factories and offices. \"The workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious.\"\nCamus is interested in Sisyphus's thoughts when marching down the mountain, to start anew. After the stone falls back down the mountain Camus states that \"It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end.\" This is the truly tragic moment when the hero becomes conscious of his wretched condition. He does not have hope, but \"there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.\" Acknowledging the truth will conquer it; Sisyphus, just like the absurd man, continues pushing. Camus claims that when Sisyphus acknowledges the futility of his task and the certainty of his fate, he is freed to realize the absurdity of his situation and to reach a state of contented acceptance.  With a nod to the similarly cursed Greek hero Oedipus, Camus concludes that \"all is well,\" continuing \"one must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"\n\n\n=== Appendix ===\nThe essay contains an appendix titled \"Hope and the Absurd in the work of Franz Kafka\". While Camus acknowledges that Kafka's work represents an exquisite description of the absurd condition, he claims that Kafka fails as an absurd writer because his work retains a glimmer of hope.\n\n\n=== Ending ===\n\"I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nEternal return\nTheatre of the Absurd\nThe Sickness Unto Death by Søren Kierkegaard\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays, Albert Camus, Alfred A.

However, the book has been criticized for its abstruseness and for its treatment of Freud.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Descartes ===\nSartre's existentialism shares its philosophical starting point with René Descartes: The first thing we can be aware of is our existence, even when doubting everything else (Cogito ergo sum). In Nausea, the main character's feeling of dizziness towards his own existence is induced by things, not thinking. This dizziness occurs \"in the face of one's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality\". As an important break with Descartes, Sartre rejects the primacy of knowledge (a rejection summed up in the phrase \"Existence precedes essence\") and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness.\n\n\n=== Husserl ===\nImportant ideas in Being and Nothingness build on Edmund Husserl's phenomenology. To both philosophers, consciousness is intentional, meaning that there is only consciousness of something. For Sartre, intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness (such as Husserl's transcendental ego). An ego must be a structure outside consciousness, so that there can be consciousness of the ego.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nIn the introduction, Sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness, being, and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists (most notably Husserl and Heidegger) as well as idealists, rationalists, and empiricists. According to him, one of the major achievements of modern philosophy is phenomenology because it disproved the kinds of dualism that set the existent up as having a \"hidden\" nature (such as Immanuel Kant's noumenon); Phenomenology has removed \"the illusion of worlds behind the scene\".\nBased on an examination of the nature of phenomena, he describes the nature of two types of being, being-in-itself (the being of things) and being-for-itself. While being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human beings, being-for-itself is the being of consciousness.\n\n\n=== Part 1, Chapter 1: The origin of negation ===\nFrom Sartre's phenomenological point of view, nothingness is an experienced reality and cannot be a merely subjective mistake. The absence of a friend and absence of money hint at a being of nothingness. It is part of reality. In the first chapter, Sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book, especially to his account for bad faith and freedom. For him, nothingness is not just a mental concept that sums up negative judgements such as \"Pierre is not here\" and \"I have no money\". Though \"it is evident that non-being always appears within the limits of a human expectation\", the concrete nothingness differs from mere abstract inexistence, such as the square circle. A concrete nothingness, e.g. not being able to see, is part of a totality: the life of the blind man in this world. This totality is modified by the nothingness which is part of it.\nIn the totality of consciousness and phenomenon (Heidegger's being-in-the-world), both can be considered separately, but exist only as a whole (intentionality of consciousness). The human attitude of inquiry, of asking questions, puts consciousness at distance from the world. Every question brings up the possibility of a negative answer, of non-being, e.g. \"Who is entering? No one.\" For Sartre, this is how nothingness can exist at all. Non-being can neither be part of the being-in-itself nor can it be as a complement of it. Being-for-itself is the origin of negation. The relation between being-for-itself and being-in-itself is one of questioning the latter. By bringing nothingness into the world, consciousness does not annihilate the being of things, but changes its relation to it.\n\n\n=== Part 1, Chapter 2: Bad faith ===\nAs bad faith, Sartre describes one's self-deception about the human reality. It can take two forms, the first one is making oneself falsely believe not to be what one actually is. The second one is conceiving oneself as an object (e.g. being identical to a job) and thereby denying freedom.\nThis essentially means that in being a waiter, grocer, etc., one must believe that their social role is equivalent to their human existence. Living a life defined by one's occupation, social, racial, or economic class, is the very essence of \"bad faith\", the condition in which people cannot transcend their situations in order to realize what they must be (human) and what they are not (waiter, grocer, etc.). It is also essential for an existent to understand that negation allows the self to enter what Sartre calls the \"great human stream\". The great human stream arises from a singular realization that nothingness is a state of mind in which we can become anything, in reference to our situation, that we desire.\nThe difference between existence and identity projection remains at the heart of human subjects who are swept up by their own condition, their \"bad faith\". An example of projection that Sartre uses is the café waiter who performs the duties, traditions, functions, and expectations of a café waiter:\n\n[W]hat are we then if we have the constant obligation to make ourselves what we are if our mode of being is having the obligation to be what we are? Let us consider this waiter in the café. His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer. Finally there he returns, trying to imitate in his walk the inflexible stiffness of some kind of automaton while carrying his tray with the recklessness of a tight-rope-walker by putting it in a perpetually unstable, perpetually broken equilibrium which he perpetually re-establishes by a light movement of the arm and hand. All his behavior seems to us a game. He applies himself to changing his movements as if they were mechanisms, the one regulating the other; his gestures and even his voice seems to be mechanisms; he gives himself the quickness and pitiless rapidity of things. He is playing, he is amusing himself. But what is he playing? We need not watch long before we can explain it: he is playing at being  a waiter in a café. There is nothing there to surprise us.\nSartre also gives, as an example of bad faith, the attitude of the homosexual who denies that he is a homosexual, feeling that \"a homosexual is not a homosexual\" in the same sense that a table is a table or a red-haired man is red-haired. Sartre argues that such an attitude is partially correct since it is based in the \"irreducible character of human reality\", but that it would be fully correct only if the homosexual accepted that he is a homosexual in the sense that he has adopted a pattern of conduct defined as that of a homosexual, although not one \"to the extent that human reality can not be finally defined by patterns of conduct\".\nSartre consistently mentions that in order to get out of bad faith, one must realize that one's existence and one's formal projection of a self are distinctly separate and within the means of human control. This separation is a form of nothingness. Nothingness, in terms of bad faith, is characterized by Sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity, and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner. An example is something that is what it is (existence) and something that is what it is not (a waiter defined by his occupation).\nHowever, Sartre takes a stance against characterizing bad faith in terms of \"mere social positions\". Says Sartre, \"I am never any one of my attitudes, any one of my actions.\" The good speaker is the one who plays at speaking because he cannot be speaking. This literally means that, like the café waiter, the speaker is not his condition or social categorization, but is a speaker consumed by bad faith. Thus, we must realize what we are (beings who exist) and what we are not (a social/historical preoccupation) in order to step out of bad faith. Yet, existents (human beings) must maintain a balance between existence, their roles, and nothingness to become authentic beings.\nAdditionally, an important tenet of bad faith is that we must enact a bit of \"good faith\" in order to take advantage of our role to reach an authentic existence. The authentic domain of bad faith is realizing that the role we are playing is the lie. To live and project into the future as a project of a self, while keeping out of bad faith and living by the will of the self is living life authentically.\nOne of the most important implications of bad faith is the abolition of traditional ethics. Being a \"moral person\" requires one to deny authentic impulses (everything that makes us human) and allow the will of another person to change one's actions. Being \"a moral person\" is one of the most severe forms of bad faith. Sartre essentially characterizes this as \"the faith of bad faith\" which is and should not be, in Sartre's opinion, at the heart of one's existence. Sartre has a very low opinion of conventional ethics, condemning it as a tool of the bourgeoisie to control the masses.\nBad faith also results when individuals begin to view their life as made up of distinct past events. By viewing one's ego as it once was rather than as it currently is, one ends up negating the current self and replacing it with a past self that no longer exists.\n\n\n=== Part 3, Chapter 1: The look ===\nThe mere possible presence of another person causes one to look at oneself as an object and see one's world as it appears to the other. This is not done from a specific location outside oneself, but is non-positional. This is a recognition of the subjectivity in others.\nThis transformation is most clear when one sees a mannequin that one confuses for a real person for a moment.\n\nWhile they believe it is a person, their world is transformed. Objects now partly escape them; they have aspects that belong to the other person, and that are thus unknowable to them. During this time one can no longer have a total subjectivity. The world is now the other person's world, a foreign world that no longer comes from the self, but from the other. The other person is a \"threat to the order and arrangement of your whole world...Your world is suddenly haunted by the Other's values, over which you have no control\".\nWhen they realise it is a mannequin, and is not subjective, the world seems to transfer back, and they are again in the center of a universe. This is back to the pre-reflective mode of being, it is \"the eye of the camera that is always present but is never seen\". The person is occupied and too busy for self-reflection. This process is continual, unavoidable, and ineluctable.\n\n\n==== Being for Others ====\nSartre states that many relationships are created by people's attraction not to another person, but rather how that person makes them feel about themselves by how they look at them. This is a state of emotional alienation whereby a person avoids experiencing their subjectivity by identifying themselves with \"the look\" of the other. The consequence is conflict. In order to maintain the person's own being, the person must control the other, but must also control the freedom of the other \"as freedom\". These relationships are a profound manifestation of \"bad faith\" as the for-itself is replaced with the other's freedom. The purpose of either participant is not to exist, but to maintain the other participant's looking at them. This system is often mistakenly called \"love\", but it is, in fact, nothing more than emotional alienation and denial of freedom through conflict with the other. Sartre believes that it is often created as a means of making the unbearable anguish of a person's relationship to their \"facticity\" (all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited, such as birthplace and time) bearable. At its extreme, the alienation can become so intense that due to the guilt of being so radically enslaved by \"the look\" and therefore radically missing their own freedoms, the participants can experience masochistic and sadistic attitudes. This happens when the participants cause pain to each other, in attempting to prove their control over the other's look, which they cannot escape because they believe themselves to be so enslaved to the look that experiencing their own subjectivity would be equally unbearable.\n\n\n==== Sex ====\nSartre explains that \"the look\" is the basis for sexual desire, declaring that a biological motivation for sex does not exist. Instead, \"double reciprocal incarnation\" is a form of mutual awareness which Sartre takes to be at the heart of the sexual experience. This involves the mutual recognition of subjectivity of some sort, as Sartre describes: \"I make myself flesh in order to impel the Other to realize for herself and for me her own flesh. My caress causes my flesh to be born for me insofar as it is for the Other flesh causing her to be born as flesh.\"\nEven in sex (perhaps especially in sex), men and women are haunted by a state in which consciousness and bodily being would be in perfect harmony, with desire satisfied. Such a state, however, can never be. We try to bring the beloved's consciousness to the surface of their body by use of magical acts performed, gestures (kisses, desires, etc.), but at the moment of orgasm the illusion is ended and we return to ourselves, just as it is ended when the skier comes to the foot of the mountain or when the commodity that once we desired loses its glow upon our purchase of it. There will be, for Sartre, no such moment of completion because \"man is a useless passion\" to be the ens causa sui, the God of the ontological proof.\n\n\n==== Nothingness ====\nSartre contends that human existence is a conundrum whereby each of us exists, for as long as we live, within an overall condition of nothingness (no thing-ness)—that ultimately allows for free consciousness. Yet simultaneously, within our being (in the physical world), we are constrained to make continuous, conscious choices.\nIt is this dichotomy that causes anguish, because choice (subjectivity) represents a limit on freedom within an otherwise unbridled range of thoughts. Subsequently, humans seek to flee our anguish through action-oriented constructs such as escapes, visualizations, or visions (such as dreams) designed to lead us toward some meaningful end, such as necessity, destiny, determinism (God), etc. Thus, in living our lives, we often become unconscious actors—Bourgeois, Feminist, Worker, Party Member, Frenchman, Canadian or American—each doing as we must to fulfill our chosen characters' destinies.\nHowever, Sartre contends our conscious choices (leading to often unconscious actions) run counter to our intellectual freedom. Yet we are bound to the conditioned and physical world—in which some form of action is always required. This leads to failed dreams of completion, as Sartre described them, because inevitably we are unable to bridge the void between the purity and spontaneity of thought and all-too constraining action; between the being and the nothingness that inherently coincide in our self.\nSartre's recipe for fulfillment is to escape all quests by completing them. This is accomplished by rigorously forcing order onto nothingness, employing the \"spirit (or consciousness of mind) of seriousness\" and describing the failure to do so in terms such as \"bad faith\" and \"false consciousness\". Though Sartre's conclusion seems to be that being diminishes before nothingness since consciousness is probably based more on spontaneity than on stable seriousness, he contends that any person of a serious nature is obliged to continuous struggle between two things:\n\na) The conscious desire for peaceful self-fulfillment through physical actions and social roles—as if living within a portrait that one actively paints of oneself\nb) The more pure and raging spontaneity of no thing consciousness, of being instantaneously free to overturn one's roles, pull up stakes, and strike out on new paths\n\n\n==== Phenomenological ontology ====\nIn Sartre's opinion, consciousness does not make sense by itself: it arises only as an awareness of objects. Consciousness is therefore always and essentially consciousness of something, whether this \"something\" is a thing, a person, an imaginary object, etc. Phenomenologists often refer to this quality of consciousness as \"intentionality\". Sartre's contribution, then, is that in addition to always being consciousness of something, consciousness is always consciousness of itself. In other words, all consciousness is, by definition, self-consciousness. By \"self-consciousness\", Sartre does not mean being aware of oneself thought of as an object (e.g., one's \"ego\"), but rather that, as a phenomenon in the world, consciousness both appears and appears to itself at the same time. By appearing to itself, Sartre argues that consciousness is fully transparent; unlike an ordinary \"object\" (a house, for instance, of which it is impossible to perceive all of the sides at the same time), consciousness \"sees\" all aspects of itself at once. This non-positional quality of consciousness is what makes it a unique type of being, a being that exists for itself.\n\n\n=== Critique of Freud ===\nSartre offers a critique of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious, based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also argues that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed. According to Sartre, in his clinical work, Freud encountered patients who seemed to embody a particular kind of paradox—they appeared to both know and not know the same thing. In response, Freud postulated the existence of the unconscious, which contains the \"truth\" of the traumas underlying the patients' behavior. This \"truth\" is actively repressed, which is made evident by the patients' resistance to its revelation during analysis. Yet what does the resisting if the patients are unaware of what they are repressing? Sartre finds the answer in what Freud calls the \"censor\". \"The only level on which we can locate the refusal of the subject\", Sartre writes, \"is that of the censor.\" Further:\n\n[T]he resistance of the patient implies on the level of the censor an awareness of the thing repressed as such, a comprehension of the end toward which the questions of the psychoanalyst are leading . . . These various operations in their turn imply that the censor is conscious itself. But what type of self-consciousness can the censor have? It must be the consciousness being conscious of the drive to be repressed, but precisely in order not to be conscious of it. What does this mean if not that the censor is in bad faith?\nIn other words, Sartre views Freud's unconscious to be a scapegoat for the paradox of simultaneously knowing and not knowing the same information. Instead of alleviating the paradox, Freud simply moves it to the censor, establishing \"between the unconscious and consciousness an autonomous consciousness in bad faith\". Sartre thinks that the postulation of a censor within the psychic economy is therefore redundant: at the level of the censor, we still encounter the same problem of a consciousness that hides something from itself. For Sartre, what Freud identifies as repression is rather indicative of the larger structure of bad faith. Psychoanalysis thus does not yield any special insight, since hiding something from oneself occurs at the level of consciousness as a unified phenomenon, not as part of some intra-psychic mechanism.\n\n\n== Special terminology used by Sartre ==\n\nExplanation of terms based on appendix to the English edition of Being and Nothingness by translator Hazel Barnes:\n\nBeing (être): Including both Being-in-itself and Being-for-itself (both as defined below), but the latter is the nihilation of the former. Being is objective, not subjective or individual.\nBeing-in-itself (être-en-soi): Non-conscious Being. The sort of phenomenon that is greater than the knowledge that we have of it.\nBeing-for-itself (être-pour-soi): The nihilation of Being-in-itself; consciousness conceived as a lack of Being, a desire for Being, a relation of Being. The For-itself brings Nothingness into the world and therefore can stand out from Being and form attitudes towards other beings by seeing what it is not.\nBeing-for-others (être-pour-autrui): Here a new dimension arises in which the self exists as an object for others. Each For-itself seeks to recover its own Being by making an object out of the other.\nConsciousness: The transcending For-itself. Sartre states that \"Consciousness is a being such that in its being, its being is in question insofar as this being implies a being other than itself.\"\nExistence: Concrete, individual being-for-itself here and now.\nExistence precedes essence. The subjective existence of reality precedes and defines its nature. Who you are (your essence) is defined by what you do (your existence).\nFacticity (facticité): Broadly, facts about the world. More precisely, the For-itself's necessary connection with the In-itself, with the world and its own past.\nFreedom: The very being of the For-itself which is \"condemned to be free\". It must forever choose for itself and therefore make itself.\nNothingness (néant): Although not having being, it is supported by being. It comes into the world by the For-itself.\nReflection (reflet): The form in which the For-itself founds its own nothingness through the dyad of \"the-reflection-reflecting\".\nReflection (réflexion): The consciousness attempting to become its own object.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBeing and Nothingness is considered Sartre's most important philosophical work, and the most important non-fiction expression of his existentialism. Christian existentialist Gabriel Marcel wrote that it was of \"incontestable\" importance and ranked among the most important contributions made to general philosophy. While Marcel noted the influence of Heidegger on \"the form at least\" of Being and Nothingness, he also observed that Sartre diverged from the views expressed by Heidegger in Being and Time (1927) in important ways, and that Sartre's contributions were original. Marcel considered Sartre's analysis of bad faith \"one of the most outstanding and solid\" parts of Being and Nothingness, writing that it prevented Sartre's arguments from being purely abstract. Marcel saw one of the most important merits of the work to be to show \"that a form of metaphysics which denies or refuses grace inevitably ends by setting up in front of us the image of an atrophied and contradictory world where the better part of ourselves is finally unable to recognise itself\".\nThe philosopher Jean Wahl criticized Sartre's arguments about the topic of \"nothing\". The philosopher Frederick Copleston described Sartre's view that all human actions are the result of free choice as \"highly implausible\", though he noted that Sartre had ways of defending his position. He also expressed sympathy for Marcel's criticism of Sartre, and described Sartre's view of freedom as both \"nihilistic\" and possibly inconsistent with some of Sartre's other views. The philosopher A. J. Ayer wrote that, apart from some psychological insights, the book was \"a pretentious metaphysical thesis\" and \"principally an exercise in misusing the verb 'to be'\".\nThe author Susan Sontag praised Sartre's discussions of the body and concrete relations with others. She identified them as part of a French tradition of serious thought about problems of fundamental importance. The literary scholar John B. Vickery wrote that Being and Nothingness resembles Sir James George Frazer's The Golden Bough (1890) in the way its author \"merges psychology and the concrete sense of fiction\", although he considered it less readable than Frazer's work. The philosopher Iris Murdoch compared Being and Nothingness to Gilbert Ryle's The Concept of Mind (1949). She maintained that continental philosophy shares the same general orientation as English analytic philosophy. According to the philosopher Steven Crowell, Being and Nothingness had come to be seen as outdated by Sartre's death in 1980, since its emphasis on consciousness associated with \"the subjectivism and psychologism that structuralism and analytic philosophy had finally laid to rest\".\nThe philosopher David Pears criticized Sartre's critique of Freud, describing it as complex but imprecisely formulated and open to potential objections. The philosopher Thomas Baldwin described Being and Nothingness as a work of pessimism. He wrote that Sartre's argument that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of Freud, and that Sartre's attempts to adapt Freud's ideas are of greater interest. The director Richard Eyre recalled that Being and Nothingness was popular among British students in the 1960s, but suggests that among them the work usually went unread.\nSeveral authors, including the sociologist Murray S, Davis, the philosophers Roger Scruton and Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, and the physician Frank Gonzalez-Crussi, have praised Sartre for his contributions to the philosophy of sex. Davis credited Sartre with being the first author to present a phenomenological analysis of sex. Scruton credited Sartre with providing \"perhaps the most acute philosophical analysis\" of sexual desire and correctly arguing that treating sexual desire as equivalent to appetite ignores \"the interpersonal component of human sexual responses.\" He described Sartre's reflections on le visqueux as \"celebrated\". He has also credited Sartre with providing a \"stunning apology for sado-masochism\", and characterized Being and Nothingness as a \"great work of post-Christian theology\". Gonzalez-Crussi credited Sartre with recognizing that it is incorrect to equate sexual desire with desire for sexual acts. Sheets-Johnstone believed Sartre presented a subtle analysis of human sexuality. She praised his understanding of desire in general and suggested that his views about the subject anticipated those of the philosopher Michel Foucault. She believed that his views contained both significant truth and internal contradictions. She suggested that despite his criticism of Freud, his views about women and female sexuality were in some ways similar to Freud's. Naomi Greene, arguing that there is a \"distaste for sexuality\" in Sartre's work, identifies a clear \"anti-sexual bias\" present in Being and Nothingness.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCritique of Dialectical Reason\nExistentialism is a Humanism\nPhenomenology of Perception\nSearch for a Method\nThe Imaginary\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBeing and nothingness: an essay in phenomenological ontology, By Jean-Paul Sartre, Citadel Press, 2001\nClass Lecture Notes on Sartre's Being and Nothingness by Professor Spade at Indiana University.\nDr. Bob Zunjic : Sartre's Being and Nothingness (Outline)\nhttps://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/sartres-being-and-nothingness-9780826474698/by Sebastian Gardner at UCL",

    "full_narrative": "Walden (; first published as Walden; or, Life in the Woods) is an 1854 book by American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau. The text is a reflection upon the author's simple living in natural surroundings. The work is part personal declaration of independence, social experiment, voyage of spiritual discovery, satire, and—to some degree—a manual for self-reliance.\nWalden details Thoreau's experiences over the course of two years, two months, and two days in a cabin he built near Walden Pond amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, near Concord, Massachusetts.\nThoreau makes precise scientific observations of nature as well as metaphorical and poetic uses of natural phenomena. He identifies many plants and animals by both their popular and scientific names, records in detail the color and clarity of different bodies of water, precisely dates and describes the freezing and thawing of the pond, and recounts his experiments to measure the depth and shape of the bottom of the supposedly \"bottomless\" Walden Pond.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThere has been much speculation as to why Thoreau went to live at the pond in the first place. E. B. White stated on this note, \"Henry went forth to battle when he took to the woods, and Walden is the report of a man torn by two powerful and opposing drives—the desire to enjoy the world and the urge to set the world straight\", while Leo Marx noted that Thoreau's stay at Walden Pond was an experiment based on his teacher Emerson's \"method and of nature\" and that it was a \"report of an experiment in transcendental pastoralism\".\nOthers have assumed Thoreau's intention during his time at Walden Pond was \"to conduct an experiment: Could he survive, possibly even thrive, by stripping away all superfluous luxuries, living a plain, simple life in radically reduced conditions?\" He thought of it as an experiment in \"home economics\". Although Thoreau went to Walden to escape what he considered \"over-civilization\", and in search of the \"raw\" and \"savage delight\" of the wilderness, he also spent considerable amounts of his time reading and writing.\nThoreau used his time at Walden Pond (July 4, 1845 – September 6, 1847) to write his first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849). The experience later inspired Walden, in which Thoreau compresses the time into a single calendar year and uses passages of four seasons to symbolize human development.\nBy immersing himself in nature, Thoreau hoped to gain a more objective understanding of society through introspection. Simple living and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's other goals. The whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy, a central theme of the American Romantic Period.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.\nPart memoir and part spiritual quest, Walden opens with the announcement that Thoreau spent two years at Walden Pond living a simple life without support of any kind. Readers are reminded that at the time of publication, Thoreau has returned to living among the civilized. The book is separated into several chapters, each of which focuses on specific themes:\nEconomy: In this first and longest chapter, Thoreau outlines his project: a two-year, two-month, and two-day stay at a cozy, \"tightly shingled and plastered\", English-style 10 by 15 foot cottage in the woods near Walden Pond. He does this, he says, to illustrate the spiritual benefits of a simplified lifestyle. He easily supplies the four necessities of life (food, shelter, clothing, and fuel) with the help of family and friends, particularly his mother, his best friend, and Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Waldo Emerson. The latter provided Thoreau with a work exchange: he could build a small house and plant a garden if he cleared some land on the woodlot and did other chores while there. Thoreau meticulously records his expenditures and earnings, demonstrating his understanding of \"economy\", as he builds his house and buys and grows food.\n\nThe house's cost is US$28.12 (equivalent to $948.95 in 2024) and Thoreau gives \"the details because very few are able to tell exactly what their houses cost and fewer still, if any, the separate cost of the various materials which compose them\":\n\nWhere I Lived, and What I Lived For: Thoreau recollects thoughts of places he stayed at before selecting Walden Pond, and quotes Roman philosopher Cato's advice \"consider buying a farm very carefully before signing the papers\".  His possibilities included a nearby Hollowell farm (where the \"wife\" unexpectedly decided she wanted to keep the farm). Thoreau takes to the woods dreaming of an existence free of obligations and full of leisure. He announces that he resides far from social relationships that mail represents (post office) and the majority of the chapter focuses on his thoughts while constructing and living in his new home at Walden.\nReading: Thoreau discusses the benefits of classical literature, preferably in the original Greek or Latin, and bemoans the lack of sophistication in Concord evident in the popularity of unsophisticated literature. He also loved to read books by world travelers. He yearns for a time when each New England village will support \"wise men\" to educate and thereby ennoble the population.\nSounds: Thoreau encourages the reader to be \"forever on the alert\" and \"looking always at what is to be seen\".  Although truth can be found in literature, it can also be found in nature. In addition to self-development, developing one's perception can also alleviate boredom. Rather than \"look[ing] abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre\", Thoreau's own life, including supposedly dull pastimes like housework, becomes a source of amusement that \"never ceases to be novel\".  Likewise, he obtains pleasure in the sounds that fill his cabin: church bells ringing, carriages rattling and rumbling, cows lowing, whip-poor-wills singing, owls hooting, frogs croaking, and cockerels crowing. \"All sound heard at the greatest possible distance,\" he contends \"produces one and the same effect\".\nSolitude: Thoreau reflects on the feeling of solitude. He explains how loneliness can occur even amongst companions if one's heart is not open to them. Thoreau meditates on the pleasures of escaping society and the petty things that society entails (gossip, fights, etc.). He also reflects on his new companion, an old settler who arrives nearby and an old woman with great memory (\"memory runs back farther than mythology\"). Thoreau repeatedly reflects on the benefits of nature and of his deep communion with it and states that the only \"medicine he needs is a draught of morning air\".\nVisitors: Thoreau talks about how he enjoys companionship (despite his love for solitude) and always leaves three chairs ready for visitors. The entire chapter focuses on the coming and going of visitors, and how he has more comers in Walden than he did in the city. He receives visits from those living or working nearby and gives special attention to a French Canadian born woodsman named Alec Thérien. Unlike Thoreau, Thérien cannot read or write and is described as leading an \"animal life\". He compares Thérien to Walden Pond itself. Thoreau then reflects on the women and children who seem to enjoy the pond more than men, and how men are limited because their lives are taken up.\nThe Bean-Field: Reflection on Thoreau's planting and his enjoyment of this new job/hobby. He touches upon the joys of his environment, the sights and sounds of nature, but also on the military sounds nearby. The rest of the chapter focuses on his earnings and his cultivation of crops (including how he spends just under fifteen dollars on this).\nThe Village: The chapter focuses on Thoreau's reflections on the journeys he takes several times a week to Concord, where he gathers the latest gossip and meets with townsmen. On one of his journeys into Concord, Thoreau is detained and jailed for his refusal to pay a poll tax to the \"state that buys and sells men, women, and children, like cattle at the door of its senate-house\".\n\nThe Ponds: In autumn, Thoreau discusses the countryside and writes down his observations about the geography of Walden Pond and its neighbors: Flint's Pond (or Sandy Pond), White Pond, and Goose Pond. Although Flint's Pond is the largest, Thoreau's favorites are Walden and White ponds, which he describes as lovelier than diamonds.\nBaker Farm: While on an afternoon ramble in the woods, Thoreau gets caught in a rainstorm and takes shelter in the dirty, dismal hut of John Field, a penniless but hard-working Irish farmhand, and his wife and children. Thoreau urges Field to live a simple yet independent and fulfilling life in the woods, thereby freeing himself of employers and creditors. However, the Irishman will not give up his aspirations of luxury and the quest for the American dream.\nHigher Laws: Thoreau discusses whether hunting wild animals and eating meat is necessary. He concludes that the primitive, carnal sensuality of humans drives them to kill and eat animals, and that a person who transcends this propensity is superior to those who cannot. (Thoreau eats fish and occasionally salt pork and woodchuck.) In addition to vegetarianism, he lauds chastity, work, and teetotalism. He also recognizes that Native Americans need to hunt and kill moose for survival in \"The Maine Woods\", and eats moose on a trip to Maine while he was living at Walden. Here is a list of the laws that he mentions:\n\nOne must love that of the wild just as much as one loves that of the good.\nWhat men already know instinctively is true humanity.\nThe hunter is the greatest friend of the animal which is hunted.\nNo human older than an adolescent would wantonly murder any creature which reveres its own life as much as the killer.\nIf the day and the night make one joyful, one is successful.\nThe highest form of self-restraint is when one can subsist not on other animals, but of plants and crops cultivated from the earth.\nBrute Neighbors: This chapter is a simplified version of one of Thoreau's conversations with William Ellery Channing, who sometimes accompanied Thoreau on fishing trips when Channing had come up from Concord. The conversation is about a hermit (Thoreau) and a poet (Channing) and how the poet is absorbed in the clouds while the hermit is occupied with the more practical task of getting fish for dinner and how in the end, the poet regrets his failure to catch fish. The chapter also mentions Thoreau's interaction with a mouse that he lives with, a scene in which an ant battles a smaller ant, and his frequent encounters with cats.\nHouse-Warming: After picking November berries in the woods, Thoreau adds a chimney, and finally plasters the walls of his sturdy house to stave off the cold of the oncoming winter. He also lays in a good supply of firewood and expresses affection for wood and fire.\nFormer Inhabitants; and Winter Visitors: Thoreau tells the stories of people who formerly lived in the vicinity of Walden Pond. Then, he talks about a few of the visitors he receives during the winter: a farmer, a woodchopper, and his best friend, the poet Ellery Channing.\nWinter Animals: Thoreau amuses himself by watching wildlife during the winter. He relates his observations of owls, hares, red squirrels, mice, and various birds as they hunt, sing, and eat the scraps and corn he put out for them. He also describes a fox hunt that passes by.\nThe Pond in Winter: Thoreau describes Walden Pond as it appears during the winter. He says he has sounded its depths and located an underground outlet. Then, he recounts how 100 laborers came to cut great blocks of ice from the pond to be shipped to the Carolinas.\nSpring: As spring arrives, Walden and the other ponds melt with powerful thundering and rumbling. Thoreau enjoys watching the thaw, and grows ecstatic as he witnesses the green rebirth of nature. He watches the geese winging their way north, and a hawk playing by itself in the sky. As nature is reborn, the narrator implies, so is he.\nConclusion: In the final chapter, Thoreau criticizes conformity: \"If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\" By doing so, men may find happiness and self-fulfillment.\n\nI do not say that John or Jonathan will realize all this; but such is the character of that morrow which mere lapse of time can never make to dawn. The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.\n\n\n== Themes ==\n\nWalden is a difficult book to read for three reasons: First, it was written in an older prose, which uses surgically precise language, extended, allegorical metaphors, long and complex paragraphs and sentences, and vivid, detailed, and insightful descriptions. Thoreau does not hesitate to use metaphors, allusions, understatement, hyperbole, personification, irony, satire, metonymy, synecdoche, and oxymorons, and he can shift from a scientific to a transcendental point of view in mid-sentence. Second, its logic is based on a different understanding of life, quite contrary to what most people would call common sense. Ironically, this logic is based on what most people say they believe. Thoreau, recognizing this, fills Walden with sarcasm, paradoxes, and double entendres. He likes to tease, challenge, and even fool his readers. And third, quite often any words would be inadequate at expressing many of Thoreau's non-verbal insights into truth. Thoreau must use non-literal language to express these notions, and the reader must reach out to understand.\nWalden emphasizes the importance of solitude, contemplation, and closeness to nature in transcending the \"desperate\" existence that, he argues, is the lot of most people. The book is not a traditional autobiography, but combines autobiography with a social critique of contemporary Western culture's consumerist and materialist attitudes and its distance from and destruction of nature. Thoreau's proximity to Concord society and his admiration for classical literature suggest that the book is not simply a criticism of society, but also an attempt to engage creatively with the better aspects of contemporary culture. There are signs of ambiguity, or an attempt to see an alternative side of something common. Some of the major themes that are present within the text are:\n\nSelf-reliance: Thoreau constantly refuses to be in \"need\" of the companionship of others. Though he realizes its significance and importance, he thinks it unnecessary to always be in search for it. Self-reliance, to him, is economic and social and is a principle that in terms of financial and interpersonal relations is more valuable than anything. To Thoreau, self-reliance can be both spiritual as well as economic. Self-reliance was a key tenet of transcendentalism, famously expressed in Emerson's essay \"Self-Reliance\".\nSimplicity: Simplicity seems to be Thoreau's model for life. Throughout the book, Thoreau constantly seeks to simplify his lifestyle: he patches his clothes rather than buy new ones, he minimizes his consumer activity, and relies on leisure time and on himself for everything.\nProgress: In a world where everyone and everything is eager to advance in terms of progress, Thoreau finds it stubborn and skeptical to think that any outward improvement of life can bring inner peace and contentment.\nThe need for spiritual awakening: Spiritual awakening is the way to find and realize the truths of life which are often buried under the mounds of daily affairs. Thoreau holds the spiritual awakening to be a quintessential component of life. It is the source from which all of the other themes flow.\nMan as part of nature\nNature and its reflection of human emotions\nThe state as unjust and corrupt\nMeditation: Thoreau was an avid meditator and often spoke about the benefits of meditating.\nPatience: Thoreau realizes that the methods he tries to employ at Walden Pond will not be instituted in the near future. He does not like compromise, so he must wait for change to occur. He does not go into isolation in the woods of Massachusetts for over two years for his own benefit. Thoreau wants to transform the world around him, but understands that it will take time.\n\n\n== Style and analysis ==\nWalden has been the subject of many scholarly articles. Book reviewers, critics, scholars, and many more have published literature on Thoreau's Walden.\nThoreau carefully recounts his time in the woods through his writing in Walden. Critics have thoroughly analyzed the different writing styles that Thoreau uses. Critic Nicholas Bagnall writes that Thoreau's observations of nature are \"lyrical\" and \"exact\". Another critic, Henry Golemba, asserts that the writing style of Walden is very natural. Thoreau employs various styles of writing where his words are both intricate and simple at the same time. His word choice conveys a certain mood. For instance, when Thoreau describes the silence of nature, the reader may feel that serene moment as well. Thoreau continues to connect back to nature throughout the book because he wants to depict what he experienced and saw.\nMany scholars have compared Thoreau to fellow transcendentalist writer Ralph Waldo Emerson. Although Emerson was 14 years his senior, much of Thoreau's writing was influenced by Emerson. Critic John Brooks Moore examined the relationship between Thoreau and Emerson and the effects it had on their respective works. Moore claims that Thoreau did not simply mimic Emerson's work, but he was actually the more dominant one in the relationship. Thoreau has learned from Emerson and some \"Emersonism\" can be found in his works, but Thoreau's work is distinct from Emerson's. Many critics have also seen the influence of Thomas Carlyle (a great influence on Emerson), particularly in Thoreau's use of an extended clothing metaphor, which Carlyle had used in Sartor Resartus (1831).\nScholars have recognized Walden's use of biblical allusions. Such allusions are useful tools to convince readers because the Bible is seen as a principal book of truth. According to scholar Judith Saunders, the signature biblical allusion identified in the book is, \"Walden was dead and is alive again.\" This is almost verbatim from Luke 15.11–32. Thoreau is personifying Walden Pond to further the story relevant to the Bible. He compares the process of death and rebirth of the pond to self-transformation in humans.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nWalden enjoyed some success upon its release, but still took five years to sell 2,000 copies, and then went out of print until Thoreau's death in 1862. Despite its slow beginnings, later critics have praised it as an American classic that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty. The American poet, Robert Frost, wrote of Thoreau, \"In one book ... he surpasses everything we have had in America\".\nIt is often assumed that critics initially ignored Walden, and that those who reviewed the book were evenly split or slightly more negative than positive in their assessment of it. But, researchers have shown that Walden actually was \"more favorably and widely received by Thoreau's contemporaries than hitherto suspected\". Of the 66 initial reviews that have been found so far, 46 \"were strongly favorable\". Some reviews were rather superficial, merely recommending the book or predicting its success with the public; others were more lengthy, detailed, and nuanced with both positive and negative comments. Positive comments included praise for Thoreau's independence, practicality, wisdom, \"manly simplicity\", and fearlessness. Less than three weeks after the book's publication, Thoreau's mentor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, proclaimed, \"All American kind are delighted with Walden as far as they have dared to say.\"\nOn the other hand, the terms \"quaint\" or \"eccentric\" appeared in over half of the book's initial reviews. Other terms critical of Thoreau included selfish, strange, impractical, privileged (or \"manor born\"), and misanthropic. One review compared and contrasted Thoreau's form of living to communism, probably not in the sense of Marxism, but instead of communal living or religious communism. While valuing freedom from possessions, Thoreau was not communal in the sense of practicing sharing or of embracing community. So, communism \"is better than our hermit's method of getting rid of encumbrance\".\nIn contrast to Thoreau's \"manly simplicity\", nearly twenty years after Thoreau's death Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone in natural simplicity, apart from modern society, to be a mark of effeminacy, calling it \"womanish solicitude; for there is something unmanly, something almost dastardly\" about the lifestyle. Poet John Greenleaf Whittier criticized what he perceived as the message in Walden that man should lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs. He said: \"Thoreau's Walden is a capital reading, but very wicked and heathenish ... After all, for me, I prefer walking on two legs\". Author Edward Abbey criticized Thoreau's ideas and experiences at Walden in detail throughout his response to Walden called \"Down the River with Thoreau\", written in 1980.\nToday, despite these criticisms, Walden stands as one of America's most celebrated works of literature. John Updike wrote of Walden, \"A century and a half after its publication, Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible.\" The American psychologist B. F. Skinner wrote that he carried a copy of Walden with him in his youth, and eventually wrote Walden Two in 1945, a fictional utopia about 1,000 members who live together in a Thoreau-inspired community.\nKathryn Schulz has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy and being sanctimonious based on his writings in Walden, although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nThe National Endowment for the Arts in 2012 bestowed Tracy Fullerton, game designer and professor at the University of Southern California's Game Innovation Lab, with a $40,000 grant to create, based on the book, a first person, open world video game called Walden, a game,  in which players \"inhabit an open, three-dimensional game world that will simulate the geography and environment of Walden Woods\". The game production was also supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and was part of the Sundance New Frontier Story Lab in 2014. The game was released to critical acclaim on July 4, 2017, celebrating both the day that Thoreau went down to the pond to begin his experiment and the 200th anniversary of Thoreau's birth.  It was nominated for the Off-Broadway Award for Best Indie Game at the New York Game Awards 2018.\n\n\n=== Digitization and scholarship efforts ===\nDigital Thoreau,  a collaboration among the State University of New York at Geneseo, the Thoreau Society, and the Walden Woods Project, has developed a fluid text edition of Walden across the different versions of the work to help readers trace the evolution of Thoreau's classic work across seven stages of revision from 1846 to 1854.  Within any chapter of Walden, readers can compare up to seven manuscript versions with each other, with the Princeton University Press edition, and consult critical notes drawn from Thoreau scholars, including Ronald Clapper's dissertation The Development of Walden: A Genetic Text (1967) and Walter Harding's Walden: An Annotated Edition (1995). Ultimately, the project will provide a space for readers to discuss Thoreau in the margins of his texts.\n\n\n=== Influence ===\n\nThe Dutch writer and psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden used the ideas from this book to create his own vision, back to the nature, at the commune Walden in the Netherlands in 1898.\nIn the 1948 book Walden Two by behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner the experimental Walden Two Community is mentioned as having the benefits of living in a place like Thoreau's Walden, but \"with company\".\nJonas Mekas' 1968 film Walden is loosely inspired by the book.\nThe film All That Heaven Allows (1955) is clearly influenced by Thoreau, with the protagonist Cary Scott (Jane Wyman) reading lines from Walden.  \nJean Craighead George's My Side of the Mountain trilogy (1959) draws heavily from themes expressed in Walden.

She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law. She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.\nConrad Grebel and Anabaptists advocated civil disobedience to oppression. Étienne de La Boétie's thought developed in his work Discours de la servitude volontaire ou le Contr'un (1552) was also taken up by many movements of civil disobedience, which drew from the concept of rebellion to voluntary servitude the foundation of its instrument of struggle. Étienne de La Boétie was one of the first to theorize and propose the strategy of non-cooperation, and thus a form of nonviolent disobedience, as a really effective weapon.\nIn the lead-up to the Glorious Revolution in Britain—when the 1689 Bill of Rights was documented, the last Catholic monarch was deposed, and male and female joint-co-monarchs elevated—the English Midland Enlightenment developed a manner of voicing objection to a law viewed as illegitimate and then taking the consequences of the law. (For example, they might refuse to swear allegiance to the king, and, as a consequence, accept the prison sentence legally and normally meted out to people who refused to take this oath.) This was focused on the illegitimacy of laws claimed to be \"divine\" in origin, both the \"divine rights of kings\" and \"divine rights of man\", and the legitimacy of laws acknowledged to be made by human beings.\nFollowing the Peterloo massacre of 1819, the poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action. According to Ashton Nichols, it is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience, and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha. Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action. In particular, it is known that Gandhi often quoted Shelley's Mask of Anarchy to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.\nThoreau's 1849 essay Civil Disobedience, originally titled \"Resistance to Civil Government\", has had a wide influence on many later practitioners of civil disobedience. The driving idea behind the essay is that citizens are morally responsible for their support of aggressors, even when such support is required by law. In the essay, Thoreau explained his reasons for having refused to pay taxes as an act of protest against slavery and against the Mexican–American War. He writes,\n\nIf I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, \"I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico;—see if I would go;\" and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute.\nBy the 1850s, a range of minority groups in the United States: African Americans, Jews, Seventh Day Baptists, Catholics, anti-prohibitionists, racial egalitarians, and others—employed civil disobedience to combat a range of legal measures and public practices that to them promoted ethnic, religious, and racial discrimination. Pro Public and typically peaceful resistance to political power remained an integral tactic in modern American minority rights politics.\nIn Ireland starting from 1879 the Irish \"Land War\" intensified when Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell, in a speech in Ennis proposed that when dealing with tenants who take farms where another tenant was evicted, rather than resorting to violence, everyone in the locality should shun them. Following this Captain Charles Boycott, the land agent of an absentee landlord in County Mayo, Ireland, was subject to social ostracism organized by the Irish Land League in 1880. Boycott attempted to evict eleven tenants from his land. While Parnell's speech did not refer to land agents or landlords, the tactic was applied to Boycott when the alarm was raised about the evictions. Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolated – his workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as in his house. Local businessmen stopped trading with him, and the local postman refused to deliver mail. The movement spread throughout Ireland and gave rise to the term to Boycott, and eventually led to legal reform and support for Irish independence.\nEgypt saw a massive implementation on a nation-wide movement starting 1914 and peaking in 1919 as the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. This was then adopted by other peoples who campaigned against European colonial rule from 1920 onwards. Zaghloul Pasha, considered the mastermind behind this massive civil disobedience, was a native middle-class, Azhar graduate, political activist, judge, parliamentary and ex-cabinet minister whose leadership brought Christian and Muslim communities together as well as women into the massive protests. Along with his companions of Wafd Party, who have achieved an independence of Egypt and a first constitution in 1923.\nCivil disobedience is one of the many ways people have revolted against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India (Mahatma Gandhi's campaigns for independence from the British Empire), in Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, in early stages of the Bangladeshi independence movement against Pakistani colonialism and in East Germany to oust their Stalinist government. In South Africa during the leftist campaign against the far-right Apartheid regime, in the American civil rights movement against Jim Crow laws, in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union, and more recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2013–2014 Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine, the 2016–2017 Candlelight Revolution in South Korea, and the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests, among many other various movements worldwide.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nHenry David Thoreau's 1849 essay \"Resistance to Civil Government\" was eventually renamed \"Essay on Civil Disobedience\". After his landmark lectures were published in 1866, the term began to appear in numerous sermons and lectures relating to slavery and the war in Mexico. Thus, by the time Thoreau's lectures were first published under the title \"Civil Disobedience\", in 1866, four years after his death, the term had achieved fairly widespread usage.\nIt has been argued that the term \"civil disobedience\" has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased. Marshall Cohen notes, \"It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official. Indeed, for Vice President Spiro Agnew it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins.\"\nLeGrande writes that\n\nthe formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult, if not impossible. In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject, the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties. Like Alice in Wonderland, he often finds that specific terminology has no more (or no less) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have.\nHe encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience.\nIn a letter to P. K. Rao, dated 10 September 1935, Gandhi disputes that his idea of civil disobedience was derived from the writings of Thoreau:\n\nThe statement that I had derived my idea of Civil Disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong. The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay ... When I saw the title of Thoreau's great essay, I began to use his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers. But I found that even \"Civil Disobedience\" failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase \"Civil Resistance.\"\n\n\n== Theories ==\nIn seeking an active form of civil disobedience, one may choose to deliberately break certain laws, such as by forming a peaceful blockade or occupying a facility illegally, though sometimes violence has been known to occur. Often there is an expectation to be attacked or even beaten by the authorities. Protesters often undergo training in advance on how to react to arrest or to attack.\nCivil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional impasse, in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, conflict. For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would act in his or her capacity as public official rather than private citizen.\nThis definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy on the conscience vs. the collective. The person is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only people act, only a person can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is a person in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau's imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, \"Resign\". If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. He admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is \"liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it\". If a government did express the voice of most people, this would not compel the obedience of those who disagree with what is said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right.\nIn his 1971 book, A Theory of Justice, John Rawls described civil disobedience as \"a public, non-violent, conscientious yet political act contrary to law usually done with the aim of bringing about change in the law or policies of the government\".\nRonald Dworkin held that there are three types of civil disobedience:\n\n\"Integrity-based\" civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys a law they feel is immoral, as in the case of abolitionists disobeying the fugitive slave laws by refusing to turn over escaped slaves to authorities.\n\"Justice-based\" civil disobedience occurs when a citizen disobeys laws to lay claim to some right denied to them, as when Black people illegally protested during the civil rights movement.\n\"Policy-based\" civil disobedience occurs when a person breaks the law to change a policy they believe is dangerously wrong.\nSome theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects \"a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken\". The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments.\nIt is usually recognized that lawbreaking, if it is not done publicly, at least must be publicly announced to constitute civil disobedience. But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing their natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations. The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication \"A Primer for Prospective Jurors\" notes, \"Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.\" By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it. (Exodus 1: 15–19)\n\n\n=== Violent vs. nonviolent ===\nThere have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. Black's Law Dictionary includes nonviolence in its definition of civil disobedience. Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires \"carefully chosen and legitimate means\", but holds that they do not have to be non-violent. It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedient's use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest. Civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.\nThe philosopher H. J. McCloskey argues that \"if violent, intimidatory, coercive disobedience is more effective, it is, other things being equal, more justified than less effective, nonviolent disobedience.\" In his best-selling Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order, Howard Zinn takes a similar position; Zinn states that while the goals of civil disobedience are generally nonviolent,\n\nin the inevitable tension accompanying the transition from a violent world to a non-violent one, the choice of means will almost never be pure, and will involve such complexities that the simple distinction between violence and non-violence does not suffice as a guide ... the very acts with which we seek to do good cannot escape the imperfections of the world we are trying to change.\nZinn rejects any \"easy and righteous dismissal of violence\", noting that Thoreau, the popularizer of the term civil disobedience, approved of the armed insurrection of John Brown. He also notes that some major civil disobedience campaigns which have been classified as non-violent, such as the Birmingham campaign, have actually included elements of violence.\n\n\n=== Revolutionary vs. non-revolutionary ===\nNon-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged \"wrong\" by a person's conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue. Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs or religious beliefs). Revolution does not have to be political, i.e. \"cultural revolution\", it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric. Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience. It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc Deák directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government. Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing \"peaceable revolution\". Howard Zinn, Harvey Wheeler, and others have identified the right espoused in the US Declaration of Independence to \"alter or abolish\" an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience.\n\n\n=== Collective vs. solitary ===\nThe earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the Roman Empire. Unarmed Jews gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem. In modern times, some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met, such as favourable bail conditions, or the release of all the activists. This is a form of jail solidarity. There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience, such as that committed by Thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed. Thoreau, at the time of his arrest, was not yet a well-known author, and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened. The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office, and Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.\n\n\n== Choices ==\n\n\n=== Action ===\nCivil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Hugo A. Bedau writes,\n\nThere is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation) ... Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane ... The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.\nBedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the US government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law. Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna, a 180-foot (55 m)-tall, 600-year-old California Redwood tree for 738 days, preventing its felling.\nIn cases where the criminalized behaviour is pure speech, civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech. An example is WBAI's broadcasting of the bit \"Filthy Words\" from a George Carlin comedy album, which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation. Threatening government officials is a way to express defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies. For example, a supporter of some tax deniers in New Hampshire, Edward and Elaine Brown, was arrested for allegedly telling the local city councillors to \"Wise up or die.\"\nMore generally, protesters of particular victimless crimes often see fit to openly commit that crime. Laws against public nudity, for instance, have been protested by going naked in public, and laws against cannabis consumption have been protested by openly possessing it and using it at cannabis rallies.\nSome forms of civil disobedience, such as illegal boycotts, refusals to pay taxes, draft dodging, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and sit-ins, make it more difficult for a system to function. In this way, they might be considered coercive; coercive disobedience has the effect of exposing the enforcement of laws and policies, and it has even operated as an aesthetic strategy in contemporary art practice. Brownlee notes that \"although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue, nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion to get their issue onto the table\". The Plowshares organization temporarily closed GCSB Waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes.\nElectronic civil disobedience can include web site defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft and data leaks, illegal web site parodies, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage. It is distinct from other kinds of hacktivism in that the perpetrator openly reveals his identity. Virtual actions rarely succeed in completely shutting down their targets, but they often generate media attention.\nDilemma actions are designed to create a \"response dilemma\" for public authorities \"by forcing them to either concede some public space to protesters or make themselves look absurd or heavy-handed by acting against the protest.\"\n\n\n=== Response to punishment ===\nAs civil disobedience is intentionally breaking the law, people engaging in civil disobedience can expect to be arrested, criminally charged, tried, and legally punished for breaking the law. Protestors have to make choices about how to respond to each of these results.  \nAl Sharpton, a civil rights and social justice activist, says that civil disobedients \"must be prepared to say the cause is more important than my freedom\" and not incorrectly believe themselves to have legal immunity or feel a sense of entitlement to break laws without being subject to the ordinary legal punishments for breaking those laws.  \n\n\n==== Arrest strategies ====\n\nSome disciplines of civil disobedience hold that the protester must submit to arrest and cooperate with the authorities. Others advocate falling limp or resisting arrest, especially when it will hinder the police from effectively responding to a mass protest.\nMany of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether to grant a consent search of his property and whether to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose and may be harmful. Some civil disobedients are compelled to respond to investigators' questions, sometimes by a misunderstanding of the legal ramifications or a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote,\n\nMy civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very man I have to deal with—for it is, after all, with men and not with parchment that I quarrel—and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government. How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has respect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and disturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.\n\n\n==== Trial strategies ====\nSome civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract, which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established, or else suffer the penalties set out in the law. Other civil disobedients who favour the existence of government still do not believe in the legitimacy of their particular government or do not believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted. Anarchistic civil disobedients do not believe in the legitimacy of any government, so see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law.\n\n\n===== Pleading guilty =====\nAn important decision for civil disobedients is whether to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged\", but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I, therefore, plead not guilty.\" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, \"I plead for the beauty that surrounds us\"; this is known as a \"creative plea\", and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.\nWhen the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest. At an announced time, one by one they crossed a line and were immediately arrested. They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon. A civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the accused, advising them to plead nolo contendere rather than guilty or not guilty. They were found guilty and given suspended sentences, conditional on not reentering the test site.\nHoward Zinn writes,\n\nThere may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to \"the rules\" is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest ... In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.\nSometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients, as in the case of the Camden 28, in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanour count and receive no jail time. In some mass arrest situations, the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone. \nBut some activists have opted to enter a blind plea, pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place. Mahatma Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court, \"I am here to ... submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.\"\n\n\n===== Allocution =====\nSome civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in allocution. In U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar, a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on US Navy property argued to the court in allocution that \"the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy\". As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions. Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.\nTim DeChristopher gave an allocution statement to the court describing the US as \"a place where the rule of law was created through acts of civil disobedience\" and arguing, \"Since those bedrock acts of civil disobedience by our founding fathers, the rule of law in this country has continued to grow closer to our shared higher moral code through the civil disobedience that drew attention to legalized injustice.\"\n\n\n===== Trial strategies =====\nSteven Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty, \"they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience.\" A technical defence may enhance the chances for acquittal but increase the possibility of additional proceedings and of reduced press coverage. During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defence, but Benjamin Spock used a technical defence. In countries such as the United States, whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v. United States, which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and United States v. Dougherty, which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.\n\n\n==== Choices made by the legal system ====\nBritish judge Lord Hoffman writes that \"In deciding whether or not to impose punishment, the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good. This means that the objector has no right not to be punished. It is a matter for the state (including the judges) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not.\" Hoffman also asserted that while the \"rules of the game\" for civil disobedients were to remain non-violent while breaking the law, the authorities must recognize that demonstrators are acting out of their conscience in pursuit of democracy. \"When it comes to punishment, the court should take into account their personal convictions\", he said.\n\n\n=== Choices made by society ===\nIn addition to legal action, civil disobedients may be affected socially. For example, student protesters may be suspended or expelled from school. Civil disobedients may be disowned by or become estranged from their families. Some employers may prefer to hire people who did not engage in civil disobedience or fire employees who do.  \n\n\n== Legal theory ==\nGovernments have generally not recognized the legitimacy of civil disobedience or viewed political objectives as an excuse for breaking the law. Specifically, the law usually distinguishes between criminal motive and criminal intent; the offender's motives or purposes may be admirable and praiseworthy, but his intent may still be criminal. For example, a protester may be motivated by a desire to increase awareness about an injustice and intend to block traffic on a street, and it is the intention, rather than the motivation, that is criminally significant. Hence the saying that \"if there is any possible justification of civil disobedience, it must come from outside the legal system.\"\nOne theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it undermines the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished. \nCourts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: \"Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.\" \nDuring the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question. The necessity defence has sometimes been used as a shadow defence by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. Court cases such as United States v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defence. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defence, and he was found guilty. Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to the association, many of them have escaped prosecution because \"prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence.\"\nAlong with giving the offender his just deserts, achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment. Brownlee says \"Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law's engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law.\" \n\n\n== Actions that are outside of civil disobedience ==\nMichael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience. \nBreaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience. Likewise, a protester who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally not called a civil disobedient.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

    "full_narrative": "\"Self-Reliance\" is an 1841 essay written by American transcendentalist philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson. It contains the most thorough statement of one of his recurrent themes: the need for each person to avoid conformity and false consistency, and follow his or her own instincts and ideas. It is the source of one of his most famous quotations:\n\n\"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.\"\nThis essay is an analysis into the nature of the \"aboriginal self on which a universal reliance may be grounded\". Emerson emphasizes the importance of individualism and its effect on a person's satisfaction in life, explaining how life is \"learning and forgetting and learning again\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first hint of the philosophy that would become \"Self-Reliance\" was presented by Ralph Waldo Emerson as part of a sermon in September 1830 a month after his first marriage. His wife Ellen was sick with tuberculosis and, as Emerson's biographer Robert D. Richardson wrote, \"Immortality had never been stronger or more desperately needed!\"\nFrom 1836 into 1837, Emerson presented a series of lectures on the philosophy of history at Boston's Masonic Temple. These lectures were never published separately, but many of his thoughts in these were later used in \"Self-Reliance\" and several other essays. Later lectures, such as \"The American Scholar\" and the Divinity School Address,\nby Emerson led to public censure of his radical views, the staunch defense of individualism in \"Self-Reliance\" being a possible reaction to that censure.\n\"Self-Reliance\" was first published in his 1841 collection, Essays: First Series.\nEmerson helped start the beginning of the Transcendentalist movement in America. \"Self-Reliance\" is one of Emerson's most famous essays. Emerson wrote on \"individualism, personal responsibility, and nonconformity.\"\nEmerson had a very large background of religious affiliations. His father was a Unitarian minister; Emerson eventually followed in his father's footsteps to become a minister as well. Emerson's religious practices can be viewed as unconventional and his beliefs, non-traditional. Emerson understood that individuals are inexplicably different and ideas are constantly changing. He encouraged religious individuals to \"breathe new life into the old forms of their religion.\"\nThe Transcendentalist movement flourished in New England and proposed a revolutionarily new philosophy of life. This new philosophy drew upon old ideas of Romanticism, Unitarianism, and German Idealism as well as the American republican tradition. Some of these ideas pertained closely to the values of America at the time. These values included nature, individualism, and reform, and can be noted in Emerson's essay.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nEmerson's themes include the authority of the individual, according to Anne Marie Hacht. Nothing has authority over the self, she says. One particular temptation is to find enlightenment in history but Emerson argues that it can only come from individual searching. He believes that truth is inside a person and this is an authority, not institutions like religion.\nEmerson's essay focuses and consistently relates back to one major theme: \"Trust thyself\".\nOne of the most prevalent themes in the essay is nonconformity. Emerson states,\n\n\"Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist\".\nHe counsels his readers to do what they think is right no matter what others think.\nHaijing Liang, in her analysis of \"Self-Reliance\", explains how Emerson \"encourages the readers to free themselves from the constraints of conformity and give themselves back to their nature\".\nSolitude and the community appear within the essay multiple times. Emerson wrote how the community is a distraction to self-growth, by friendly visits, and family needs. He advocates more time being spent reflecting on one's self. This can also happen in the community through strong self-confidence. This would help the counseled to not sway from his beliefs in groups of people. Emerson mentions \"but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.\"\nSpirituality, specifically the idea that truth is within one's self, is a recurring theme in Emerson's essay. Emerson posits that reliance upon institutionalized religion hinders the ability to grow mentally as an individual.\nThe theme of individualism is often proposed within \"Self-Reliance\".\nEmerson explains the ultimate form of happiness is achieved when a person learns and adapts an individualistic lifestyle based on their own values.\nEmerson emphasizes, \"Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles.\"\nThe conflict between originality and imitation is often an oscillating theme in the essay. Emerson emphasizes that \"Envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide.\" Near the end, he encourages society: \"Insist on yourself; never imitate.\"\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nHerman Melville's 1851 novel Moby-Dick has been read as a critique of Emerson's philosophy of self-reliance, embodied particularly in the life and death of Ahab. Melville's critique of self-reliance as a way of life is seen to lie in its destructive potential, especially when taken to extremes. Richard Chase writes that for Melville,\n\n\"Death – spiritual, emotional, physical – is the price of self-reliance when it is pushed to the point of solipsism, where the world has no existence apart from the all-sufficient self.\"\nIn that regard, Chase sees Melville's art as antithetical to that of Emerson's thought, in that Melville\n\n\"[points] up the dangers of an exaggerated self-regard, rather than, as ... Emerson loved to do, [suggested] the vital possibilities of the self.\"\nNewton Arvin further suggests that self-reliance was, for Melville, really the\n\n\"[masquerade in kingly weeds of] a wild egoism, anarchic, irresponsible, and destructive.\"\nAlthough never directly stated, Emerson's \"Self-Reliance\" has religious influences tied into the values and beliefs presented. Critics argue that Emerson believes the Universe is not complete without \"The Spirit\". Without some form of spirituality or religious tendencies, society and the universe \"is sad, hopeless, and largely meaningless.\"\nIn his work, the transcendentalist argues that no person, specifically individuals who are self-reliant, exists without a slight connection to a higher power. Mark Cladis, author of a published religious analysis of \"Self-Reliance\", argues individuals are\n\n\"intimately connected to that which is greater than the self alone.\"\nEmerson encourages his readers to understand that self-reliance is\n\n\"freedom in a spiritual universe that is just as rule-governed as the Newtonian physical universe\".\nCladis explains that individuals are not expected to endure life alone; achieving self-reliance is understanding that\n\n\"we are surrounded by helps and aids of all kinds, supporting us, sustaining us, journeying always with us.\"\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nEmerson's quote, \"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds\", is a running joke in the 1998 film Next Stop Wonderland. A single woman (portrayed by Hope Davis), who is familiar with the Emerson quote, goes on dates with several men, each of whom tries to impress her by referencing the line, but misquotes it and misattributes it to W.C. Fields, Karl Marx, or Cicero.\nThis quote is also referenced in one of the episodes of the television show The Mentalist when Patrick Jane meets a crime boss and they start a dialogue.\nIt was also stated in the 1989 film Dream a Little Dream in reference to a group of teenagers who regularly take a short cut through the backyard of an older couple, it is used as well in the 1972 comedy film What's Up, Doc?\nIsaac Asimov, in author's notes to his collection of mystery short stories, Asimov's Mysteries, invokes the quote with the single word \"Emerson!\" whenever one story in the collection, set in a common universe, appears to contradict another. For instance, the story \"The Dying Night\" appears to contradict the background of \"The Singing Bell\". Asimov relates how he was introduced to the quotation while reviewing proofs of an article with his co-authors.\n\n\n== References ==\n \n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEmerson, Ralph Waldo (1982) [1841].

    "full_narrative": "A Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf, first published in 1929. Divided into six chapters, the work is based on two lectures Woolf delivered in October 1928 at two women's colleges, Newnham College and Girton College, of the University of Cambridge.\nThe essay discusses a variety of topics and uses many metaphors and thought experiments to illustrate her points, particularly focusing on women's lack of free self-expression. Her metaphor of a fish explains her most essential point, \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". She writes of a woman whose thought had \"let its line down into the stream\". As the woman starts to think of an idea, a guard enforces a rule whereby women are not allowed to walk on the grass. Abiding by the rule, the woman loses her idea.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe essay was based on two papers Woolf read on 20 and 26 October 1928 to two Cambridge student societies, the Newnham Arts Society at Newnham College and the ODTAA Society (\"One Damn Thing After Another\") at Girton College, respectively. Elsie Duncan-Jones, then known as Elsie Phare, was the president of the Newnham Arts Society at the time and wrote an account of the paper, \"Women and Fiction\", for the college magazine, Thersites. Woolf stayed at Newnham at the invitation of Pernel Strachey, the college principal, whose family were key members of the Bloomsbury Group. At Girton she was accompanied by Vita Sackville-West. It was published in 1929 as a book with six chapters.\nOn 1 January 2025, A Room of One's Own entered the public domain in the United States.\n\n\n== Themes ==\n\n\n=== The Four Marys ===\nThe title of the essay comes from Woolf's conception that \"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". The narrator of the work is referred to early on: \"Here then was I (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please—it is not a matter of any importance)\". The two Marys were ladies-in-waiting to Mary, Queen of Scots; they – along with Mary Carmichael – are also characters in a 16th-century Scottish ballad, Mary Hamilton, about a lady-in-waiting who is facing execution for having had a child with the King, a child she killed.\n\n\n=== Women's access to education ===\n\nThe essay examines whether women were capable of producing, and in fact free to produce, work of the quality of William Shakespeare, addressing the limitations that past and present women writers face.\nWoolf's father, Sir Leslie Stephen, in line with the thinking of the era, believed that only the boys of the family should be sent to school. In delivering the lectures outlined in the essay, Woolf is speaking to women who have the opportunity to learn in a formal setting. She moves her audience to understand the importance of their education, while warning them of the precariousness of their position in society. She sums up the stark contrast between how women are idealised in fiction written by men, and how patriarchal society has treated them in real life:\n\nWomen have burnt like beacons in all the works of all the poets from the beginning of time. Indeed if woman had no existence save in the fiction written by men, one would imagine her a person of the utmost importance; very various; heroic and mean; splendid and sordid; beautiful and hideous in the extreme; as great as a man, some would say greater. But this is woman in fiction. In fact, as Professor Trevelyan points out, she was locked up, beaten and flung about the room. A very queer, composite being thus emerges. Imaginatively she is of the highest importance; practically she is completely insignificant. She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all but absent from history. She dominates the lives of kings and conquerors in fiction; in fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger. Some of the most inspired words and profound thoughts in literature fall from her lips; in real life she could hardly read; scarcely spell; and was the property of her husband.\n\n\n==== Judith Shakespeare ====\n\nIn section 3 Woolf invents a fictional character, Judith, Shakespeare's sister, to illustrate that a woman with Shakespeare's gifts would have been denied the opportunity to develop them. Like Woolf, who stayed at home while her brothers went off to school, Judith is trapped in the home: \"She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as agog to see the world as he was. But she was not sent to school.\"\nWhile William learns, Judith is chastised by her parents should she happen to pick up a book, as she is inevitably abandoning some household chore to which she could be attending. Judith is betrothed, and when she does not want to marry, her father beats her, then shames her into the marriage. While William establishes himself, Judith is trapped by what is expected of women. She runs away from home to London, is harassed and laughed at when she tries to become an actor, and is finally made pregnant by an actor-manager who said he would help her. She kills herself and \"lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses now stop outside the Elephant and Castle\". William lives on and establishes his legacy.\n\n\n=== Building a history of women's writing ===\n\nIn the essay, Woolf constructs a critical and historical account of women writers thus far.  Woolf examines the careers of several female authors, including Aphra Behn, Jane Austen, the Brontë sisters, Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, and George Eliot.\nIn addition to female authors, Woolf also discusses and draws inspiration from noted scholar and feminist Jane Ellen Harrison. Harrison is presented in the essay only by her initials separated by long dashes, and Woolf first introduces Harrison as \"the famous scholar, could it be J---- H---- herself?\"\nWoolf also discusses Rebecca West, questioning Desmond MacCarthy's (referred to as \"Z\") uncompromising dismissal of West as an \"'arrant feminist'\". Among the men attacked for their views on women, F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead (referred to as \"Lord Birkenhead\") is mentioned, although Woolf further rebukes his ideas in stating she will not \"trouble to copy out Lord Birkenhead's opinion upon the writing of women\". Birkenhead was an opponent of suffrage. The essay quotes Oscar Browning, through the words of his (possibly inaccurate) biographer H. E. Wortham, \"that the impression left on his mind, after looking over any set of examination papers, was that, irrespective of the marks he might give, the best woman was intellectually the inferior of the worst man\".\n\n\n=== Lesbianism ===\nWoolf wrote in her diary before A Room of One's Own was published that she thought when it was published she would be \"attacked for a feminist & hinted at for a sapphist\".\nIn one section of the book, describing the work of a fictional woman writer, Mary Carmichael, Woolf deliberately invokes lesbianism: \"Then may I tell you that the very next words I read were these – 'Chloe liked Olivia ...' Do not start. Do not blush. Let us admit in the privacy of our own society that these things sometimes happen. Sometimes women do like women.\" Woolf references the obscenity trial and public uproar resulting from the publishing of Radclyffe Hall's lesbian-themed novel The Well of Loneliness (1928). Before she can discuss Chloe liking Olivia, the narrator has to be assured that Sir Chartres Biron, the magistrate of Hall's obscenity trial, is not in the audience: \"Are there no men present? Do you promise the figure of Sir Chartres Biron is not concealed? We are all women, you assure me? Then I may tell you ...\"\nWoolf scholar and feminist critic Jane Marcus believes Woolf was giving Radclyffe Hall and other writers a demonstration of how to discuss lesbianism discreetly enough to avoid obscenity trials; \"Woolf was offering her besieged fellow writer a lesson in how to give a lesbian talk and write a lesbian work and get away with it.\"\n\n\n=== Androgyny ===\nMarilyn R. Farwell has shed light on the difficulty around understanding androgyny in Woolf's work. Nancy Topping Bazin defines Woolf's concept of androgyny as \"the masculine and feminine should be balanced but not fused.\" In her definition, Bazin reveals an important debate in understanding androgyny: whether to see it as a balance or fusion of two parts.\nSome critics describe Woolf's concept of androgyny as a balance between various poles: intuition and reason, subjectivity and objectivity, anima and animus, heterosexuality and homosexuality, and manic and depressive. Androgyny in a writer translates to accepting both intuition and rationality as a way to knowledge. The interpretation of androgyny as balance would imply validating many voices and perceptions.\nOn the other hand, seeing androgyny as a fusion would validate only a single mode of knowing. Farwell argues that since \"the universal is most often identified with whatever is male, this definition can be and has been another means for demanding that a woman write like a man.\" Farwell interprets Woolf's ambivalence in defining androgyny from fear of being called a feminist.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nAlice Walker responded to Woolf's observation that only women with 'a room of their own' are in a position to write. Woolf herself was making the point that not all women in her society had such a safe space, but Walker continues the conversation by discussing the further exclusions suffered by women of colour. In In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose, Walker writes:\n\nVirginia Woolf, in her book A Room of One's Own, wrote that in order for a woman to write fiction she must have two things, certainly: a room of her own (with key and lock) and enough money to support herself.\nWhat then are we to make of Phillis Wheatley, a slave, who owned not even herself? This sickly, frail, Black girl who required a servant of her own at times—her health was so precarious—and who, had she been white, would have been easily considered the intellectual superior of all the women and most of the men in the society of her day.\n\n\n== Adaptations and influence ==\nA Room of One's Own was adapted as a play by Patrick Garland that premiered in 1989 with Eileen Atkins; a television adaptation of that play was broadcast on PBS Masterpiece Theatre in 1991.\nPatricia Lamkin's play Balancing the Moon (2011) was inspired by the essay.\nCultural ventures have been named after A Room of One's Own. In 1975 the Wisconsin bookstore A Room of One's Own was founded by five women as a feminist bookstore. A literary journal launched in Vancouver, Canada in 1975 by the West Coast Feminist Literary Magazine Society, or the Growing Room Collective, was originally called Room of One's Own but changed to Room in 2007. Additionally, the Leather Archives and Museum, founded in 1991, had in 2016 an exhibit called A Room of Her Own, about which curator Alex Warner has written, \"As I began work for the first exhibit installation of the Women's Leather History Project, I was excited that we were both literally and figuratively making room for Leatherwomen's history in the LA&M. It was out of this line of thinking that \"A Room of Her Own\" emerged, building on Virginia Woolf's 1929 feminist text that argues for women's need for space to think and create\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nFeminism: The Essential Historical Writings (1972), a notable anthology in which A Room of One's Own is included\nLe Monde's 100 Books of the Century, which lists A Room of One's Own as number 69\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n A Room of One's Own public domain audiobook at LibriVox\nFull text of A Room of One's Own at HathiTrust Digital Library\nFull text of A Room of One's Own at Project Gutenberg Australia, in one page for easy searching\nLongworth, Deborah (1 March 2017). \"Virginia Woolf and Feminist Aesthetics\", lecture on A Room of One's Own, University of Birmingham\n Media related to A Room of One's Own at Wikimedia Commons\n The full text of A Room of One's Own at Wikisource",

As part of this effect, O'Brien dedicates The Things They Carried to the fictional men of the \"Alpha Company,\" giving it “the form of a war memoir,” states O’Brien.\n\n\n== Plot summaries ==\n\"The Things They Carried\"\n\nLieutenant Jimmy Cross, the leader of a platoon of soldiers in Vietnam, carries physical reminders of Martha, the object of his unrequited love. Thoughts of Martha often distract Lieutenant Cross from his team's objectives. A death in the squad under his supervision causes Cross to reconsider his priorities; as he was heartbroken, he burns and throws away all reminders of Martha in order to focus on the mission and avoid distractions.\n\n\"Love\"\n\nCross and O'Brien reminisce about the war and about Martha. O'Brien asks if he can write a story about Cross, expressing his memories and hopes for the future; Cross agrees, thinking that perhaps Martha will read it and come find him.\n\n\"Spin\"\n\nA series of unrelated memories from the war is narrated from O'Brien's point of view. It includes moments of camaraderie and beauty: a joke of a hate letter to the Draft Board; learning a rain dance between battles.\n\n\"On the Rainy River\"\n\nO'Brien gets drafted as soon as he graduates from college. He is reluctant to go to war and considers fleeing the draft; he begins to travel north to the Canada–US border on the Rainy River. Near the border, he encounters an elderly stranger who allows him to work through his internal struggle. O'Brien is given the opportunity to escape; however, the societal pressures are too much for him. He goes to war ashamed with his inability to face the consequences of leaving.\n\n\"Enemies and Friends\"\nTold in two sections, the developing relationship between soldiers Jensen and Strunk is shown. At first regularly antagonized by one another, the two are drawn toward respect and friendship by the stress and horrors of warfare. Ultimately, they agree that if one should be wounded, the other must deal a fatal blow as a form of mercy.\n\n\"How to Tell a True War Story\"\n\nO'Brien explores the telling of war stories by comrades, revealing that truth is delicate and malleable. Anything can be faked ... but generally, only the worst events can be proven real. He concludes that, in the end, the truth of a story doesn't matter so much as what the story is trying to say.\n\n\"The Dentist\"\n\nIn order to mourn Curt Lemon, a man O'Brien did not know well, he shares a brief recollection about a bizarre interaction between Lemon and an army dentist. Lemon, who is afraid of dentists, faints before the dentist can examine him. Later that night, however, he complains of a phantom tooth ache so severe a tooth is pulled - even though it's perfectly healthy. Lemon has felt he needs to prove himself in front of his men and be the fearless man all soldiers are supposed to be.\n\n\"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong\"\n\nO'Brien recounts the legendary (and almost certainly exaggerated) tale of Rat Kiley's first assignment, near the Song Tra Bong river. The area is so isolated that one of the soldiers flies his hometown girlfriend in by helicopter. At first, she cooks, cleans, and tends to the soldiers' wounds, but she gradually assimilates into Vietnamese guerrilla culture, even wearing a necklace made of human tongues, and disappears into the jungle.\n\n\"Stockings\"\n\nO'Brien explains how Henry Dobbins wore the stockings of his girlfriend around his neck to bed, and sometimes to battle. Even when the girlfriend breaks things off, he keeps the stockings around his neck, as their powers have been demonstrated.\n\n\"Church\"\n\nThe platoon discovers an abandoned building being used as a sort of church, inhabited by monks who bring them food and supplies. The men discuss their relationships with churches, and for the most part, appreciate the interaction with other people and the peace of the building. Henry Dobbins wants to become a priest, but decides otherwise.\n\n\"The Man I Killed\"\n\nO'Brien describes a man he killed in My Khe, and how he did it. He makes up a life story for the man, torturing himself with the idea that the victim had been a gentle soul.\n\n\"Ambush\"\n\nO'Brien's daughter asks if he killed anyone in the war; he lies to her that he did not. He then tells the story of an ambush outside My Khe, in which O'Brien kills a young man who may or may not have wanted to harm him.\n\n\"Style\"\nThe platoon witnesses a young Vietnamese girl dancing through the burned remains of her village, and argue over whether it's a ritual or simply what she likes to do. Later, Azar mocks the girl, and Dobbins rebukes him.\n\n\"Speaking of Courage\"\n\nAfter his service, Norman Bowker is at a loss. His former girlfriend has married someone else, his closest friends are dead. He reflects on the medals he won in Vietnam, and imagines telling his father about both these and the medals he did not win. Ultimately, although he has no one to share these memories with, he finds catharsis in imagined conversations.\n\n\"Notes\"\n\nO'Brien says that Bowker asked him to write the previous story, and that he hanged himself three years later unable to regain his footing and find any meaning in life after the war. O'Brien muses over the suspicion that, without Harvard and writing, he too might have lost the will to live after returning from Vietnam.\n\n\"In the Field\"\n\nWhen Kiowa is killed on the banks of a river, during a mission led by Jimmy Cross, Cross takes responsibility for his death. He writes to Kiowa's father while the others search for the body - as usual, Azar jokes around at first. Another soldier also feels responsible for the death, as he did not save Kiowa; the story ends with the body being found in the mud, and both soldiers left to their guilt.\n\n\"Good Form\"\n\nO'Brien reiterates that the real truth does not have to be the same as the story truth, and that it is the emotions evoked by the story that matter. He says that his story about killing a man on the trail outside My Khe was fabricated, but he wanted to provoke the same feelings in the reader that he felt during the war.\n\n\"Field Trip\"\n\nAfter finishing the story, \"In the Field,\" O'Brien says, he and his ten-year-old daughter visit the site of Kiowa's death with an interpreter. The field looks different from his memory of it, but he leaves a pair of Kiowa's moccasins in the spot where he believes Kiowa sank. In this way, he comes to terms with his friend's death.\n\n\"The Ghost Soldiers\"\n\nO'Brien recounts the two times he was wounded. The first time, he is treated by Rat Kiley, and is impressed with the man's courage and skill. The second time, he is treated by Kiley's replacement, Bobby Jorgenson; Jorgenson is incompetent, and nearly kills O'Brien. Furious, O'Brien promises revenge, but can recruit only Azar. They scare Jorgenson by pretending to be enemy soldiers, but the soldier proves that he is not a coward, so O'Brien lets go of his resentment.\n\n\"Night Life\"\n\nO'Brien tells the second-hand account of Rat Kiley's injury: warned of a possible attack, the platoon is on edge. Kiley reacts by distancing himself, the stress causing him first to be silent for days on end, and then to talk constantly. He has a breakdown from the pressure of being a medic, and shoots himself in the toe in order to get released from combat. No one questions his bravery.\n\n\"The Lives of the Dead\"\n\nO'Brien remembers his very first encounter with a dead body, that of his childhood sweetheart Linda. Suffering from a brain tumor, Linda died at the age of nine and O'Brien was deeply affected by her funeral. In Vietnam, O'Brien explains, the soldiers keep the dead alive by telling stories about them; in this way, he keeps Linda alive by telling her story. The thought and presence of death has shown to have a large effect on O'Brien.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== Main characters ===\nTim O'Brien\nThe narrator and the protagonist. While modeled after the author and sharing the same name, O'Brien (within the book) is a fictional character. The author intentionally blurs this distinction.\nLt. Jimmy Cross\nThe platoon leader, who is obsessed with a young woman back home, Martha (who does not return his feelings). He later believes that his obsession led to the death of Ted Lavender.\nBob \"Rat\" Kiley\nA young medic whose exaggerations are complemented by his occasional cruelty. Eventually, he sees too much gore and begins to break down, imagining \"the bugs are out to get [him].\"\nNorman Bowker\nA soldier who O'Brien says attempted to save Kiowa the night he died. When Kiowa slips into the \"shitfield\", Bowker repeatedly tries to save him but is unable to; as a result, he feels guilty for Kiowa's death after the war. His memories continue to haunt Norman at home as he realizes that the world has moved on from the war, and wants nothing to do with the \"hell\" in Vietnam. He is continually haunted by the fact that he could not save Kiowa from sinking under the \"shitfield\" on a rainy night. However, O'Brien admits eventually that Norman did not fail to save Kiowa, that was fictional, and it is implied that O'Brien himself was the one who could not save him. After the war he briefly assists O'Brien in writing a story about Vietnam, but he hangs himself with a jump rope in an Iowa YMCA facility, leaving no note and his family shocked.\nHenry Dobbins\nMachine gunner.  A man who, despite having a rather large frame, is gentle and kind. He is very superstitious; as a result, he wears his girlfriend's pantyhose around his neck as a protective \"charm\", even after she dumps him. He briefly contemplates becoming a monk after the war due to their acts of charity.\nKiowa\nA compassionate and talkative soldier; he demonstrates the importance of talking about one's problems and traumatic experiences. He is also a devout Baptist and a Native American who occasionally feels contempt and distrust towards white people. However, he appears to be Tim O'Brien's best friend in the company. Kiowa often helps other soldiers deal with their actions, such as taking the lives of other human beings. He is eventually killed when camping out in the \"shitfield.\"\nMitchell Sanders\nHe is the radiotelephone operator for the platoon. Like O'Brien, he is also a storyteller and is portrayed as a mentor.\nTed Lavender\nA grenadier. He dies from a gunshot wound to the back of the head. He is notorious for using tranquilizers to cope with the pain of war, and for carrying a (rather large—six to eight ounces) stash of \"premium dope\" with him. Cross blames himself for Lavender's death, as he was fantasizing about Martha when Lavender was shot.\nCurt Lemon\nA young man who frequently attempts to assume the role as a tough soldier. However, he is also good friend of Rat Kiley. Lemon dies after setting off a rigged artillery shell. In one of the book's more disturbing scenes, O'Brien and Dave Jensen help clear the trees of Curt's scattered remains, during which Jensen sings \"Lemon Tree\" (something that \"wakes [Tim] up\"). After Lemon dies, Kiley writes a long, eloquent letter to Lemon's sister, describing his friendship with Lemon and emphasizing how good a person Lemon was; Lemon's sister never responds, which crushes Kiley emotionally.\nAzar\nA young, rather unstable soldier who engages in needless and frequent acts of brutality. In one story, he blows up an orphan puppy that Ted Lavender had adopted by strapping it to a Claymore mine, then detonating it. He also aids Tim O'Brien in gaining revenge on Bobby Jorgenson, but mocks O'Brien when he's not willing to take the revenge further. At one point, Azar breaks down emotionally, revealing that his cruelty is merely a defense mechanism.\nDave Jensen and Lee Strunk\nMinor soldiers who are the main characters of \"Enemies\" and \"Friends\". Jensen fights with Strunk over a stolen jackknife, but they became uneasy friends afterwards. They each sign a pact to kill the other if he is ever faced with a \"wheelchair wound\". After Strunk steps on a rigged mortar round and loses a leg, he begs Jensen not to kill him. Jensen obliges, but seems to have an enormous weight relieved when he learns \"Strunk died somewhere over in Chu Lai\". Jensen is sometimes mentioned singing \"Lemon Tree\" after Curt Lemon's abrupt death. Jensen also appears in \"The Lives of the Dead\", where he pressures O'Brien to shake hands with a dead Vietnamese.\nBobby Jorgenson\nRat Kiley's replacement, after Rat \"put a round through his foot\" due to breaking under pressure. Green and terrified, he is slow to aid O'Brien when he is shot in the behind.  Jorgenson nearly kills O'Brien after failing to treat him for shock. Filled with rage after his recovery, O'Brien elicits help from Azar to conspire and punish Jorgenson with a night of terrifying pranks.  Later, O'Brien and Jorgenson become friends. Jorgenson may be a reference to a similarly-named character from The Caine Mutiny.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nGenre\nThe Things They Carried is a war novel.  Literary Critic David Wyatt points out that O'Brien's novel is similar to the works of Wilfred Owen, Stephen Crane, George Orwell, and Ernest Hemingway. O’Brien utilizes a style of writing that combines both fiction and nonfiction together into one piece. When asked to describe how he blurs this line between the two genres, O’Brien says \"I set out to write a book with the feel of utter and absolute reality, a work of fiction that would read like nonfiction and adhere to the conventions of a memoir: dedicating the book to the characters, using my name, drawing on my own life. This was a technical challenge. My goal was to compose a fiction with the texture, sound and authentic-seeming weight of nonfiction.\"\nTruth vs Reality\nAnother theme that is highlighted in the short story \"Good Form\" is when the narrator makes a distinction between \"story truth\" and \"happening truth.\" O’Brien talks about truth and reality in relation to the story by describing, \"I can say that the book’s form is intimately connected to how I, as a human being, tend to view the world unfolding itself around me. It’s sometimes difficult to separate external 'reality' from the internal processing of that reality.\" O'Brien's fluid and elliptical negotiation of truth in this context finds echoes in works labeled as 'non-fiction novels'.\nImagination/Comedy\nAnother important theme O'Brien highlights is the emphasis on imagination and pretending. He says that this theme, \"That’s an important part of my work. I’m a believer in the power of the imagination in ordinary human lives, and it’s much more important that we often credit.\" O'Brien goes on to say, \"And that is, I think, key to why I’m a fiction writer. If that element were not present, I’d be doing nonfiction. Or I wouldn’t be a writer at all.\" Tim O'Brien also alludes to the difficulty in using dark comedy as a theme by say, \"My guess is that I’ll be remembered, if I’m remembered at all, for my so-called tragedies: The Things They Carried, Going After Cacciato, If I Die in a Combat Zone and In the Lake of the Woods. Personally, I consider Tomcat in Love, if not my best book, certainly up there among the best. Yet I realize the most “literary” folks will disagree. In the end, it’s a matter of taste, I suppose. My sense of humor, which tends toward the outrageous, is plainly not for everyone.\" \nMorality\nO’Brien also shows the constant struggle of morality throughout the story during the Vietnam War. A paper from Brigham Young University highlights the conflict that soldiers face when transitioning from civilian life to soldier life in relation to morality. It states, “As demonstrated through the soldiers’ experiences with pleasure, the soldiers’ moral code must change from that of their civilian lives in order for them to find moral justification in the everyday violence war requires.” The paper goes on to acknowledge that, “In O’Brien’s The Things They Carried, the concept of morality is complicated by the treatment of violence and a connection between violence and pleasure; resultantly, morality must be defined on a spectrum rather than a binary scale.”\nBelief\nAdditionally, the character Tim references writing the book Going After Cacciato which the author Tim had written and published previously. The theme of believing in the people around you and having reliable people with you comes from the time period being filled with people who are opposed to the action of war. This causes the people who are drafted into the mutual hate to band together to live.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nBefore the book's publication in 1990, five of the stories: \"The Things They Carried,\" \"How to Tell a True War Story,\"  \"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong,\" \"The Ghost Soldiers,\" and \"The Lives of the Dead\" were published in Esquire.\n\"Speaking of Courage\" was originally published (in heavily modified form) as a chapter of O'Brien's earlier novel Going After Cacciato.\n\"The Things They Carried\" was also included in the 1987 volume of The Best American Short Stories, edited by Ann Beattie and the second edition of Literature: Approaches to Fiction, Poetry, and Drama by Robert DiYanni.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Things They Carried has received critical acclaim and has been established as one of the preeminent pieces of Vietnam War literature. It has sold over 2 million copies worldwide and celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2010. It has received multiple awards such as France's Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger Award and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize, as well as being a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award.\nO'Brien has expressed surprise at how the book has become a staple in middle schools and high schools, stating that he \"certainly hadn't imagined fourteen year-old kids and eighteen year-olds and those even in their early twenties reading the book and bringing such fervor to it, which comes from their own lives, really. The book is applied to a bad childhood or a broken home, and these are the things they're carrying. And in a way, it's extremely flattering, and other times, it can be depressing.\"\nIn 2014, the book was included in Amazon.com's list of 100 Books to Read in a Lifetime and credited as the inspiration for a National Veterans Art Museum exhibit.\nIt was included in the Library of Congress 2016 exhibit \"America Reads\" of the public’s choice of 65 of \"the most influential books written and read in America and their impact on our lives\".\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe song Pantyhose by band TV Girl describes the plot of the chapter Stockings.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe story \"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong\" was made into a film in 1998 titled A Soldier's Sweetheart, starring Kiefer Sutherland.\nA film adaptation of the book, directed by Rupert Sanders and starring Tom Hardy, is currently in pre-production. Scott B. Smith is adapting the script.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nThe legal rights to adapt the book into a play were awarded to James R. Stowell. The book was adapted into a play and it premiered at The History Theatre in Saint Paul, Minnesota, March 14, 2014. A second production was performed at The Lied Center, Lincoln Nebraska November 5, 2015. The stories \"The Things They Carried\", \"On the Rainy River\", \"How to Tell a True War Story\", \"Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong\", \"The Man I Killed\", and \"Lives of the Dead\" were adapted for the theatre in March 2011 by the Eastern Washington University Theatre Department as part of the universities' Get Lit! Literary Festival in cooperation with the National Endowment for the Arts The Big Read 2011, of which The Things They Carried was the featured novel. The same department remounted the production in December 2011 for inclusion as a Participating Entry in the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival. The production was selected as an alternate for KCACTF Region VII, as well as receiving other KCACTF honors for the production's director, actors, and production staff.\n\n\n=== Games ===\nCarry. A game about war. is a 2006 tabletop role-playing game designed by Nathan D. Paoletta. Its author describes it as \"heavily inspired by the films Platoon and Full Metal Jacket and the novel The Things They Carried\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAn Index to The Things They Carried",

    "full_narrative": "Redeployment is a collection of short stories by American writer Phil Klay. His first published book, it won the 2014 National Book Award for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle's 2014 John Leonard Award given for a best first book in any genre.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe book consists of twelve stories that chronicle the experiences of soldiers and veterans who served during the Iraq War, specifically Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003 – 2010). Klay served in the United States Marine Corps from 2005 to 2009. He was deployed to the Anbar Province in 2007–8.\nKlay has said that before and during his service in Iraq he did not have a \"clear sense\" that he was going to write about war, but that when he shared his plan to enter the military upon graduation, his Dartmouth College teacher and mentor, the American poet Tom Sleigh:\n\n \"...made sure that before I went I'd read Tolstoy, Hemingway, Isaac Babel and David Jones. He thought it important to study what the greatest minds had to say about war.\"\nKlay spent four years writing Redeployment. The book's title story first appeared in the literary magazine Granta. It was reprinted in Fire and Forget: Short Stories from the Long War, an anthology of war fiction. Klay has stated that the process of writing the stories that became Redeployment involved years of meticulous research.\nKlay has described his own deployment in Iraq as \"a mild experience\" where he did not see the war itself but only the effects of war second hand. To depict the war, he created a dozen characters, each with a different set of experiences and perspectives. Avoiding cliches and creating \"prototypes\", he has said, \"was something I took very seriously. I did a lot a research, I talked to a lot of Marines, and spent a lot of time thinking about the subjects. Doing the kind of imaginative work, drafting stories over and over again until I had something that felt emotionally honest, which is also not the same as something that's going to please everyone who’s been through that experience.\" He said he needed multiples voices because:\n\n...each person has such a small piece of the war, and that piece will be powerfully shaped not only by when they were there and where in Iraq they were, but also by what job they did. So rather than writing a unified novel about the experience of war, I wanted twelve different voices—voices that would approach similar themes but from very different perspectives. I don't think all my narrators would get along with each other. I don't think they'd agree with each other about what the war meant. And part of my intent was that that would open a space for the reader to come in and critically engage with the sorts of claims the narrators are making.... Also, it's just fascinating to me to step into very different heads. What was the war like for a mortuary affairs specialist? For a chaplain? For an artilleryman, who never sees the bodies of the enemy he has killed?\nHe said he had some models in mind of what he did not want to do: \"There have been a couple books in the last couple years with almost comical misrepresentations of the military by authors who wanted to talk about Iraq, but clearly didn't want to do the hard work of learning enough about the subject to have something worth saying.\" Klay included in Redeployment a list of works he read and found valuable in helping to shape his writing. He explained that:\n\n...before writing about a foreign service officer I read a memoir by one who'd served in Iraq, a fairly wonky book about career diplomacy, a lot of Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction reports, and so on. I also read a Czech World War I novel that seemed appropriate to gear me up, in terms of tone, and I talked to Civil Affairs soldiers and Foreign Service Officers, and I read a lot of journalism. Not everything I read was about war. Bernanos's Diary of a Country Priest and Edward P. Jones's The Known World and Nathan Englander's short stories, for example, were all very helpful at different points for different stories.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn the New York Times, Dexter Filkins wrote: \"It's the best thing written so far on what the war did to people’s souls.\" In The Guardian, Edward Docx wrote:\n\n[I]t is definitely in the combined effect of the stories that Redeployment garners its power and earns the comparisons to Tim O'Brien's writing on Vietnam that it has been getting in America. Indeed, Klay's gifts become more apparent with each new narrator and circumstance: his reach, his tonal control, his observational sophistication, the sheer emotional torque of his narratives. By the end, he had convincingly inhabited more than a dozen different voices and I felt I had learned more about Iraq than in any documentary or factual account.\nWriting in the Daily Beast, Brian Castner described the book \"a clinic in the profanities of war\". He wrote:\n\nIf there is a flaw to be found here it is only one of narrowness; all of these narrators are American men and most are Marines. But the voices are strong and varied, and we hear from enlisted men and officers, chaplains and lawyers, State Department do-gooders  and college students, and, of course, many grunts. The book contains plenty of blood-dead-hajji-fuck-kill-love, but also stories that violate innocence and faith itself. If obscenity scrapes just the skin then through the narrative arc of tragedy and suffering Klay has managed to dig down to the organs.\nOn November 19, Redeployment received the 2014 National Book Award for fiction. The judges described it as a \"brutal, piercing sometimes darkly funny collection\" that \"stakes Klay's claim for consideration as the quintessential storyteller of America's Iraq conflict.\" In his acceptance speech, he said: \"I can't think of a more important conversation to be having — war's too strange to be processed alone. I want to thank everyone who picked up the book, who read it and decided to join the conversation.\" National Public Radio reported that:\n\nAcross a dozen stories told in first-person, Redeployment is at its heart a meditation on war — and the responsibility that everyone, especially the average citizen, bears for it.\nThe New York Times included Redeployment on its list of the \"Ten Best Books of 2014\". On January 19, 2015 it was announced by the National Book Critics Circle that Redeployment received its 2014 John Leonard Award for \"a best first book published in any genre.\"\nIn May 2015 The Chautauqua Institute announced that Redeployment won the 2015 Chautauqua Prize. The Chautauqua Prize is awarded annually to commemorate a book of fiction or literary/narrative nonfiction that provides a richly rewarding reading experience and honors the author for a significant contribution to the literary arts.\nIn June 2015, the American Library Association announced that Klay's Redeployment was the 2015 recipient of the W. Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction. In November 2015, Redeployment was awarded the Warwick Prize for Writing for 2015.\n\n\n== References ==",

Informally, the novels comprise The Forever War series; the novel also inspired a comic book and a board game. The Forever War is the first title in the SF Masterworks series.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nWilliam Mandella is a physics student conscripted for an elite task force in the United Nations Exploratory Force being assembled for a war against the Taurans, an alien species discovered when they apparently attacked human colonists' ships. The UNEF ground troops are sent out for reconnaissance and revenge. The elite recruits have IQs of 150 and above, are highly educated, healthy, and fit. Training is grueling – first on Earth and later on a planet called \"Charon\" beyond Pluto (written before the discovery of the actual planetoid). Several of the recruits die during training due to the extreme environments and the use of live weapons. The new soldiers complete training and immediately depart for action via interconnected \"collapsars\" that allow ships to cover thousands of light-years in a split second. However, crucially, traveling to and from the collapsars at near-lightspeed has enormous relativistic time effects.\nOn their first encounter with Taurans, on a planet orbiting Epsilon Aurigae, their post-hypnotic training is triggered, which causes them to massacre the Taurans despite their lack of resistance. This first expedition, beginning in 1997, lasts only two years from the soldiers' point of view, but due to time dilation, they return to Earth in 2024. During the expedition's second battle, the soldiers experience future shock first-hand, as the Taurans have much more advanced weaponry. Mandella, with fellow soldier and lover Marygay Potter, returns to civilian life, only to find humanity drastically changed. He and the other discharged soldiers have difficulty fitting into a society that has altered almost beyond their comprehension. The veterans learn that, to curb overpopulation, which led to class wars around the world caused by inequitable rationing, homosexuality has become officially encouraged by many of the world's nations. The world has become a very dangerous place due to mass unemployment and the easy availability of weapons. Alienated, Mandella and many other veterans re-enlist, despite the extremely high casualty rate and their recognition that the military is a soulless construct. Mandella and Potter receive promised postings as instructors on Luna, but upon arrival are immediately reassigned to a combat command.\nAlmost entirely through luck, Mandella survives four years of military service, while several centuries elapse for humanity in general. He soon becomes the objectively oldest surviving soldier in the war, attaining high rank through seniority rather than ambition. He and Potter (who is his last link with the Earth of his youth) are eventually given different assignments, meaning that even if they both survive the war they will likely never meet again due to time dilation. After briefly contemplating suicide, Mandella assumes the post of commanding officer of a \"strike force\", commanding soldiers who speak a language largely unrecognizable to him, whose ethnicity is now nearly uniform ('vaguely Polynesian' in appearance) and who are exclusively homosexual. He is disliked by his soldiers and he assumes this is because they had to learn 21st century English to communicate with him and other senior staff and because he is heterosexual.\nEngaging in combat thousands of light years away from Earth, Mandella and his soldiers need to resort to medieval weapons to fight inside a stasis field which neutralizes all electromagnetic radiation in anything not covered with a protective coating. Upon return, the strike force learns this is the last battle of the war. Humanity has begun to clone itself, resulting in a new, collective species calling itself simply Man. Man is able to communicate with the Taurans, who are also clones. It is discovered that the war started due to a misunderstanding; the colony ships were lost to accidents and those on Earth with a vested interest in a new war used these disappearances as an excuse to begin the conflict. The futile, meaningless war, which had lasted for more than a thousand years, ends.\nMan has established several colonies of old-style, heterosexual humans, just in case the evolutionary change proves to be a mistake. Mandella travels to one of these colonies (named \"Middle Finger\" in the definitive version of the novel) where he is reunited with Potter, who had been discharged much earlier and had taken trips in space to use time dilation to age at a much slower rate, hoping for Mandella's return. The epilogue is a news item from the year 3143 announcing the birth of a \"fine baby boy\" to Marygay Potter-Mandella.\n\n\n== Reception and interpretation ==\nThe novel is widely perceived to be a portrayal of the author's military service during the Vietnam War, and has been called an account of his war experiences written through a space opera filter. Other hints of the autobiographical nature of the work are the protagonist's surname, Mandella, which is a near-anagram of the author's surname; Mandella being a physics student, like Haldeman, as well as the name of the lead female character, Marygay Potter, which is nearly identical to Haldeman's wife's maiden name. If one accepts this reading of the book, the alienation experienced by the soldiers on returning to Earth – here caused by the time dilation effect – becomes a clear metaphor for the reception given to US troops returning to America from Vietnam, including the way in which the war ultimately proves useless and its result meaningless. He also subverts typical space opera clichés (such as the heroic soldier influencing battles through individual acts) and \"demonstrates how absurd many of the old clichés look to someone who had seen real combat duty\".\n\n\n=== Connection to Starship Troopers ===\nHaldeman has stated that The Forever War is a result of his experiences in the Vietnam War, although he has also said that he was influenced by Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers. Haldeman said that he disagreed with Starship Troopers because it \"glorifies war\" but added that \"it's a very well-crafted novel and I believe Heinlein was honest with it\".\nThe Forever War contains several parallels to Starship Troopers, including its setting and the powered armor that Heinlein's novel first popularized. Commentators have described it as a reaction to Heinlein's novel, a suggestion Haldeman denies; the two novels are very different in terms of their attitude towards the military. The Forever War does not depict war as a noble pursuit, with the sides clearly defined as good and evil; instead, the novel explores the dehumanizing effect of war, influenced by the real-world context of the Vietnam War.\nHeinlein wrote a letter to Haldeman, congratulating Haldeman on his Nebula Award; Haldeman has said that Heinlein's letter \"meant more than the award itself\". According to author Spider Robinson, Heinlein approached Haldeman at the awards banquet and said the book \"may be the best future war story I've ever read!\"\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe Forever War was originally written as Haldeman's MFA thesis for the Iowa Writer's Workshop. It was first published as a serial in Analog Magazine before its first book publication in 1974. Since then, many editions of The Forever War have been published. Editions published prior to 1991 were abridged for space by the original editor (omitting the middle section, a novella titled You Can Never Go Back). These early paperback editions have \"a white cover showing a man in a spacesuit with a sword, with symbolic clocks all around,\" according to the author, with alternatively the first hardcover edition featuring a large hourglass with planets falling through it.\nThe 1991 edition restored many expurgated sections, primarily dealing with the changes that befall human civilization over the course of William Mandella's life. This version's cover \"has a futuristic soldier who looks like Robin Williams in a funny hat,\" as Haldeman notes, \"But alas, not all of the changes got in, and the book has some internal contradictions because of things left over from the [earlier version].\"\nIn 1997, Avon published the version that Haldeman called \"definitive\", with \"everything restored\" and \"a less funny cover illustration.\" This version was republished twice, first in October 2001 as a hardback with a cover showing spaceships in battle over a planet, and again in September 2003, with the cover art depicting a device worn over the eye of a soldier.\nIn 1999, it was republished by Millennium, an imprint of the Orion Publishing Group, as part of the SF Masterworks series. It featured as the first novel re-printed in the series, and the cover shows a close-up of Marygay Potter with soldiers and spaceships in the background. This is the same version as the 1997 Avon publication and has the same Author's Note.\nIn 1999, Haldeman, at the request of Robert Silverberg, wrote Marygay's first-person account of her time of separation from Mandella. It included not only the military details but also the difficulty of coping as a lone heterosexual woman with a society where same-sex relations are the inflexible norm. The story was included in Silverberg's anthology Far Horizons (1999), and later was the title story in the collection of Haldeman stories A Separate War and Other Stories (2006). In his \"Notes on the Stories\" for that collection, Haldeman commented that \"it was fun to write her story, both as a bridge to the sequel (Forever Free) and as an oblique commentary on The Forever War, twenty years later.\"\nIn 2006, an omnibus edition containing the books Forever War, Forever Free, and Forever Peace (under the title Peace and War) was published by Gollancz. The cover depicts a futuristic gun barrel stuck into the ground with a smashed spacesuit helmet placed on top, a science-fiction version of a battlefield cross. The author's note at the start of the book describes the edition as containing the definitive versions.\nThe most recent print edition was released in 2009 (ISBN 9780312536633) with an additional foreword by John Scalzi. The cover art depicts a soldier in a spacesuit in a jungle environment. Haldeman describes it as \"the definitive version\" in the author's note preceding the text of the novel.\nAn ebook version was released in July 2011 by Ridan Publishing and also contained the foreword by Scalzi and introductions by Haldeman and Robin Sullivan (President of Ridan Publishing). The cover art depicts a soldier in a war-torn setting looking down at the helmet of a fallen comrade.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Stage play ===\nStuart Gordon adapted the novel for Chicago's Organic Theater Company in 1983, in part as a reaction to what Gordon considered the \"ultra-sanitized video game\" style Star Wars brought to science fiction. The play starred Bruce A. Young as William Mandella.\n\n\n=== Game ===\nMayfair Games published a board game based on the novel in 1983.\n\n\n=== Graphic novel ===\n\nBelgian comic writer Marvano has, in cooperation with Haldeman, created a graphic novel trilogy of The Forever War. With some very minor changes and omissions to storyline and setting, it faithfully adapts the same themes in visual style. The series was translated into various languages, and had a follow-up trilogy connected to Forever Free.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1988, Richard Edlund (who won Visual Effects Oscars for Star Wars, Empire, Raiders, Jedi) began to option the rights to The Forever War. In October 1994, he bought the rights to the property. In 2008, he optioned the rights to Ridley Scott, who announced that, after a 25-year wait for the rights to become available, he was making a return to science fiction with a film adaptation of The Forever War. In March 2009, Scott stated that the film would be in 3D, citing James Cameron's Avatar as an inspiration for doing so. In the summer of 2010, Scott revealed that State of Play writer Matthew Michael Carnahan was currently on the fourth draft of a screenplay originally written by David Peoples.  As of May 2014, Haldeman stated he believed the project was on its seventh draft of the script. In May 2015, following the apparent expiration of a development agreement with 20th Century Fox and Scott Free, Warner Bros. won the rights to the novel and planned to develop the project with writer Jon Spaihts and with Channing Tatum in a starring role.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Forever War title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database",

United States forces included 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment; 160th SOAR; Delta Force; 24th Special Tactics Squadron; DEVGRU Navy SEALs; 10th Mountain Division; as well as Malaysian and Pakistani United Nations peacekeeping forces.\nThe raid became the most intense close combat in U.S. military history since the Vietnam War. Although the overall mission to apprehend Aidid was officially codenamed Operation Gothic Serpent, the media colloquially termed the incident the Battle of Mogadishu as well as the Battle of the Black Sea.\n\n\n== History ==\nBlack Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War is based on a series of 29 articles written by journalist Mark Bowden for The Philadelphia Inquirer. He did extensive research in US Army records, interviewed participants from both sides of the conflict, reviewed footage recorded by observation aircraft, and listened to recordings of radio traffic. Before the book was published, Bowden's series had already begun to attract attention within the media. It consisted of a CD-ROM, an hour-long video, and an audiovisual series on The Inquirer's Web site. \nDelta Force member Paul R. Howe provided much of the information about the Delta force operations for the writing of the book. Bowden met with Howe in 1997 after clearing it with Howe's commanding officer. Other Delta Force members also consulted for the book, but did not allow the use of their real names. Howe has faced some criticism for allowing Bowden to use his real name.\nIn January 1991, militias overthrew the regime of President Siad Barre which led to the Somali Civil War. The United Nations later arranged a US-led intervention, with a mandate to engage in state building and encourage the militias to share power and begin to form a new government. \nPresident George H. W. Bush sent United States Marines into Somalia in December 1992 as part of a UN effort to secure transportation routes to deliver relief and food supplies, which had been disrupted by local militias. Uninterested in sharing power, Mohamed Farrah Aidid began to regard the ongoing UN mission as hostile and ambushed a peacekeeping convoy in June 1993, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers. \nThe UN mission's commander, U.S. Admiral Jonathan Howe, declared Aidid an outlaw, and the faction leader's forces and supporters subsequently began targeting the officer. The hunt for Aidid included a disputed attack on a house of clan officials and resulted in civilian casualties as well as increasing civilian hostility against the UN efforts, especially their use of helicopters. As a result, President Clinton approved Operation Gothic Serpent, a JSOC mission to apprehend Aidid. \nThe operation created Task Force Ranger which was composed of Rangers, Delta Force, 24th Special Tactics Squadron airmen, DEVGRU Navy SEALs, and 160th SOAR aviators. One of the operation's missions led to several Black Hawk helicopters being shot down and an extended bloody battle between task force and UN forces against Somali militia. \nAfter the battle, the hunt for Aidid was called off. The U.S. subsequently pulled out, with the UN following suit a few months later. In 1996, Aidid died from wounds sustained during a battle against a rival militia. A new interim central administration, the Transitional National Government, was eventually formed in 2000, a year after Bowden's book was published.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nBowden's narrative was generally praised, particularly his efforts at contextualizing the local and international politics and explaining how the peacekeeping mission devolved into armed conflict, later termed the \"Mogadishu Line\". A New York Times piece found he conveyed the battle as a gripping narrative, giving a minute-by-minute account of the United States campaign in Mogadishu, known as the Battle of the Black Sea. It added that Bowden rapidly shifts viewpoints after US ground forces enter the city, trying to extract a couple of Aidid leaders and then, when things go wrong, rescue US forces. Additionally, the piece remarked how Bowden simultaneously manages to capture the siege mentality felt by both civilians and the US soldiers, as well as the broad sentiment among many residents that the Rangers were to blame for the majority of the battle casualties.\nThe book was a finalist for the 1999 National Book Award for Nonfiction.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe story first ran on November 16, 1997, as a 29-part newspaper series that was then adapted to an online multimedia package, a first for The Philadelphia Inquirer. Bowden had amassed a large number of notes, audiotapes, documents, photos, and radio transcripts, and worked with the digital team at the Inquirer to post it online. At the time it served as one of the more innovative examples of multimedia storytelling by a news organization. The published online package contained videos, audio clips, graphics, maps, and links to external resources. \nThe book was accompanied by a video, Somalia: Good Intentions, Deadly Results, produced by KVR Video, that was aired on CNN on 24 March 1999 in a 57-minute version, as Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War; it later won an Emmy.\nThe book was adapted into a 2001 film, directed by Ridley Scott and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Mogadishu (1993)\nIn the Company of Heroes\nBlack Hawk Down (film)\nSurviving Black Hawk Down\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nBowden, Mark (1999).

It sold tens of millions of copies in eighteen different languages. It is based on interviews with a cross-section of participants, including U.S., Canadian, British, French and German officers and civilians.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nRyan received both financial and research assistance from the Reader's Digest, with excerpts from the book appearing in the Digest in June and July 1959. \nThe book begins and ends in the village of La Roche-Guyon. The book refers to the village as being the most occupied village in occupied France and states that for each of the 543 inhabitants of La Roche-Guyon there were more than three German soldiers in the village and surrounding area. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel commander-in-chief of Army Group B had his headquarters in the castle of the village which was the seat of the Duc de La Rochefoucauld.\nRyan's book is divided into three parts: the first part is titled \"The Wait\", the second part is named \"The Night\" and the third part is named \"The Day\". The book includes a section on the casualties of D-Day and also lists the contributors including their service details on the day of the invasion and their occupations at the time the book was first published. Ryan dedicated his book for all the men of D-Day.\nResearchers spent almost three years locating survivors of D-Day and over 3000 interviews were undertaken in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, France and Germany. 383 accounts of D-Day were used in the text of the book.\nSenior Allied officers who assisted the author included General Maxwell D. Taylor, Lieutenant General James M. Gavin, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick E. Morgan and General Sir Richard Nelson Gale. German officers who assisted with the book included Generaloberst Franz Halder, Hauptmann Hellmuth Lang and General der Infanterie Günther Blumentritt. The author also used Allied and German post action reports, war diaries, histories and official records.\nOn 6 June 1965, the author published an article \"More of The Longest Day\" in Reader's Digest as a supplement.\nEditor Peter Schwed gave the book its title from a comment made by the German field marshal Erwin Rommel to his aide Hauptmann Helmuth Lang on April 22, 1944: \"...the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive...the fate of Germany depends on the outcome...for the Allies, as well as Germany, it will be the longest day.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSimon & Schuster published The Longest Day: June 6, 1944 in November 1959 with a first printing of 85,000 copies. The book was reprinted numerous times as it spent twenty-two weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list\n\n\n== Adaptation ==\nIn 1962, the book was adapted into a Hollywood film of the same name.\nIn May 2014, publisher Andre Deutsch released the 70th Anniversary Collector's Edition, with the addition of 120 photographs, 30 unpublished removable facsimile documents from the Cornelius Ryan Archive and cover by Brazilian photographer Rodrigo Bressane, depicting an interpretation of the iconic Helmet in Omaha Beach, as seen on the Hollywood adaptation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Reporter who Time Forgot https://archives.cjr.org/second_read/the_reporter_who_time_forgot.php\nThe Ryan Collection in the Library of Trinity College Dublin contains several editions of The Longest Day",

After buying special leakproof tents, packs, a portable stove, packaged food, and other equipment, he and his old friend Stephen Katz start hiking the trail from Georgia in the South, and stumble in the beginning with the difficulties of getting used to their equipment; Bryson also soon realizes how difficult it is to travel with his friend, who is a crude, overweight recovering alcoholic, and even less prepared for the ordeal than he is. Overburdened, they soon discard much extra food and equipment to lighten their loads. They encounter other interesting hikers along the trail, some of them annoying, and one flirtatious obese woman at a laundromat.\nAfter hiking for what seemed to him a large distance, they realize they have still barely begun while in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and that the whole endeavor is simply too much for them. They skip a huge section of the trail, beginning again in Roanoke, Virginia. The book recounts Bryson's desire to seek easier terrain as well as \"a powerful urge not to be this far south any longer\". This section of the hike finally ends (after nearly 800 miles (1,300 km) of hiking) with Bryson going on a book tour and Katz returning to Des Moines, Iowa, to work.\nIn the following months Bryson continues to hike several smaller parts of the trail, including a visit to Centralia, Pennsylvania, the site of a coal seam fire, and eventually reunites with Katz to hike the Hundred-Mile Wilderness in Maine, which again proves too daunting. Ultimately Bryson hiked about 40% of the trail. In the 21st century, about 25% of thru-hike attempts are successful. Bryson quotes the older figure of 10%.\nAt the time of his attempt to hike the Appalachian Trail, Bryson was aged in his forties.\n\n\n== Writing process ==\nBryson admitted that he found the book hard to write, remarking in an interview that \"the thing about walking is that it's not eventful. It doesn't generate material. A long walk, a really long walk, is an exceedingly repetitious experience...when I finally got a book out of it, I was kind of astounded.\" He described himself as \"wretchedly homesick\" during his hike and that he had had to fictionalize some of Angerer's behavior, as \"he was quite depressed at this time...he just felt like life had kicked him in the balls and he wasn’t doing very well. And I portrayed all of that. And it was just depressing...my revelation with that was, instead of making him just depressed, I just made him angry, which he also was. I made it much more that he was angry with the trail rather than angry with life...so it really became the two of us against the trail. And then it started to work much better, I think, as a narrative.\"\nWhilst pleased with his accomplishments on the Trail, Bryson expressed regret that he and Angerer had not completed the 100-Mile Wilderness section. He also identified the Berkshires as the part of the Trail that he would most like to re-hike.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nIn 2005, Robert Redford announced, and later confirmed, that he would star in and produce an adaptation of Bryson's book into a film, and that he would play Bryson. He also hoped that his erstwhile co-star and friend, Paul Newman, would team up with him to play the role of Katz, although he jokingly expressed doubt as to whether the health-conscious Newman would consider putting on enough weight to accurately portray the rotund Katz. However, Newman retired from acting in May 2007 and died in 2008.\nIn February 2007, Chris Columbus, director of Home Alone and the first two Harry Potter films, was reported to have agreed to direct the adaptation. However, in January 2008, the Hollywood Reporter, while noting that the script was delayed due to the Hollywood writers' strike, reported that Barry Levinson, the Academy Award–winning director of Rain Man, was in talks to direct.\nRedford has said of the project\n\nIt'll be fun. I don't know when I've read a book that I laughed so loud. Also, it's a chance to take a look at the country ... The backdrop is pretty terrific, if you stop to think of all the visuals that are possible as they go along that trail.\nIn February 2012, it was reported that novelist Richard Russo, during a speech at Union College, confirmed that he was working on the screenplay.\nBy November 2013, Nick Nolte had been cast to costar as Katz. Larry Charles (of Borat and Brüno) was briefly attached as director, but eventually the job went to Ken Kwapis, whose most recent film was Big Miracle and who was a key figure on the U.S. television series The Office. The screenplay was by Michael Arndt, credited as Rick Kerb, and Bill Holderman, who is a producer at Redford's Wildwood Enterprises. Shooting began in spring 2014. The movie was largely filmed at Amicalola Falls State Park, in Dawsonville, Georgia, including scenes at The Lodge at Amicalola Falls.\nThe film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2015, and was released in theaters on September 2, 2015, by Broad Green Pictures.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA Walk In the Woods was named by CNN as the funniest travel book ever written. A review in The New York Times stated that readers, \"may find themselves turning the pages with increasing amusement and anticipation as they discover that they're in the hands of a satirist of the first rank\". The New Yorker described the book as a \"wry, well-researched account\".\nThe book was met with anger amongst some members of the Appalachian Trail community, with letters to the Appalachian Trailway News, a newsletter of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, excoriating Bryson for his perceived cynicism, ill-informed complaints and demeaning portrayal of Southerners. Despite this, it has been credited with a 50% increase in long-distance hiker numbers during the two years after publication.\nAngerer claimed in a 2015 interview with the Des Moines Register that the book was \"true for the most part\", but disagreed with Bryson's portrayal of his initial physical fitness and thought that his purported womanizing had been exaggerated. He died in June 2023 at the age of 71.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nISBN 0-7679-0251-3. Hardback. Published by Broadway Books, on May 4, 1998.\nISBN 0-7679-0252-1. Paperback.

It was also published as part of Walk About, which included Down Under and another of Bryson's books, A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, in one volume.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nBill Bryson describes his travels by railway and car throughout Australia, his conversations with people in all walks of life about the history, geography, unusual plants and animals of the country, and his wry impressions of the life, culture and amenities (or lack thereof) in each locality.\nIn a style similar to his book A Walk in the Woods, or William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways, Bryson's research enabled him to include many stories about Australia's 19th-century explorers and settlers who suffered extreme deprivations, as well as details about its natural resources, culture, and economy. His writings are intertwined with recurring humorous themes.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book consists of three parts:\n1. Into the Outback\nThe first part of the book mainly describes the journey taken by Bryson aboard the Indian Pacific from Sydney to Perth. He is accompanied on this journey by a young English photographer named Trevor Ray Hart. The author describes his experiences on the train, the places the train passes through on its way to Perth such as the Blue Mountains and White Cliffs. The author also supplies plenty of humor in the form of historical accounts of early explorers and settlers of Australia.\n\n2. Civilized Australia (The Boomerang Coast)\nThis section of the book starts off with historical accounts from the time when Australia was discovered and goes on to illustrate how the Australians built a dynamic and prosperous society from a modest and unpropitious beginning. The rest of this section is devoted to the author's account of what he considers to be Civilized Australia, with accounts of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra, the Gold Coast, Surfers Paradise, and many countryside towns in between.\n3. Around the Edges\nThis part of the journey covers the Great Barrier Reef, the cities of Cairns, Darwin, and Alice Springs, and the mighty monolithic rock Uluru.  Later Bryson visits Perth and the Shark Bay area of Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "description": "Endurance (also related to sufferance, forbearance, resilience, constitution, fortitude, persistence, tenacity, steadfastness, perseverance, stamina, and hardiness) is the ability of an organism to exert itself and remain active for a long period of time, as well as its ability to resist, withstand, recover from and have immunity to trauma, wounds, or fatigue.\nThe term is often used in the context of aerobic or anaerobic exercise. The definition of \"long\" varies according to the type of exertion – minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can reduce endurance strength unless an individual also undertakes resistance training to counteract this effect.\nWhen a person is able to accomplish or withstand more effort than previously, their endurance is increasing. To improve their endurance they may slowly increase the amount of repetitions or time spent; in some exercises, more repetitions taken rapidly improve muscle strength but have less effect on endurance. Increasing endurance has been proven to release endorphins resulting in a positive mind. The act of gaining endurance through physical activity decreases anxiety, depression, and stress, or any chronic disease. Although a greater endurance can assist the cardiovascular system this does not imply that endurance is guaranteed to improve any cardiovascular disease. \"The major metabolic consequences of the adaptations of muscle to endurance exercise are a slower utilization of muscle glycogen and blood glucose, a greater reliance on fat oxidation, and less lactate production during exercise of a given intensity.\"\nThe term stamina is sometimes used synonymously and interchangeably with endurance. Endurance may also refer to an ability to persevere through a difficult situation, to \"endure hardship\".\nIn military settings, endurance is the ability of a force to sustain high levels of combat potential relative to its opponent over the duration of a campaign.",

Endurance may also refer to an ability to persevere through a difficult situation, to \"endure hardship\".\nIn military settings, endurance is the ability of a force to sustain high levels of combat potential relative to its opponent over the duration of a campaign.\n\n\n== Philosophy ==\nAristotle noted similarities between endurance and self control: To have self control is to resist the temptation of things that seem immediately appealing, while to endure is to resist the discouragement of things that seem immediately uncomfortable.\n\n\n== Endurance training ==\n\nDifferent types of endurance performance can be trained in specific ways. Adaptation of exercise plans should follow individual goals.\nCalculating the intensity of exercise the individual capabilities should be considered. Effective training starts within half the individual performance capability. Performance capability is expressed by maximum heart rate. Best results can be achieved in the range between 55% and 65% of maximum heart rate. Aerobic, anaerobic and further thresholds are not to be mentioned within extensive endurance exercises. Training intensity is measured via the heart rate.\n\n\n=== Endurance-trained effects are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms ===\nBetween 2012 and 2019 at least 25 reports indicated a major role of epigenetic mechanisms in skeletal muscle responses to exercise.\n\nGene expression in muscle is largely regulated, as in tissues generally, by regulatory DNA sequences, especially enhancers. Enhancers are non-coding sequences in the genome that activate the expression of distant target genes, by looping around and interacting with the promoters of their target genes (see Figure \"Regulation of transcription in mammals\"). As reported by Williams et al., the average distance in the loop between the connected enhancers and promoters of genes is 239,000 nucleotide bases.\n\n\n==== Endurance exercise-induced long-term alteration of gene expression by histone acetylation or deacetylation ====\n\nAfter exercise, epigenetic alterations to enhancers alter long-term expression of hundreds of muscle genes. This includes genes producing proteins and other products secreted into the systemic circulation, many of which may act as endocrine messengers. Of 817 genes with altered expression, 157 (according to Uniprot) or 392 (according to Exocarta) of the proteins produced according to those genes were known to be secreted from the muscles. Four days after an endurance type of exercise, many genes have persistently altered epigenetically regulated expression. Four pathways altered were in the platelet/coagulation system, the cognitive system, the cardiovascular system, and the renal system. Epigenetic regulation of these genes was indicated by epigenetic alterations in the distant upstream DNA regulatory sequences of the enhancers of these genes. \nUp-regulated genes had epigenetic acetylations added at histone 3 lysine 27 (H3k27ac) of nucleosomes located at the enhancers controlling those up-regulated genes, while down-regulated genes had epigenetic acetylations removed from H3K27 in nucleosomes located at the enhancers that control those genes (see Figure \"A nucleosome with histone tails set for transcriptional activation\"). Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle showed expression of 13,108 genes at baseline before an exercise training program. Six sedentary 23-year-old Caucasian males provided vastus lateralis biopsies before entering an exercise program (six weeks of 60-minute sessions of riding a stationary cycle, five days per week). Four days after the exercise program was completed, biopsies of the same muscles had altered gene expression, with 641 genes up-regulated and 176 genes down-regulated. Williams et al. identified 599 enhancer-gene interactions, covering 491 enhancers and 268 genes, where both the enhancer and the connected target gene were coordinately either upregulated or downregulated after exercise training.\n\n\n==== Endurance exercise-induced alteration to gene expression by DNA methylation or demethylation ====\nEndurance muscle training also alters muscle gene expression through epigenetic DNA methylation or de-methylation of CpG sites within enhancers.  In a study by Lindholm et al., twenty-three 27-year-old, sedentary, male and female volunteers had endurance training on only one leg during three months. The other leg was used as an untrained control leg. Skeletal muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken both before training began and 24 hours after the last training session from each of the legs. The endurance-trained leg, compared to the untrained leg, had significant DNA methylation changes at 4,919 sites across the genome. The sites of altered DNA methylation were predominantly in enhancers. Transcriptional analysis, using RNA sequencing, identified 4,076 differentially expressed genes.   \nThe transcriptionally upregulated genes were associated with enhancers that had a significant decrease in DNA methylation, while transcriptionally downregulated genes were associated with enhancers that had increased DNA methylation. In this study, the differentially methylated positions in enhancers with increased methylation were mainly associated with genes involved in structural remodeling of the muscle and glucose metabolism. The differentially decreased methylated positions in enhancers were associated with genes functioning in inflammatory/immunological processes and transcriptional regulation.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nExercise\n\n\n== References ==",

    "full_narrative": "Shadow Divers: The True Adventure of Two Americans Who Risked Everything to Solve One of the Last Mysteries of World War II is a 2004 non-fiction book by Robert Kurson recounting of the discovery of a World War II German U-boat 60 miles (97 km) off the coast of New Jersey, United States in 1991, exploration dives, and its eventual identification as U-869 lost on 11 February 1945.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn 1991, a group of divers, including John Chatterton, set out on Seeker to explore an unknown object lying 230 feet (70 m) below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean and discover a World War II German U-boat off the coast of New Jersey. Amazed at this discovery, Chatterton and his fellow divers make a pact to keep the U-boat a secret until they can discover its identity and claim credit for its discovery. This is to prevent \"wreck-jumping\" (wherein another person claims credit and/or removes objects from the wreck). Unfortunately, this pact is broken almost immediately by team members who tell close friends, and the secret is let out. Consulting both the United States Navy and the German Navy yields denials of the possibility of a World War II-era U-boat wreck in that area. Historical records claim the closest U-boat wreck to be hundreds of miles away.\nThe book chronicles the quest to learn the identity of the mysterious wreck, dubbed U-Who by the dive team, the identities of the men aboard her, and how she came to rest on the ocean floor near New Jersey. It took six years of dives to retrieve artifacts from the submarine plus research to confirm the boat's identity as U-869.\nOver the length of the quest several members of the original dive team quit, either because their lives lead them elsewhere or over concerns for their safety. Several new members were brought in, including Richie Kohler, a member of the notorious \"Atlantic Wreck Divers\" club that had the reputation of being pirate-like and reckless in their diving philosophy. This philosophy is the complete opposite of Chatterton's, and Chatterton initially dislikes Kohler. However, during the course of the quest the two men discover qualities in each other they both admire and respect. Kohler himself is driven not by monetary desires but the history behind the wreck, and the personal connection he feels as his family is of German descent. He and Chatterton ultimately become close friends.\nThe quest for the identity of the U-boat and its occupants pushes the dive team to the limits, ultimately ending Chatterton's and Kohler's marriages, and the lives of three divers, including Steve Feldman, and the father-son team Chris Rouse, Sr. and Chris \"Chrisy\" Rouse, Jr.\n\n\n== In media ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nGary Gentile's self-published, non-fiction book Shadow Divers Exposed: the Real Saga of the U-869 (2006) challenges some of the facts about the sinking of U-869. Gentile, a noted wreck diver, researcher, and author, sharply refutes Chatterton and Kohler's theory of how U-869 sank.  Gentile cites attack logs and eyewitness accounts from the crew of two destroyer escorts that suggest the U-boat was initially damaged with a hedgehog launched by USS Howard D. Crow and then subsequently damaged with a depth charge by the accompanying USS Koiner. Gentile also contradicts the events on deck after the Rouses' fatal dive.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe PBS NOVA episode, \"Hitler's Lost Sub\" (November 14, 2000), followed Chatterton and Kohler in their quest to identify the sub.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nMusician Adam Young of the group Owl City wrote the song \"Brielle\" after having read Shadow Divers: \"Brielle is a little town on the coast of New Jersey. I wrote the song after reading Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson in which he recounts the discovery of a World War II German U-boat sixty miles off the U.S. coast in 1991. The song describes a sailor who is about to leave on a long trip and wonders whether he will ever see the girl he loves again.\"\n\n\n== Honors ==\nAmerican Booksellers Association's Non-fiction 2005 Book Sense Book of the Year Award\nAmerican Library Association Alex Award, 2005\nNew York Times Best Seller list\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Last Dive: A Father and Son's Fatal Descent into the Ocean's Depths Bernie Chowdhury.

    "full_narrative": "The Gulag Archipelago: An Experiment in Literary Investigation (Russian: Архипелаг ГУЛАГ, romanized: Arkhipelag GULAG) is a three-volume nonfiction series written between 1958 and 1968 by Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a Soviet dissident. It was first published in 1973 by the Parisian publisher YMCA-Press, and it was translated into English and French the following year. It explores a vision of life in what is often known as the Gulag, the Soviet labour camp system. Solzhenitsyn constructed his highly detailed narrative from various sources including reports, interviews, statements, diaries, legal documents, and his own experience as a Gulag prisoner. \nFollowing its publication, the book was initially circulated in the Soviet Union by samizdat underground publication. It was not widely published there until 1989. It appeared that year in the literary journal Novy Mir; a third of the work was published in three issues. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, The Gulag Archipelago has been officially published in Russia.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nAs structured in most printed editions, the text comprises seven sections divided into three volumes: parts 1 and 2, parts 3 and 4, and parts 5 to 7. At one level, the Gulag Archipelago traces the history of the system of forced labor camps that operated in the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1956. Solzhenitsyn begins with Vladimir Lenin's original decrees that were made shortly after the October Revolution; they established the legal and practical framework for a series of camps where political prisoners and ordinary criminals would be sentenced to forced labor.Note 2\nThe book describes and discusses the waves of purges and the assembling of show trials by Stalin through the 1930s in the context of the development of the greater Gulag system; Solzhenitsyn closely examines its purposive legal and bureaucratic development. The narrative ends in 1956 at the time of Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech (\"On the Personality Cult and its Consequences\"). Khrushchev gave the speech at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, denouncing Joseph Stalin's personality cult, his autocratic power, and the widespread surveillance of all classes of people that pervaded the Stalin era.\nParallel to this historical and legal narrative, Solzhenitsyn follows the typical course of a zek through the Gulag. This was a slang term for an inmate, derived from the widely used abbreviation z/k for zakliuchenny (\"prisoner\"). He started with arrest, show trial, and initial internment, continuing with the transport to the Gulag. In that setting, he explored the treatment of prisoners and their general living conditions, slave labor gangs and the technical prison camp system, camp rebellions and strikes, such as the Kengir uprising; the practice of continued internal exile following the completion of the original prison sentence, and the ultimate but not guaranteed release of the prisoner, if one survived. Solzhenitsyn's examination details the trivial and commonplace events of an average prisoner's life, as well as specific and noteworthy events during the history of the Gulag system, including revolts and uprisings.\n\n\n== Thesis ==\nAt Chapter 4, Solzhenitsyn writes: \"Macbeth’s self-justifications were feeble – and his conscience devoured him. Yes, even Iago was a little lamb, too. The imagination and spiritual strength of Shakespeare's evildoers stopped short at a dozen corpses. Because they had no ideology. Ideology – that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others' eyes.... That was how the agents of the Inquisition fortified their wills: by invoking Christianity; the conquerors of foreign lands, by extolling the grandeur of their Motherland; the colonizers, by civilization; the Nazis, by race; and the Jacobins (early and late), by equality, brotherhood, and the happiness of future generations... Without evildoers there would have been no Archipelago.\"\nSolzhenitsyn painstakingly laid the theoretical, legal, and practical origins of the Gulag system at Lenin's feet, not Stalin's. According to Solzhenitsyn's testimony, Stalin amplified a concentration camp system that was already in place and this was significant because he said many Western intellectuals considered the Soviet prison camp system to be a Stalinist aberration.\nSolzhenitsyn claims that although many practices had been stopped, the basic structure of the system had survived and it could be revived and expanded by future leaders. While Khrushchev, the Communist Party, and the Soviet Union's supporters in the West viewed the Gulag as a deviation of Stalin, Solzhenitsyn and others among the opposition tended to view it as a systemic fault of Soviet political culture, and an inevitable outcome of the Bolshevik political project.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nAfter the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965–1967, he worked to develop his preparatory drafts of The Gulag Archipelago into finished typescript. He accomplished some of this while in hiding at his friends' homes in the Moscow region and elsewhere.\nWhile held at the KGB's Lubyanka Prison in 1945, Solzhenitsyn had befriended Arnold Susi, a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education, who had been taken captive after the Soviet Union occupied Estonia in 1944. Solzhenitsyn entrusted Susi with the original typed and proofread manuscript of the finished work, after copies had been made of it both on paper and on microfilm. Susi got the manuscript to his daughter, Heli Susi, who kept the \"master copy\" hidden from the KGB in Estonia until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nIn 1973, the KGB seized one of only three existing copies of the text still on Soviet soil. This was achieved by interrogating Elizaveta Voronyanskaya, one of Solzhenitsyn's trusted typists who knew where the typed copy was hidden. Within days of her release by the KGB she was found hanged in the stairwell of her apartment on the 3rd of August 1973. She had apparently either hanged herself or been murdered. Solzhenitsyn had wanted the manuscript to be first published in Russia, but knew this was impossible under conditions then extant. After Solzhenitsyn learned of Voronyanskaya's death he decided to allow its publication in Paris. The first edition of the work was published in Russian by the Parisian publishing house YMCA-Press (founded by Russian immigrants) a few days after Christmas 1973. They had received a go-ahead from Solzhenitsyn but had decided to release the work about ten days earlier than he had expected. News of the nature of the work immediately caused a stir, and translations into many other languages followed within the next few months, sometimes produced in a race against time. American Thomas P. Whitney produced the English version. The English and French translations of Volume I appeared in the spring and summer of 1974.\nThe work had a profound effect internationally. Not only did it provoke energetic debate in the West; a mere six weeks after the work had left Parisian presses Solzhenitsyn himself was forced into exile. Because possession of the manuscript incurred the risk of a long prison sentence for \"anti-Soviet activities\", Solzhenitsyn never worked on the manuscript in complete form. Since he was under constant KGB surveillance, Solzhenitsyn worked on only parts of the manuscript at any one time, so as not to put the full book into jeopardy if he happened to be arrested.\nFor this reason, he secreted the various parts of the work throughout Moscow and the surrounding suburbs, in the care of trusted friends. Sometimes when he was purportedly visiting them on social calls he actually worked on the manuscript in their homes. During much of this time, Solzhenitsyn lived at the dacha of the world-famous cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, and due to the reputation and standing of the musician, despite the elevated scrutiny of the Soviet authorities, Solzhenitsyn was reasonably safe from KGB searches there.\nWith the possible exception of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, it is his best-known and most popular work, at least in the West. Finished in 1968, The Gulag Archipelago was microfilmed and smuggled out to Solzhenitsyn's main legal representative, Fritz Heeb of Zürich, to await publication; a later paper copy, also smuggled out, was signed by Heinrich Böll at the foot of each page to prove against possible accusations of a falsified work. Solzhenitsyn was aware that there was a wealth of material and perspectives about Gulag to be continued in the future, but he considered the book finished for his part. The royalties and sales income for the book were transferred to the Solzhenitsyn Aid Fund for aid to former camp prisoners. His fund, (The Russian Social Fund), which had to work in secret in its native country, managed to transfer substantial amounts of money towards helping former gulag prisoners in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\n== Reception and impact ==\nBeginning in 2009, Russian schools issued the book as required reading. Russian president Vladimir Putin called the book \"much-needed\", while the Russian Ministry of Education said that the book showed  \"vital historical and cultural heritage on the course of 20th-century domestic history.\" Arseny Roginsky, the then head of the human-rights organization Memorial, welcomed Putin's backing for the Solzhenitsyn textbook.\nNatalya Reshetovskaya described her ex-husband's book as \"folklore\", telling a newspaper in 1974 that she felt the book was \"not in fact the life of the country and not even the life of the camps but the folklore of the camps.\" In her 1974 memoir, Reshetovskaya wrote that Solzhenitsyn did not consider the novel to be \"historical research, or scientific research\", and stated that the significance of the novel had been \"overestimated and wrongly appraised.\" Reshetovskaya created an abridged version for Russian high-school students, including an introduction about the nature of Solzhenitsyn's \"experiment in literary investigation.\" Her books were published by the Novosti Press, a state-run media  founded by the USSR Council of People's Commissars and the Communist Party Central Committee. Her editor there was Konstantin Semyonov, and he became her third husband.\n\n\n=== Academic ===\nHistorian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft described the book as \"a fine literary masterpiece, a sharp political indictment against the Soviet regime, and has had tremendous importance in raising the issue of Soviet repression in the Russian consciousness.\" Wheatcroft wrote that the book was essentially a \"literary and political work\", and \"never claimed to place the camps in a historical or social-scientific quantitative perspective\" but that in the case of qualitative estimates, Solzhenitsyn gave his inaccurately high estimate as he wanted to challenge the Soviet authorities to show that \"the scale of the camps was less than this.\" Wheatcroft stated that historians relied on Solzhenitsyn to support their estimates of deaths under Stalin in the tens of millions but research in the state archives vindicated the lower estimates, while adding that the popular press has continued to include serious errors that should not be cited, or relied on, in academia.\"\nUCLA historian J. Arch Getty wrote of Solzhenitsyn's methodology that \"such documentation is methodologically unacceptable in other fields of history\" and that \"the work is of limited value to the serious student of the 1930s for it provides no important new information or original analytical framework. Gabor Rittersporn shared Getty's criticism, saying that \"he is inclined to give priority to vague reminiscences and hearsay ... [and] inevitably [leads] towards selective bias\", adding that \"one might dwell at length on the inaccuracies discernible in Solzhenitsyn’s work\". Vadim Rogovin writes of the eyewitness accounts that Solzhenitsyn had read, saying he \"took plenty of license in outlining their contents and interpreting them\". Both Rogovin and Walter Laquer argue that the book belongs to the genre of 'oral history'.\nIn an interview with the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit, British historian Orlando Figes stated that many Gulag inmates he interviewed for his research identified so strongly with the book's contents that they became unable to distinguish between their own experiences and what they read: \"The Gulag Archipelago spoke for a whole nation and was the voice of all those who suffered.\" Soviet dissident and historian Roy Medvedev referred to the book as \"extremely contradictory\". In a review for the book, Medvedev described it as without parallel for its impact, saying: \"I believe there are few who will get up from their desks after reading this book the same as when they opened its first page. In this regard I have nothing with which to compare Solzhenitsyn's book either in Russian or world literature.\" In the same review, he also writes that \"This book is full of thoughts and observations, some profound and true, others perhaps not always true but born in the monstrous sufferings of tens of millions of persons.\"\n\n\n=== Popular press ===\nNovelist Doris Lessing said that the book \"brought down an empire\", while author Michael Scammell described the book as a gesture that \"amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state, calling its very legitimacy into question and demanding revolutionary change.\" About its impact, philosopher Isaiah Berlin wrote: \"Until the Gulag, the Communists and their allies had persuaded their followers that denunciations of the regime were largely bourgeois propaganda.\" United States diplomat George F. Kennan said that the book was \"the most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be levied in modern times.\"\nAuthor Tom Butler-Bowdon has described the book as a \"Solzhenitsyn's monument to the millions tortured and murdered in Soviet Russia between the Bolshevik Revolution and the 1950s.\" An edition of The Book Show said that the book helped expose the brutality of the Soviet system. Psychologist Jordan Peterson, who wrote the foreword of an abridged fiftieth anniversary edition released on 1 November 2018, described The Gulag Archipelago as the most important book of the twentieth century.\nParallels have been drawn between the book and the treatment of Liao Yiwu, a dissident who is dubbed \"the Chinese Solzhenitsyn\" according to the Agence France-Presse. Author David Aikman stated that Liao is the first Chinese dissident writer to \"come up with a very detailed account of prison conditions including torture in China in the same way that [Soviet dissident Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn did in The Gulag Archipelago.\"\n\n\n== Television documentary ==\nIn December 2009, the Russian channel Rossiya K showed the French television documentary L'Histoire Secrète de l'Archipel du Goulag made by Jean Crépu and Nicolas Miletitch, and translated it into Russian under the title Taynaya Istoriya \"Arkhipelaga GULAG\" (Secret History: The Gulag Archipelago). The documentary covers events related to the writing and publication of The Gulag Archipelago.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Master and Margarita\nArt and culture in the Gulag labor camps\nArticle 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)\nThe Black Book of Communism\nBlack site\nCrimes against humanity under communist regimes\nCriticism of communist party rule\nHuman rights in the Soviet Union\nLe Monde's 100 Books of the Century\nJulius Margolin\nMass killings under communist regimes\nNikolai Trifonov\nThe Stalinist Legacy\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n1.^  In Russian, the term GULAG (ГУЛАГ) is an acronym for Main Directorate of Camps (Главное управление лагерей).\n2.^  A similar (but on vastly smaller scale) network of forced labour camps, known as katorga, existed in the Russian Empire since the early 18th century.

Since the Spanish transition to democracy, some historians have cautioned against reading Orwell's first-person account as a representation of the conflict as a whole.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Historical context ===\nDuring the 19th century, a motif known as the two Spains began to emerge in Spanish literature, in which writers such as Mariano José de Larra depicted a polarised Spain, divided into progressive and conservative factions. When the Second Spanish Republic was established in 1931, it came at a time when Europe was experiencing a rise in far-right politics, including fascism and Nazism. The Spanish Civil War broke out on 18 July 1936, when the Nationalist faction of the Spanish Army, supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, launched a coup d'état against the elected government of the Spanish Republic. \n\nAs the Republican government was initially paralysed by the coup, resistance to it was organised by the general population in cities throughout the country, culminating in a social revolution that saw anarchist and socialist workers bring Spain's industrial economy under social ownership. By the autumn of 1936, workers' militias had defeated the Nationalist coup in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, forming a frontline through Aragon and New Castile that divided Spain into Republican and Nationalist zones. The Republican faction consisted of several different political parties and trade unions, of varying political positions and influence, including: the National Confederation of Labour (CNT), an anarchist trade union which controlled the Barcelona metropolitan area; the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), a small Trotskyist party; the General Union of Workers (UGT), a socialist trade union which predominated in Bilbao and Madrid; and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and Communist Party of Spain (PCE), which had amalgamated together in Catalonia into the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC).\nThe French government of Léon Blum and the British government of Neville Chamberlain adopted a policy of non-intervention, ostensibly to prevent any escalation, but also motivated by their fear of revolutionary sentiments spreading outside of Spain. While the Nationalists were supported militarily from the Nazis and fascists, the Republicans found themselves economically and diplomatically isolated, forcing them to purchase military equipment from the Soviet Union. In order to combat the rise of fascism and defend the social revolution, thousands of volunteers came to Spain and joined the Republican militias.\n\n\n=== Biographical context ===\n\nGeorge Orwell was born in 1903, in the Indian city of Motihari, which was at the time under the rule of the British Raj. He was raised by his mother in England and returned to Asia at the age of 19, in order to join the Imperial Police in Burma. There he was exposed first-hand to the material realities of imperialism, which became the subject of his first novel Burmese Days, published in 1934. Upon his return to Europe, he spent years living in poverty in the cities of London and Paris, an experience which formed the basis for his first full-length work Down and Out in Paris and London. By the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Orwell was already a committed anti-capitalist.\nThroughout the 1930s, Orwell had become concerned about the rise of fascism in Europe and wanted to take action to oppose it. Although he did not speak or write about Spain during the first months of the conflict, so his thought process on the matter is not known, by the autumn of 1936, he had decided to go to Spain. In order to obtain a passport that would permit his entry into Spain, he initially went to the headquarters of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in London's King Street. When the party's leader, Harry Pollitt, asked if he would join the International Brigades, Orwell replied that he wanted to see for himself what was happening first. After Pollitt refused to help, Orwell contacted the Independent Labour Party (ILP). They accredited Orwell as a correspondent for their weekly paper, the New Leader, which provided Orwell the means to go legitimately to Spain. Orwell received a letter of recommendation from the ILP's general secretary Fenner Brockway, who put him in touch with John McNair, the ILP's representative in Barcelona and an affiliate of the POUM, a Catalan party of the anti-Stalinist left. \nAfter putting the finishing touches on his book The Road to Wigan Pier, he departed for Spain on 23 December 1936. He briefly stopped in Paris, where he met up with his friend Henry Miller, before he continued his journey south by train, finally crossing over the France–Spain border and arriving in Barcelona by the end of the year.\nUpon arriving in Spain, Orwell is reported to have told McNair that he had come to Spain to join the militia to fight against Fascism. While McNair also describes Orwell as expressing a desire to write \"some articles\" for the New Statesman and Nation with an intention \"to stir working-class opinion in Britain and France\", when presented the opportunity to write, Orwell told him writing \"was quite secondary and his main reason for coming was to fight against Fascism.\" McNair took Orwell to the POUM (Catalan: Partit Obrer d'Unificació Marxista; English: Workers' Party of Marxist Unification), an anti-Stalinist communist party.\nBy Orwell's own admission, it was somewhat by chance that he joined the POUM: \"I knew that I was serving in something called the POUM. (I had only joined the POUM militia rather than any other because I happened to arrive in Barcelona with ILP papers), but I did not realize that there were serious differences between the political parties.\" He later notes, \"As far as my purely personal preferences went I would have liked to join the Anarchists.\" He also nearly joined Communist International's International Column midway through his tour because he thought they were likeliest to send him to Madrid, where he wanted to join the action.\n\n\n== Chapter summaries ==\nThe appendices in this summary correspond to chapters 5 and 11 in editions that do not include appendices. Orwell felt these chapters, as journalistic accounts of the political situation in Spain, were out of place in the midst of the narrative and should be moved so that readers could ignore them if they wished.\n\n\n=== Chapter one ===\nOrwell describes the atmosphere of Barcelona in December 1936. \"The anarchists were still in virtual control of Catalonia and the revolution was still in full swing ... It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle ... every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle ... every shop and café had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized.\" Further to this, \"The Anarchists\" (referring to the Spanish CNT and FAI) were \"in control\", tipping was prohibited by workers themselves, and servile forms of speech, such as \"Señor\" or \"Don\", were abandoned. At the Lenin Barracks (formerly the Lepanto Barracks), militiamen were given instruction in the form of \"parade-ground drill of the most antiquated, stupid kind; right turn, left turn, about turn, marching at attention in column of threes and all the rest of that useless nonsense, which I had learned when I was fifteen years old\".\n\nHe describes the deficiencies of the POUM workers' militia, the absence of weapons, the recruits mostly boys of sixteen or seventeen ignorant of the meaning of war, half-complains about the sometimes frustrating tendency of Spaniards to put things off until \"mañana\" (tomorrow), notes his struggles with Spanish (or more usually, the local use of Catalan). He praises the generosity of the Catalan working class. Orwell leads to the next chapter by describing the \"conquering-hero stuff\"—parades through the streets and cheering crowds—that the militiamen experienced at the time he was sent to the Aragón front.\n\n\n=== Chapter two ===\nIn January 1937, Orwell's centuria arrives in Alcubierre, just behind the line fronting Zaragoza. He sketches the squalor of the region's villages and the \"Fascist deserters\" indistinguishable from themselves. On the third day rifles are handed out. Orwell's \"was a German Mauser dated 1896 ... it was corroded and past praying for.\" The chapter ends on his centuria's arrival at trenches near Zaragoza and the first time a bullet nearly hit him. To his dismay, instinct made him duck.\n\n\n=== Chapter three ===\nIn the hills around Zaragoza, Orwell experiences the \"mingled boredom and discomfort of stationary warfare,\" the mundaneness of a situation in which \"each army had dug itself in and settled down on the hill-tops it had won.\" He praises the Spanish militias for their relative social equality, for their holding of the front while the army was trained in the rear, and for the \"democratic 'revolutionary' type of discipline ... more reliable than might be expected.\" \"'Revolutionary' discipline depends on political consciousness—on an understanding of why orders must be obeyed; it takes time to diffuse this, but it also takes time to drill a man into an automaton on the barrack-square\".\nThroughout the chapter Orwell describes the various shortages and problems at the front—firewood (\"We were between two and three thousand feet above sea-level, it was mid winter and the cold was unspeakable\"), food, candles, tobacco, and adequate munitions—as well as the danger of accidents inherent in a badly trained and poorly armed group of soldiers.\n\n\n=== Chapter four ===\nAfter some three weeks at the front, Orwell and the other English militiaman in his unit, Williams, join a contingent of fellow Englishmen sent out by the Independent Labour Party to a position at Monte Oscuro, within sight of Zaragoza. \"Perhaps the best of the bunch was Bob Smillie—the grandson of the famous miners' leader—who afterwards died such an evil and meaningless death in Valencia\". In this new position he witnesses the sometimes propagandistic shouting between the Rebel and Loyalist trenches and hears of the fall of Málaga. \"... every man in the militia believed that the loss of Malaga was due to treachery. It was the first talk I had heard of treachery or divided aims. It set up in my mind the first vague doubts about this war in which, hitherto, the rights and wrongs had seemed so beautifully simple.\"  In February, he is sent with the other POUM militiamen 50 miles to make a part of the army besieging Huesca; he mentions the running joke phrase, \"Tomorrow we'll have coffee in Huesca,\" attributed to a general commanding the Government troops who, months earlier, made one of many failed assaults on the town.\n\n\n=== Chapter five (orig. ch. 6) ===\nOrwell complains that on the eastern side of Huesca, where he was stationed, nothing ever seemed to happen—except the onslaught of spring, and, with it, lice. He was in a (\"so-called\") hospital at Monflorite for ten days at the end of March 1937 with a poisoned hand that had to be lanced and put in a sling. He describes rats that \"really were as big as cats, or nearly\" (in Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, the protagonist Winston Smith has a phobia of rats that Orwell himself shared to a lesser degree). He makes reference to the lack of \"religious feeling, in the orthodox sense,\" and that the Catholic Church was, \"to the Spanish people, at any rate in Catalonia and Aragon, a racket, pure and simple. And possibly Christian belief was replaced to some extent by Anarchism\". The latter portion of the chapter briefly details various operations in which Orwell took part: silently advancing the Loyalist frontline by night, for example.\n\n\n=== Chapter six (orig. ch. 7) ===\nOrwell takes part in a \"holding attack\" on Huesca, designed to draw the Nationalist troops away from an Anarchist attack on \"the Jaca road.\" He suspects two of the bombs he threw may have killed their targets, but he cannot be sure. They capture the position and pull back with captured rifles and ammunition, but Orwell laments that they fled too hurriedly to bring back a telescope they had discovered, which Orwell sees as more useful than any weapons.\n\n\n=== Chapter seven (orig. ch. 8) ===\nOrwell shares memories of the 115 days he spent on the war front, and its influence on his political ideas, \"... the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism ... the ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England ... the effect was to make my desire to see Socialism established much more actual than it had been before.\" By the time he left Spain, he had become a \"convinced democratic Socialist.\" The chapter ends with Orwell's arrival in Barcelona on the afternoon of 26 April 1937. \"And after that the trouble began.\"\n\n\n=== Chapter eight (orig. ch. 9) ===\n\nOrwell details noteworthy changes in the social and political atmosphere of Barcelona when he returns after three months at the front. He describes a lack of revolutionary atmosphere and the class division that he had thought would not reappear, i.e., with visible division between rich and poor and the return of servile language. Orwell had been determined to leave the POUM, and confesses here that he \"would have liked to join the Anarchists,\" but instead sought a recommendation to join the International Column, so that he could go to the Madrid front. The latter half of this chapter is devoted to describing the conflict between the anarchist CNT and the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) and the resulting cancellation of the May Day demonstration and the build-up to the street fighting of the \"Barcelona May Days\". \"It was the antagonism between those who wished the revolution to go forward and those who wished to check or prevent it—ultimately, between Anarchists and Communists.\"\n\n\n=== Chapter nine (orig. ch. 10) ===\nOrwell relates his involvement in the \"May Days\"' Barcelona street fighting that began on 3 May when the Government Assault Guards tried to take the Telephone Exchange from the CNT workers who controlled it. For his part, Orwell acted as part of the POUM, guarding a POUM-controlled building. Although he realises that he is fighting on the side of the working class, Orwell describes his dismay at coming back to Barcelona on leave from the front only to get mixed up in street fighting. Assault Guards from Valencia arrive—\"All of them were armed with brand-new rifles ... vastly better than the dreadful old blunderbusses we had at the front.\" The Communist-controlled Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia newspapers declare POUM to be a disguised Fascist organisation—\"No one who was in Barcelona then, or for months later, will forget the horrible atmosphere produced by fear, suspicion, hatred, censored newspapers, crammed jails, enormous food queues, and prowling gangs of armed men.\" In his second appendix to the book, Orwell discusses the political issues at stake in the May 1937 Barcelona fighting, as he saw them at the time and later on, looking back.\n\n\n=== Chapter ten (orig. ch. 12) ===\nOrwell speculates on how the Spanish Civil War might turn out. Orwell predicts that the \"tendency of the post-war Government ... is bound to be Fascistic.\"\nHe returns to the front, where he is shot through the throat by a sniper, an injury that takes him out of the war. After spending some time in a hospital in Lleida, he was moved to Tarragona where his wound was finally examined more than a week after he'd left the front.\n\n\n=== Chapter eleven (orig. ch. 13) ===\nOrwell tells us of his various movements between hospitals in Siétamo, Barbastro, and Monzón while getting his discharge papers stamped, after being declared medically unfit. He returns to Barcelona only to find out from his wife that the POUM had been \"suppressed\": it had been declared illegal the very day he had left to obtain discharge papers and POUM members were being arrested without charge. \"The attack on Huesca was beginning ... there must have been numbers of men who were killed without ever learning that the newspapers in the rear were calling them Fascists. This kind of thing is a little difficult to forgive.\" While his wife went back to the hotel, he sleeps that night in the ruins of a church; he cannot go back to his hotel because of the danger of arrest.\n\n\n=== Chapter twelve (orig. ch. 14) ===\nThis chapter describes his visits accompanied by his wife to Georges Kopp, unit commander of the ILP Contingent while Kopp was held in a Spanish makeshift jail—\"really the ground floor of a shop.\" Having done all he could to free Kopp, ineffectively and at great personal risk, Orwell decides to leave Spain. Crossing the Pyrenees frontier, he and his wife arrived in France \"without incident\".\n\n\n=== Appendix one (orig. ch. 5) ===\nOrwell explains the divisions within the Republican side: \"On the one side the CNT-FAI, the POUM, and a section of the Socialists, standing for workers' control: on the other side the Right-wing Socialists, Liberals, and Communists, standing for centralized government and a militarized army.\" He also writes: \"One of the dreariest effects of this war has been to teach me that the Left-wing press is every bit as spurious and dishonest as that of the Right.\"\n\n\n=== Appendix two (orig. ch. 11) ===\nAn attempt to dispel some of the myths in the foreign press at the time (mostly the pro-Communist press) about the \"May Days\", the street fighting that took place in revolutionary Catalonia in early May 1937. This was between anarchists and POUM members, against Communist/government forces which sparked off when local police forces occupied the Telephone Exchange, which had until then been under the control of CNT workers. He relates the suppression of the POUM on 15–16 June 1937, gives examples of the Communist Press of the world—(Daily Worker, 21 June, \"Spanish Trotskyists Plot With Franco\"), indicates that Indalecio Prieto hinted, \"fairly broadly to the delegation that the government could not afford to offend the Communist Party while the Russians were supplying arms.\" He quotes Julián Zugazagoitia, the Minister of the Interior; \"We have received aid from Russia and have had to permit certain actions which we did not like.\"\n\n\n== Publication history ==\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nOrwell wrote diaries, made press-cuttings, and took photographs during his time in Spain, but they were all stolen before he left. In May 1937, he wrote the publisher of his previous books saying, \"I greatly hope I come out of this alive if only to write a book about it.\" According to his eventual publisher, \"Homage was begun in February [1937] in the trenches, written on scraps, the backs of envelopes, toilet paper. The written material was sent to Barcelona to McNair's office, where his wife Eileen Blair, working as a volunteer, typed it out section by section. Slowly it grew into a sizable parcel. McNair kept it in his own room.\"\nUpon escaping across the French border in June 1937, he stopped at the first post office available to telegram the National Statesman, asking if it would like a first-hand article. The offer was accepted but the article, \"Eyewitness in Barcelona\", was rejected by editor Kingsley Martin on grounds that his writing \"could cause trouble\" (it was picked up by Controversy). In the months after leaving Spain, Orwell wrote a number of essays on the war, notably \"Spilling the Spanish Beans\" and a praiseful review of Franz Borkenau's The Spanish Cockpit.\nWriting from his cottage at Wallington, Hertfordshire, he finished around New Year's Day 1938.\n\n\n=== First edition ===\nAfter Orwell had returned to England in 1937, his pitch for the memoir was quickly turned down by his own publisher Victor Gollancz, who worried that its publication might harm the cause of anti-fascism. Orwell concluded that Gollancz was \"part of the Communism-racket\" and sought out a different publisher; he was recommended by ILP secretary Fenner Brockway to Frederic Warburg, a publisher associated with the anti-Stalinist left, who agreed to a contract with Orwell. In September, a deal was signed for an advance of £150 (equivalent to £12,000 in 2023). By January 1938, Orwell had completed the book and, on 25 April 1938, Secker & Warburg published it under the title Homage to Catalonia. Orwell remarked to Jack Common that they had not been able to think of a better title.\nThe book was initially commercially unsuccessful, selling only 683 copies (out of 1,500) in its first 6 months, with many copies of its initial print run remaining unsold at the time of Orwell's death in 1950. Orwell himself had wondered if the book had been boycotted by the British press, while publisher Fredric Warburg himself believed that the book had been \"ignored and hectored into failure\". \"Ten years ago it was almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Communism; today it is almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Anarchism or 'Trotskyism',\" Orwell wrote bitterly in 1938.\n\n\n=== Later editions ===\nFollowing the success of Orwell's later books, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, it was posthumously recognised as a \"lost classic\" of the now-famous author. The book received a second wave of sales after the first American edition was published by Harcourt Brace, in 1952, with an introduction from literary critic Lionel Trilling. In Britain, Secker & Warburg published a new edition of the book in 1951; publication was taken over by Penguin Books in 1962 and it has never fallen out of print since then. The book received a third wave of sales during the late 1960s, buoyed by interest from the period's counterculture and the New Left. Historian Paul Preston speculated in 2017 that Homage had become the highest selling and most read book about the civil war.\nThese later editions incorporated revisions requested by Orwell himself, in order to correct some mistakes he had made in the first edition and to rearrange the chapter sequence so the \"general information\" about political context was moved to an appendices. In 1986, Peter Davison published an edition with a few footnotes based on Orwell's own footnotes found among his papers after he died.\n\n\n=== Translations ===\nThe only translation published in Orwell's lifetime was into Italian, in December 1948. A French translation by Yvonne Davet—with whom Orwell corresponded, commenting on her translation and providing explanatory notes—in 1938–39, was not published until 1955, five years after Orwell's death.\nOrwell's Homage finally received publication in Spain during the early 1970s, although much its content was suppressed and distorted by the Francoist censors. It received a second Spanish edition in 1978, after the approval of the Spanish Constitution, but it was not until 2007 that an uncensored, comprehensive edition of the book was published in Spain.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Contemporary reviews (1930s–1940s) ===\nInitial reception of Homage were mixed and few in number, with reviews being divided between supporters and opponents of Orwell's analysis of the conflict. \nMany positive reviews of the book came from Orwell's friends and political allies, such as Geoffrey Gorer and John McNair respectively. Veterans of World War I, such as Herbert Read and Gerald Brenan, praised the book for its vivid depiction of life on the frontlines of a war. Read commented that, except for a lack of artillery bombardment, Orwell's \"physical miseries\" in Aragon seemed worse than his own in Ypres; while Brenan related to his descriptions of war's \"immense boredom and its immense charm, the sense of being a human being again among other human beings.\" Irene Rathbone likewise wrote that he had captured the feelings of the men that fought in the World War, commenting that he was \"in essence\" a part of that same generation. Other positive reviews came from staunch anti-communists in Conservative and Catholic circles, who had opposed the Spanish Republic from the outset. A review for the conservative magazine The Spectator concluded that the \"dismal record of intrigue, injustice, incompetence, quarrelling, lying communist propaganda, police spying, illegal imprisonment, filth and disorder\" was evidence that the Spanish Republic had deserved to fall. The book also received a positive review from Austrian journalist Franz Borkenau, who wrote that Homage and his own book The Spanish Cockpit formed a complete picture of the Spanish Revolution of 1936.\nA mixed review for The Listener described the book as a \"muddle-headed and inaccurate\" account of the war and criticised it for its positive depiction of the POUM, while also praising Orwell's vivid description of \"the horror and filth, the futility and comedy, and even the beauty of war.\" Another mixed review was supplied by V. S. Pritchett who called Orwell naïve about Spain but added that \"no one excels him in bringing to the eyes, ears and nostrils the nasty ingredients of fevered situations; and I would recommend him warmly to all who are concerned about the realities of personal experience in a muddled cause\".\nIn a negative review for the Communist Party of Great Britain's newspaper, The Daily Worker, John Langdon-Davies wrote that \"the value of the book is that it gives an honest picture of the sort of mentality that toys with revolutionary romanticism but shies violently at revolutionary discipline. It should be read as a warning.\" Anti-fascist poet Nancy Cunard later wrote that the book was riddled with \"perfidious inaccuracies\" and came away from it thinking Orwell was a Trotskyist, wondering \"what kind of damage he has been doing, or trying to do, in Spain\". Other negative reviews were published in The Tablet and The Times Literary Supplement.\nBritish historian Tom Buchanan believed that, at the time of its initial publication, Orwell had \"delivered a message that was too unwelcome, and at too late a stage in the war, to stimulate the kind of debate that he may have wished to initiate.\" Most of the British left believed that the Spanish Civil War had been a simple conflict between democracy and fascism, ignoring the role of revolutionaries on the Republican side, which Orwell himself believed had made them complacent regarding the situation. In late 1937, when Nancy Cunard began soliciting opinions from British authors on which side of the conflict they supported, Orwell responded that he refused to write about \"defending democracy\", retorting that the Spanish Republican government had forced fascism onto Spanish workers \"under the pretext of resisting Fascism\". Kingsley Martin subsequently refused to publish any of Orwell's \"anti-government propaganda\" in the New Statesman, which led Orwell himself to conclude that he was a victim of censorship.\n\n\n=== Anti-communist reevaluation (1950s) ===\nThe success of Orwell's novels, and his death in 1950, brought Homage back into the limelight as people began to reassess the effect that his experiences in Spain had on his work. The release of several memoirs by Spanish ex-communists also triggered a reevaluation of the prescience of Orwell's criticisms of Communism, with Valentín González commenting that his writings had been \"confirmed\". In an obituary on Orwell, British literary critic V. S. Pritchett commented that \"Don Quixote saw the poker face of Communism\". In June 1950, the anti-communist writer Stephen Spender praised Homage as \"one of the most serious indictments of Communism which has been written\", remarking that the book demonstrated that all ideologies were capable of terrible things, if they are not taken together with \"a scrupulous regard for the sacredness of the truth of an individual life.\" He commented that: \"politically, the liquidation of the POUM was not an event of great importance; humanly speaking, it was a greater failure for the Republic even than the defeat.\" Spender even argued that Homage was a better book than Nineteen Eighty-Four, as it depicted \"real horrors and real betrayals\".\nUpon the publication of the book's first American edition in 1952, American literary critic Lionel Trilling exalted Orwell as a \"secular saint\", who was wholly committed to truth and journalistic objectivity. Historian John Rodden argued that Trilling's introduction to Homage was instrumental in bringing the book to prominence, as the American intelligentsia of the period had been in search of a \"moral and political condemnation\" of Spanish communism. American reviews re-conceived the book as a key piece of context for understanding Orwell's later work, presenting it as about \"the making of an anti-totalitarian\". Some understood it as a demonstration of communist tactics for seizing power, placing it within the post-WWII context of the formation of the Eastern Bloc and the People's Republic of China. American journalist Herbert Matthews was sharply critical of the book's re-contextualisation by Americans during the Cold War, arguing that its importance as an account of the Spanish Civil War had been eclipsed by its status as an anti-communist exposé.\n\n\n=== Socialist reevaluation and communist backlash (1960s–1970s) ===\nAnother reevaluation of Homage came during the 1960s, as the emerging counterculture and the New Left brought a new generation of readers to pick up the book. The anti-communist tendencies of the 1950s, which had buried Orwell's positive depiction of revolutionary socialism, were partly reversed and Orwell was again reconceived as a predecessor of Che Guevara. In 1971, the Welsh socialist scholar Raymond Williams commented that Homage had been reevaluated, in the context of the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Protests of 1968, as taking a position in favour of revolutionary socialism and opposed to both capitalism and Marxism-Leninism. This position was exemplified in Noam Chomsky's book American Power and the New Mandarins, in which the author used Homage to directly compare the Spanish revolution with Vietnamese resistance to US intervention, arguing that neither complied with the \"liberal dogma\" of the American intelligentsia. He speculated that the book's status as a symbol of 1950s anti-communism would have been \"of little comfort to the author\". Raymond Carr praised Orwell in 1971 for being \"determined to set down the truth as he saw it.\" In his 1971 memoir, Herbert Matthews of The New York Times declared, \"The book did more to blacken the Loyalist cause than any work written by enemies of the Second Republic.\" \nThe revival in the book's popularity also triggered indignation from figures in the CPGB, which had never forgiven Orwell for it. In 1967, the historian Frank Jellinek expressed regret that the book had been exploited by anti-communists such as James Burnham and that it had brought the suppression of the POUM, which he called a \"fairly minor piece of wartime expediency\", to a prominent place within historiography of the civil war. In the late 1970s, British communist veterans of the war, such as Thomas Murray and Frank Graham, denounced the book respectively as a \"weapon\" of the anti-Stalinist left and as a slander against the International Brigades. In 1984, CPGB politician and former commander of the International Brigades, Bill Alexander, accused Orwell of lacking anti-fascist sentiments and called the book an \"establishment\" denigration of the \"real issues\" of anti-fascism. That same year, Lawrence and Wishart published Inside the Myth, a collection of essays from authors hostile to Orwell, which John Newsinger described as \"an obvious attempt to do as much damage to his reputation as possible\". To Tom Buchanan, the sustained Communist campaign against Homage had been \"so wrongheaded and ill-informed that it has probably, if anything, bolstered Orwell's reputation.\" He concluded that the legacy of the book, which cemented the repression of the POUM in popular historiography and damaged the reputation of the Communist Party, revealed the potential that single books can have to leave their mark on history.\nNevertheless, the revolutionary conception of Homage continued through the subsequent decades, with British film-maker Ken Loach notably adapting the book into his 1995 film Land and Freedom. Tom Buchanan comments that the film may not have been received as well if previous generations had not been primed to view the Spanish Civil War through the lens of \"the Revolution betrayed\". Buchanan was critical of the far-left's adoption of the book, pointing out that Orwell had never fully agreed with the POUM's politics and that his view of revolutionary Spain \"ignit[ing] the passions of workers around the world\" had been naïve, given the prevalence of dictatorship at the time. He also commented that Orwell's revolutionary politics had been \"unconvincing\" and only a brief phase of his political development, which evolved and changed following his publication of Homage, as evidenced by his more moderate reflection in his 1942 essay \"Looking Back on the Spanish War\".\n\n\n=== Historiographical evaluation (1970s–present) ===\nWhen histories of the civil war first started to be published, historians generally disregarded Homage as a primary source. In his 1962 book The Spanish Civil War, English historian Hugh Thomas wrote that, while he thought Homage was a well-written memoir that was \"perceptive about war\", he also considered it to be misleading about the events of the war. He thought that Orwell had misjudged the war by believing that revolutionary idealism alone was capable of achieving victory; Thomas himself believed that the only way that the Republic could have won the war was through a process of centralisation and militarisation, backed by the Soviet Union. Tom Buchanan himself disputed Thomas' assessment that Homage was \"misleading\" on the war, so long as it was not considered a description of the conflict as a whole. Paul Preston likewise cautioned against taking the book as an \"overview of the civil war, which it is not\". In contrast, Homage has also contributed to a historiographical trend that centred the internal conflict within the Republican faction, exemplified by the work of Burnett Bolloten.\nA revival of interest in the Spanish Civil War was later ignited by the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, as a new generation of historians began studying the conflict and Orwell's own account of it, which received increasing amounts of scrutiny over his interpretation of the events. Gabriel Jackson wrote that Orwell had understood the civil war only as an analogue to the situation in Europe and lacked an understanding of the local political context in Spain. Michael Seidman argued that Orwell's depiction of the \"working-class paradise\" in Barcelona was questionable, as he had only been accounting for the convinced militants and not the \"indifference\" of many individual workers. Helen Graham pointed out how the internecine conflicts witnessed by Orwell had predated the civil war and Soviet intervention in the conflict, arguing against the \"Cold War parable of an alien Stalinism which 'injected' conflict into Spanish Republican politics\", although her analysis of the consequences of the May Days ultimately aligned with Orwell's. \nIn his own analysis of the book's effect on historiography, Tom Buchanan found that research on the conflict had not entirely disqualified Homage, but had instead emphasised it as a \"snapshot of a complex political situation\" taken by an outsider. Although Orwell himself warned readers to be aware of his own biases, mistakes and distortions, even engaging in self-deprecation over his own lack of knowledge of Spanish history and culture, Buchanan worried that people whose only insight into the conflict was Orwell's book would \"receive a very unbalanced picture of the conflict as a whole.\" Buchanan concluded that the \"very real danger\" presented by the book was that it had been recontextualised, from an individual's personal account, into a book that was seen as representative of the civil war as a whole.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nWithin weeks of leaving Spain, a deposition (discovered in 1989) was presented to the Tribunal for Espionage & High Treason, Valencia, charging the Orwells with 'rabid Trotskyism' and being agents of the POUM. The trial of the leaders of the POUM and of Orwell (in his absence) took place in Barcelona, in October and November 1938. Observing events from French Morocco, Orwell wrote that they were \"only a by-product of the Russian Trotskyist trials and from the start every kind of lie, including flagrant absurdities, has been circulated in the Communist press.\"\nGeorges Kopp, deemed \"quite likely\" shot in the book's final chapter, was released in December 1938.\nBarcelona fell to Franco's forces on 26 January 1939, and on 1 April 1939, the last of the Republican forces surrendered.\n\n\n=== Effect on Orwell ===\n\n\n==== Health ====\nOrwell never knew the source of his tuberculosis, from complications of which he died in 1950. However, in 2018, researchers studying bacteria on his letters announced that there was a \"very high probability\" that Orwell contracted the disease in a Spanish hospital.\n\n\n==== Politics ====\nOrwell reflected that he \"had felt what socialism could be like\" and, according to biographer Gordon Bowker, \"Orwell never did abandon his socialism: if anything, his Spanish experience strengthened it.\" In a letter to Cyril Connolly, written on 8 June 1937, Orwell said, \"At last [I] really believe in Socialism, which I never did before\". A decade later he wrote: \"Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism, as I understand it.\"\nOrwell's experiences, culminating in his and his wife Eileen O'Shaughnessy's narrow escape from the communist purges in Barcelona in June 1937, greatly increased his sympathy for the POUM and, while not affecting his moral and political commitment to socialism, made him a lifelong anti-Stalinist.\nAfter reviewing Koestler's bestselling Darkness at Noon, Orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism. He soon wrote Animal Farm, \"his scintillating 1944 satire on Stalinism\".\n\n\n=== Works inspired by the book ===\nOrwell himself went on to write a poem about the Italian militiaman he described in the book's opening pages. The poem was included in Orwell's 1942 essay \"Looking Back on the Spanish War\", published in New Road in 1943. The closing phrase of the poem, \"No bomb that ever burst shatters the crystal spirit\", was later taken by George Woodcock for the title of his Governor General's Award-winning critical study of Orwell and his work, The Crystal Spirit (1966).\nIn 1995 Ken Loach released the film Land and Freedom, heavily inspired by Homage to Catalonia.\nHomage to Catalonia influenced Rebecca Solnit's second book, Savage Dreams.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnarchist Catalonia\nBibliography of George Orwell\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls\nThe Spanish Cockpit\nILP Contingent described in Homage to Catalonia\nLes grands cimetières sous la lune\nSpanish Revolution\nWilliam Herrick 'an American Orwell', also disillusioned by Stalinism in Spain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBowker, Gordon (2004) [2003]. \"The Road to Morocco\".

Its first half documents his sociological investigations of the bleak living conditions among the working class in Lancashire and Yorkshire in the industrial north of England before World War II. Its second half is a long essay on his middle-class upbringing, and the development of his political conscience, questioning British attitudes towards socialism. Orwell states plainly that he himself is in favour of socialism, but feels it necessary to point out reasons why many people who would benefit from socialism, and should logically support it, are in practice likely to be strong opponents.\nAccording to Orwell biographer Bernard Crick, publisher Victor Gollancz first tried to persuade Orwell's agent to allow the Left Book Club edition to consist solely of the descriptive first half of the book. When this was refused Gollancz wrote an introduction to the book. \"Victor could not bear to reject it, even though his suggestion that the 'repugnant' second half should be omitted from the Club edition was turned down. On this occasion Victor, albeit nervously, did overrule Communist Party objections in favour of his publishing instinct. His compromise was to publish the book with [an introduction] full of good criticism, unfair criticism, and half-truths.\"\nThe book grapples \"with the social and historical reality of Depression suffering in the north of England, – Orwell does not wish merely to enumerate evils and injustices, but to break through what he regards as middle-class oblivion, – Orwell's corrective to such falsity comes first by immersion of his own body – a supreme measure of truth for Orwell – directly into the experience of misery.\"\n\n",

His compromise was to publish the book with [an introduction] full of good criticism, unfair criticism, and half-truths.\"\nThe book grapples \"with the social and historical reality of Depression suffering in the north of England, – Orwell does not wish merely to enumerate evils and injustices, but to break through what he regards as middle-class oblivion, – Orwell's corrective to such falsity comes first by immersion of his own body – a supreme measure of truth for Orwell – directly into the experience of misery.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nOrwell submitted the typescript of Keep the Aspidistra Flying to Gollancz on 15 January 1936. At some point in the next few days Gollancz asked him to consider a new project – writing a book about unemployment and social conditions in economically depressed northern England. In the period from 31 January to 30 March 1936, Orwell lived in Wigan, Barnsley and Sheffield researching the book.\nGollancz was not only a successful publisher but also a dedicated social reformer. \"As a social reformer, a socialist, and an idealist, Gollancz had an unquestioning, perhaps overly optimistic, faith in education; if only people could be made to know the nature of poverty, he thought, they would want to eradicate it, remove from power the government that tolerated it, and transform the economic system that brought it into being.\" As a successful publisher however, he knew that to reach a large audience he needed something more than a collection of facts, statistics, graphs and dogmatic conclusions.\nThe view that this was a specific commission with a £500 advance – two years' income for Orwell at the time – is based on a recollection by Geoffrey Gorer who was interviewed for Melvyn Bragg's TV programme Omnibus in 1970. He reported that Gollancz had offered Orwell £500 to underwrite the trip, and but for Gollancz's support Orwell would never have gone. Recent biographers, however, do not repeat this account. On 1 April 1936, Orwell rented a cottage in the remote village of Wallington, Hertfordshire, where he wrote The Road to Wigan Pier. Biographer Michael Shelden points out that the rental for the cottage was less than £2 a month.\nOrwell, as well as living off the land, supplemented his income by running the cottage as the village store. Yet, writing to Jack Common in April 1936 about setting up shop, \"Orwell sounds hard put to find £20 in order to stock his shelves, rather than a man who had received £500 a couple of months earlier.\" When it came to marrying, Orwell wrote to Gorer: \"I should never be economically justified in marrying, so might as well be unjustified now as later\". D. J. Taylor argues that these factors, and the fact that Gollancz was not a person to part with such a sum on speculation, suggest that Gorer was confusing Orwell's eventual earnings from the book with a small contribution for out-of-pocket expenses that Gollancz might have given him.\nOrwell set out on the journey on the last day of January 1936, having given up his job at \"Booklovers' Corner\" and his flat in Kentish Town; he would not live in London again until 1940. He made no plans, but Richard Rees promised to send him names of people in the north connected with The Adelphi or the Adelphi Summer School who might help him – Orwell also established a network of contacts through the National Unemployed Workers' Movement. One of these NUWM contacts was Jack Hilton, a working-class author from Rochdale. Orwell wrote to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for advice on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging, but suggested that he travel to Wigan rather than Rochdale, \"for there are the colliers and they’re good stuff.\" For the next two months Orwell followed a route from Birmingham to Manchester to Leeds. He kept a diary from 31 January to 25 March, which records the unretouched material that he would develop into the first part of The Road to Wigan Pier.\nFor three weeks in February 1936 he was in Wigan, the longest single stop he would make; March was allotted to Yorkshire – Sheffield, Leeds, Barnsley. He had completed a rough first draft of the book by October and sent off the final version to Moore in December.\nGollancz published the work under the Left Book Club, which gave Orwell a far higher circulation than his previous works. However, Gollancz feared the second half would offend Left Book Club readers and inserted a mollifying preface to the book while Orwell was in Spain. The original edition included 32 illustrations that were photographs of Welsh coal miners and of slums in the East End of London. Orwell did not choose the images and their inclusion may not have been his idea.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe book is divided into two sections.\n\nPart One\nGeorge Orwell set out to report on working-class life in the bleak industrial heartlands of the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire. He spent his time living among the people and as such his descriptions are detailed and vivid.\n\nChapter One describes the life of the Brooker family, a more wealthy example of the northern working class. They have a shop and cheap lodging house in their home. Orwell describes the old people who live in the home and their living conditions.\nChapter Two describes the life of miners and conditions down a coal mine. Orwell describes how he went down a coal mine to observe proceedings and he explains how the coal is distributed. The working conditions are very poor. This is the part of the book most often quoted.\nChapter Three describes the social situation of the average miner. Hygienic and financial conditions are discussed. Orwell explains why most miners do not actually earn as much as they are sometimes believed to.\nChapter Four describes the housing situation in the industrial north. There is a housing shortage in the region and therefore people are more likely to accept substandard housing. The housing conditions are very poor.\nChapter Five explores unemployment and Orwell explains that the unemployment statistics of the time are misleading.\nChapter Six deals with the food of the average miner and how, although they generally have enough money to buy food, most families prefer to buy something tasty to enrich their dull lives. This leads to malnutrition and physical degeneration in many families.\nChapter Seven describes the ugliness of the industrial towns in the north of England.\nPart Two\nIn contrast to the straightforward documentary of the first part of the book, in part two Orwell discusses the relevance of socialism to improving living conditions. This section proved controversial.\nOrwell sets out his initial premises very simply:\n\nAre the appalling conditions described in part one tolerable? (No)\nIs socialism \"wholeheartedly applied as a world system\" capable of improving those conditions? (Yes)\nWhy then are we not all socialists?\nThe rest of the book consists of Orwell's attempt to answer this difficult question. He points out that most people who argue against socialism do not do so because of straightforward selfish motives, or because they do not believe that the system would work, but for more complex emotional reasons, which (according to Orwell) most socialists misunderstand. He identifies five main problems:\n\nClass prejudice. This is real and it is visceral. Middle-class socialists do themselves no favours by pretending it does not exist and – by glorifying the manual worker – they tend to alienate the large section of the population that is economically working-class but culturally middle-class.\nMachine worship. Orwell finds most socialists guilty of this. Orwell himself is suspicious of technological progress for its own sake and thinks it inevitably leads to softness and decadence. He points out that most fictional technically advanced socialist utopias are deadly dull. H. G. Wells in particular is criticised on these grounds.\nCrankiness. Among many other types of people Orwell specifies people who have beards or wear sandals, vegetarians, and nudists as contributing to socialism's negative reputation among many more conventional people.\nTurgid language. Those who pepper their sentences with \"notwithstandings\" and \"heretofores\" and become over excited when discussing dialectical materialism are unlikely to gain much popular support.\nFailure to concentrate on the basics. Socialism should be about common decency and fair shares for all rather than political orthodoxy or philosophical consistency.\nIn presenting these arguments Orwell takes on the role of devil's advocate. He states very plainly that he himself is in favour of socialism but feels it necessary to point out reasons why many people, who would benefit from socialism, and should logically support it, are in practice likely to be strong opponents.\nOrwell's publisher, Victor Gollancz, was so concerned that these passages would be misinterpreted, and that the (mostly middle-class) members of the Left Book Club would be offended, that he added a foreword in which he raises some caveats about Orwell's claims in Part Two. He suggests, for instance, that Orwell may exaggerate the visceral contempt that the English middle classes hold for the working class, adding, however, that, \"I may be a bad judge of the question, for I am a Jew, and passed the years of my early boyhood in a fairly close Jewish community; and, among Jews of this type, class distinctions do not exist.\"\nOther concerns Gollancz raises are that Orwell should so instinctively dismiss movements such as pacifism or feminism as incompatible with or counter-productive to the Socialist cause, and that Orwell relies too much upon a poorly defined, emotional concept of Socialism. Gollancz claims that Orwell \"does not once define what he means by Socialism\" in The Road to Wigan Pier. The foreword does not appear in some modern editions of the book, though it was included, for instance, in Harcourt Brace Jovanovich's first American edition in the 1950s.\nAt a later date Gollancz published part one on its own, against Orwell's wishes, and he refused to publish Homage to Catalonia at all.\n\n\n== Book title ==\nOrwell was asked about Wigan Pier in a radio programme in December 1943. He replied: \"Well, I am afraid I must tell you that Wigan Pier doesn't exist. I made a journey specially to see it in 1936 and I couldn't find it. It did exist once, however, and to judge from the photographs it must have been about twenty feet [six metres] long.\" The original \"pier\" at Wigan was a coal loading staithe, probably a wooden jetty, where wagons of coal from a nearby colliery were unloaded into waiting barges on the canal. The original wooden pier is believed to have been demolished in 1929, with the iron from the tippler being sold as scrap.\nAlthough a pier is a structure built out into the water from the shore, in Britain the term has the connotation of a seaside holiday. In the broadcast radio interview of 1943 Orwell elaborated on the name Wigan Pier: \"Wigan is in the middle of the mining areas. The landscape is mostly slag-heaps – Wigan has always been picked on as a symbol of the ugliness of the industrial areas. At one time, on one of the muddy little canals that run round the town, there used to be a tumble-down wooden jetty; and by way of a joke some nicknamed this Wigan Pier. The joke caught on locally, and then the music-hall comedians got hold of it, and they are the ones who have succeeded in keeping Wigan Pier alive as a byword.\"\nGeographically, Wigan Pier is the name given today to the area around the canal at the bottom of the Wigan flight of locks on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.\n\n\n== Reviews and criticism ==\nThe book was reviewed on 14 March 1937 by Edward Shanks, for The Sunday Times, and by Hugh Massingham, for The Observer.\n\n\n=== Initial response ===\nIn general, early reviewers of The Road to Wigan Pier praised Orwell's depiction of the working class in Part I. The poet Edith Sitwell wrote: \"The horror of the beginning ... is unsurpassable. He seems to be doing for the modern world what Engels did for the world of 1840–50. But with this difference, that Orwell is a born writer, whereas Engels, fiery and splendid spirit though he was, simply wasn't a writer.\" Responses to Part II, as the book transformed from reportage into a mix of politics, polemics, and selective autobiography, were more varied, ranging from praise to anger and indignation. Arthur Calder-Marshall's 20 March 1937 review in Time and Tide celebrates Orwell's achievement, and can be summarised by its first line: \"Of Mr Orwell's book, there is little to say except praise.\"\nThis sentiment is shared in a review by Hamish Miles in New Statesman and Nation on 1 May 1937. Miles writes that The Road to Wigan Pier \"is a living and lively book from start to finish. The honest Tory must face what he tells and implies, and the honest Socialist must face him, too.\" Douglas Goldring, writing in Fortnightly in April 1937, describes the book as \"beautiful\" and \"disturbing\", and like Miles highly recommends that both conservatives and socialists read it. In Tribune on 12 March 1937, Walter Greenwood calls Part I \"authentic and first rate\" but was more ambivalent towards Part II: \"[In Part II, Orwell] has you with him one moment and provoked beyond endurance the next ... I cannot remember having been so infuriated for a long time than by some of the things he says here.\"\nH. J. Laski, a co-founder of the Left Book Club, wrote a review in March 1937 in Left News which repeats the main arguments of Gollancz's preface. Laski claims that Part I is \"admirable propaganda for our ideas\" but that Part II falls short: \"But having, very ably, depicted a disease, Mr Orwell does what so many well-meaning people do: needing a remedy (he knows it is socialism), he offers an incantation instead. He thinks that an appeal to 'liberty' and 'justice' will, on the basis of facts such as he has described, bring people tumbling over one another into the Socialist Party. ... This view is based on fallacies so elementary that I should doubt the necessity of explaining them as fallacies were it not that there are so many people who share Mr Orwell's view. Its basic error is the belief that we all mean the same things by liberty and justice. Most emphatically we do not.\"\nIn the April 1937 edition of the Left News, Gollancz reported that the book had produced \"both more, and more interesting, letters than any other Club Choice. The book has done, perhaps in a greater degree than any previous book, what the Club is meant to do – it has provoked thought, and discussion of the keenest kind. While members with a training in scientific socialism have been surprised at the naïveté of the second part, they have found it valuable, as showing how much education they still have to do.\" Orwell biographers Stansky and Abrahams noted: \"But Gollancz and Laski, believing in a scientific rather than an emotional socialism, believing (in 1937) that it was still possible to equip people to fight against war and Fascism, were caught in a time warp: history was leaving them behind. Orwell in Spain was continuing his education – in a real war against Fascism – and it was very different from anything envisioned by the selectors of the Left Book Club. What he was learning had less to do with scientific socialism than with the morality of politics, and it would change his life.\"\nA radio play by David Pownall, Writing on Wigan Pier, with Adrian Scarborough as Orwell, was broadcast by BBC Radio Four in 2010.\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\nCommunist Party of Great Britain leader Harry Pollitt, who was also an acquaintance of Orwell and a native of Lancashire where the book is set, gave a strongly negative review. Although Pollitt praised Orwell's description of mining conditions and the indictment of housing in industrial centres, he believed that Road to Wigan Pier was a snobbish portrayal of working class life. \n\nIf ever snobbery had its hallmark placed upon it, it is by Mr Orwell. If on his return from Mandalay he had bought one or two penny pamphlets on socialism and the working-class movement, what fatal experiences he could have saved himself from, Because one never gets to know the movement by slumming.\nI gather that the chief thing that worries Mr Orwell is the \"smell\" of the working-class, for smells seem to occupy the major portion of the book. Well, pardon me if I say at once, without any working-class snobbery, that it's a lie.\nPollitt also attacked Orwell for judging people on their aesthetic, rather than whether they wanted to build a better world. \n\nI am not concerned whether a man wants to drink a lemonade with a straw and in shorts or whether coming out of the docks he calls for a pint of Mann and Crossman's: the thing I am concerned about is: are they concerned to try and build up a new society? If so, what is the best way in which we can help them? And we don't do this by telling them they \"smell\", or that they are \"showing fat bottoms in shorts\". It can only be done by patient argument, by careful explanation, and by really trying to understand their particular problems, and show by our understanding that we want to help.\nAccording to Christopher Hitchens, the allegation of having said \"the working classes smell\" in The Road to Wigan Pier became a recurring criticism of Orwell from critics on the Left, despite it not being his personal sentiment. \"As his published correspondence shows, every time Orwell wrote anything objectionable to the Left, up would come this old charge again, having attained the mythic status that placed it beyond mere factual refutation.\" In the book, according to Hitchens, Orwell instead refers to it being \"middle-class people, such as his own immediate forebears, [that] were convinced that 'the working classes smell'.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nCoal miners\nWigan Pier\nSnob\n\n\n== References ==\nGeorge Orwell, a Life by Bernard Crick – Penguin 1980\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Road to Wigan Pier at Faded Page (Canada)\nThe Road to Wigan Pier – Searchable, indexed etext.\nOrwell answers a question about Wigan Pier at the Wayback Machine (archived 17 July 2009) (Excerpt from a broadcast of the BBC's Overseas Service)\nDavid Sharrock, \"The road to Wigan Pier, 75 years on\", The Observer, 20 February 2011.\nGeorge Orwell Wigan in pictures from The Guardian",

However, Tocqueville criticizes the moral, spiritual, artistic, and interpersonal costs of a society where social mobility and restlessness are organizing expectations.  Ultimately, since its publication, the work has had a dramatic impact on American (as well as broader Western) thought and education; especially in history, political science, and the social sciences.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nTocqueville begins his book by describing the change in social conditions taking place. He observed that over the previous seven hundred years the social and economic conditions of men had become more equal.  The aristocracy, Tocqueville believed, was gradually disappearing as the modern world experienced the beneficial effects of equality.  Tocqueville traced the development of equality to a number of factors, such as granting all men permission to enter the clergy, widespread economic opportunity resulting from the growth of trade and commerce, the royal sale of titles of nobility as a monarchical fundraising tool, and the abolition of primogeniture.\nTocqueville described this revolution as a \"providential fact\" of an \"irresistible revolution,\" leading some to criticize the determinism found in the book.  However, based on Tocqueville's correspondences with friends and colleagues, Marvin Zetterbaum, Professor Emeritus at University of California Davis, concludes that the Frenchman never accepted democracy as determined or inevitable.  He did, however, consider equality more just and therefore found himself among its partisans. Given the social state that was emerging, Tocqueville believed that a \"new political science\" would be needed, in order to:\n\n[I]nstruct democracy, if possible to reanimate its beliefs, to purify its motives, to regulate its movements, to substitute little by little the science of affairs for its inexperience, and knowledge of its true instincts for its blind instincts; to adapt its government to time and place; to modify it according to circumstances and men: such is the first duty imposed on those who direct society in our day.\nThe remainder of the book can be interpreted as an attempt to accomplish this goal, thereby giving advice to those people who would experience this change in social states. Tocqueville's message is somewhat beyond the American democracy itself, which was rather an illustration to his philosophical claim that democracy is an effect of industrialization. This explains why Tocqueville does not unambiguously define democracy and even ignores the intents of the Founding Fathers of the United States regarding the American political system: To pursue the central idea of his study—a democratic revolution caused by industrialization, as exemplified by America—Tocqueville persistently refers to democracy. This is in fact very different from what the Founding Fathers of the United States meant. Moreover, Tocqueville himself is not quite consistent in using the word 'democracy', applying it alternately to representative government, universal suffrage or majority-based governance:\n The American institutions are democratic, not only in their principle but in all their consequences; and the people elects its representatives directly, and for the most part annually, in order to ensure their dependence. The people is therefore the real directing power; and although the form of government is representative, it is evident that the opinions, the prejudices, the interests, and even the passions of the community are hindered by no durable obstacles from exercising a perpetual influence on society. In the United States the majority governs in the name of the people, as is the case in all the countries in which the people is supreme.\nDemocracy in America, Book 2, Ch I, 1st and 2nd paragraph\nSuch an ambiguous understanding of democracy in a study of great impact on political thought could not help leaving traces. We suppose that it was Tocqueville's work and not least its title that strongly associated the notion of democracy with the American system and, ultimately, with representative government and universal suffrage. The recent 'Tocqueville renaissance', which enforces the democratic image of the United States and, correspondingly, of other Western countries, also speaks for the role of Tocqueville's work.\n\n\n== Main themes ==\n\n\n=== Puritan founding ===\nTocqueville begins his study of the U.S. by explaining the contribution of the Puritans.  According to him, the Puritans established the U.S. democratic social state of equality. They arrived equals in education and were all middle class.  In addition, Tocqueville observes that they contributed a synthesis of religion and political liberty in America that was uncommon in Europe, particularly in France. He calls the Puritan Founding the \"seed\" of his entire work.\n\n\n=== Federal constitution ===\nTocqueville believed that the Puritans established the principle of sovereignty of the people in the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. The American Revolution then popularized this principle, followed by the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which developed institutions to manage popular will. While Tocqueville speaks highly of the U.S. Constitution, he believes that the mores, or \"habits of mind\" of the American people play a more prominent role in the protection of freedom. These include:\n\nTownship democracy\nMores, laws, and circumstances\nTyranny of the majority\nReligion and beliefs\nThe family\nIndividualism\nAssociations\nSelf-interest rightly understood\nMaterialism\n\n\n=== Situation of women ===\nTocqueville was one of the first social critics to examine the situation of U.S. women and to identify the concept of separate spheres. The section Influence of Democracy on Manners Properly So Called of the second volume is devoted to his observations of women's status in U.S. society. He writes: \"In no country has such constant care been taken as in America to trace two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes and to make them keep pace one with the other, but in two pathways that are always different.\"\nHe argues that the collapse of aristocracy lessened the patriarchal rule in the family where fathers would control daughters' marriages, meaning that women had the option of remaining unmarried and retaining a higher degree of independence. Married women, by contrast, lost all independence \"in the bonds of matrimony\" as \"in America paternal discipline [by the woman's father] is very relaxed and the conjugal tie very strict.\" Yet despite this lack of independence, he believed America would \"raise woman and make her more and more the equal of man\" and praised America for having more legal protections for women than in France. Tocqueville believed women would be contributors to America's prosperity and strength despite the limitations of the time, stating:\n\nAs for myself, I do not hesitate to avow that although the women of the United States are confined within the narrow circle of domestic life, and their situation is in some respects one of extreme dependence, I have nowhere seen women occupying a loftier position; and if I were asked, ... to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of that people ought mainly to be attributed, I should reply,—to the superiority of their women.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe primary focus of Democracy in America is an analysis of why republican representative democracy has succeeded in the United States while failing in so many other places. Tocqueville seeks to apply the functional aspects of democracy in the United States to what he sees as the failings of democracy in his native France.\nTocqueville speculates on the future of democracy in the United States, discussing possible threats to democracy and possible dangers of democracy.  These include his belief that democracy has a tendency to degenerate into \"soft despotism\" as well as the risk of developing a tyranny of the majority.  He observes that the strong role religion played in the United States was due to its separation from the government, a separation all parties found agreeable. He contrasts this to France, where there was what he perceived to be an unhealthy antagonism between democrats and the religious, which he relates to the connection between church and state.\nInsightful analysis of political society was supplemented in the second volume by description of civil society as a sphere of private and civilian affairs, mirroring Hegel. Tocqueville observed that social mechanisms have paradoxes, as in what later became known as the Tocqueville effect: \"social frustration increases as social conditions improve\". He wrote that this growing hatred of social privilege, as social conditions improve, leads to the state concentrating more power to itself. Tocqueville's views on the United States took a darker turn after 1840, however, as made evident in Craiutu and Jennings' Tocqueville on America after 1840: Letters and Other Writings.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nDemocracy in America was published in two volumes, the first in 1835 and the other in 1840. It was immediately popular in both Europe and the United States, while also having a profound impact on the French population. By the twentieth century, it had become a classic work of political science, social science, and history. It is a commonly assigned reading for undergraduates of American universities majoring in the political or social sciences, and part of the introductory political theory syllabus at Cambridge, Oxford, Princeton and other institutions.  In the introduction to his translation of the book, Harvard Professor Harvey C. Mansfield calls it \"at once the best book ever written on democracy and the best book ever written on America.\"\nTocqueville's work is often acclaimed for making a number of astute predictions. He anticipates the potential acrimony over the abolition of slavery that would tear apart the United States and lead to the American Civil War, as well as the eventual superpower rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which exploded after World War II and spawned the Cold War.\nNoting the rise of the industrial sector in the American economy, Tocqueville argued  that an industrial aristocracy would rise from the ownership of labor. He warned that 'friends of democracy must keep an anxious eye peeled in this direction at all times', observing that the route of industry was the gate by which a newfound wealthy class might potentially dominate, although he himself believed that an industrial aristocracy would differ from the formal aristocracy of the past.\nIn spending several chapters lamenting the state of the arts in America, he fails to envision the literary renaissance that would shortly arrive in the form of such major writers as Edgar Allan Poe, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Walt Whitman. Equally, in dismissing the country's interest in science as limited to pedestrian applications for streamlining the production of material goods, he failed to imagine America's burgeoning appetite for pure scientific research and discovery.\nAccording to Tocqueville, democracy had some unfavorable consequences: the tyranny of the majority over thought, a preoccupation with material goods, and isolated individuals. Democracy in America was interpreted differently across national contexts. In France and the United States, Tocqueville's work was seen as liberal, whereas both progressives and conservatives in the British Isles interpreted his work as supporting their own positions.\nTocqueville's book can be compared with Letters on the English (1733) by Voltaire in how it flatteringly explains a nation to itself from the perspective of an outsider. Voltaire based his book on his experiences living in Great Britain as his compatriot Tocqueville did a century later in America, and according to the National Constitution Center, \"Voltaire's passages on the spirit of commerce, religious diversity, religious freedom, and the English form of government also greatly influenced American thinking\".\n\n\n== Translations ==\nHenry Reeve, translated 1835.

    "full_narrative": "The Origins of Totalitarianism, published in 1951, was Hannah Arendt's first major work, where she describes and analyzes Nazism and Stalinism as the major totalitarian political movements of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Origins of Totalitarianism was first published in English in 1951. A German translation was published in 1955 as Elemente und Ursprünge totaler Herrschaft (\"Elements and Origins of Totalitarian Rule\"). A second, enlarged edition was published in 1958, which contained an updated Preface and two additional chapters, replacing her original \"Concluding Remarks\". Chapter Thirteen was titled \"Ideology and Terror: A novel form of government\", which she had published separately in 1953. Chapter Fourteen dealt with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, entitled \"Epilogue: Reflections on the Hungarian Revolution\". Subsequent editions omitted this chapter, which was published separately in English (\"Totalitarian Imperialism: Reflections on the Hungarian Revolution\") and German (Die ungarische Revolution und der totalitäre Imperialismus) in 1958. In 1967, Arendt wrote Prefaces for each of the book's three Parts, which appeared in subsequent editions.\n\n\n== Structure and content ==\nLike many of Arendt's books, The Origins of Totalitarianism is structured as three essays: \"Antisemitism\", \"Imperialism\" and \"Totalitarianism\". The book describes the various preconditions and subsequent rise of anti-Semitism in central, eastern, and western Europe in the early-to-mid 19th century; then examines the New Imperialism, from 1884 to the start of the First World War (1914–18); then traces the emergence of racism as an ideology, and its modern application as an “ideological weapon for imperialism”, by the Boers during the Great Trek in the early 19th century  (1830s–40s).\nIn this book, Arendt argues that totalitarianism was a \"novel form of government,\" that \"differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship\" in that it applied terror to subjugate mass populations rather than just political adversaries. Further, Arendt states that, owing to its peculiar ideology and the role assigned to it in its apparatus of coercion, \"totalitarianism has discovered a means of dominating and terrorizing human beings from within\"  She further contends that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy. That totalitarianism in Germany was, in the end, about terror and consistency, not eradicating Jews only. A key concept arising from this book was the application of Kant's phrase \"Radical Evil\", which she applied to the men who created and carried out such tyranny and their depiction of their victims as \"Superfluous People\".\n\n\n=== Analysis of antisemitism and imperialism ===\nArendt begins the book with an analysis of the rise of antisemitism in Europe and particularly focused on the Dreyfus affair. In particular, Arendt traces the social movement of the Jewry in Europe since their emancipation by the French edict of 1792, their special role in supporting and maintaining the nation-state and their failure to assimilate into the European class society. European Jewry's association with the nation-state meant that their destinies were to an extent tied. As Arendt observed, \"modern anti-semitism grew in proportion as traditional nationalism declined, and reached its climax at the exact moment when the European system of nation-states and its precarious balance of power crashed.\" Nazi Germany would later exploit that antisemitism and targeted the Jewry, which was construed, among other things, as a proxy for the nation-state. In so doing, Nazism sought, among other reasons, to organize the masses to bring about the disintegration of the nation-state system and to advance the totalitarian project, which was global in its orientation.\nShe then discusses scientific racism and its role in colonialist imperialism, which was itself characterized by unlimited territorial and economic expansion. That unlimited expansion necessarily opposed itself and was hostile to the territorially-delimited nation-state. Arendt traces the roots of modern imperialism to the accumulation of excess capital in European nation-states during the 19th century.  This capital required overseas investments outside of Europe to be productive and political control had to be expanded overseas to protect the investments.  She then examines \"continental imperialism\" (pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism) and the emergence of \"movements\" substituting themselves to the political parties. Those movements are hostile to the state and antiparliamentarist and gradually institutionalize anti-Semitism and other kinds of racism.\n\nArendt concludes that while Italian fascism was a nationalist authoritarian movement, Nazism and Stalinism were totalitarian movements that sought to eliminate all restraints upon the power of the movement. She attributes the difference, in part, to a minimum necessary population: [T]otalitarian movements depend on the sheer force of numbers to such an extent that totalitarian regimes seem impossible, even under otherwise favorable circumstances, in countries with relatively small populations.... [E]ven Mussolini, who was so fond of the term \"totalitarian state,\" did not attempt to establish a full-fledged totalitarian regime and contented himself with dictatorship and one-party rule.\n\n\n=== Mechanics of totalitarian movements ===\nThe book's final section is devoted to describing the mechanics of totalitarian movements by focusing on Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Here, Arendt discusses the transformation of classes into masses, the role of propaganda in dealing with the non-totalitarian world, and the use of terror, essential to this form of government. Totalitarian movements are fundamentally different from autocratic regimes, says Arendt, insofar as autocratic regimes seek only to gain absolute political power and to outlaw opposition, while totalitarian regimes seek to dominate every aspect of everyone's life as a prelude to world domination. She states: ... Intellectual, spiritual, and artistic initiative is as dangerous to totalitarianism as the gangster initiative of the mob, and both are more dangerous than mere political opposition. The consistent persecution of every higher form of intellectual activity by the new mass leaders springs from more than their natural resentment against everything they cannot understand. Total domination does not allow for free initiative in any field of life, for any activity that is not entirely predictable. Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty. \nHannah Arendt considers the Soviet and Nazi regimes alongside European colonies in Africa and Asia, as their later and gruesome transformation due to the effect of imperial boomerang. She analyzes Russian pan-Slavism as a stage in the development of racism and totalitarianism. Her analysis was continued by Alexander Etkind in the book \"Internal colonization: Russia's imperial experience\".\nArendt discusses the use of front organizations, fake governmental agencies, and esoteric doctrines as a means of concealing the radical nature of totalitarian aims from the non-totalitarian world. Near the end of the book, Arendt writes that loneliness is a precondition for totalitarian domination, with people who are socially isolated being more likely to be attracted to totalitarian ideology and movements.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLe Monde placed the book in its list of 100 best books of the 20th century, and the National Review ranked it No. 15 on its list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute listed it among the 50 best non-fiction books of the century. The book made a major impact on Norman Podhoretz, who compared the pleasure of reading it to that of reading a great poem or novel.\nThe book has also attracted criticism, among them a piece in the Times Literary Supplement in 2009 by University of Chicago Professor Bernard Wasserstein. Wasserstein cited Arendt's systematic internalization of the various anti-Semitic and Nazi sources and books she was familiar with, which led to the use of many of these sources as authorities in the book. On the other hand, Gershom Scholem criticized Eichmann in Jerusalem but still praised the Origins of Totalitarianism. In several other places, Scholem mentions that he learned from Ernst Bloch that much Jewish literature and testimony in respect of some historical periods is not available due to pogroms, leaving antisemitic sources as the only surviving references for those periods.\nThe historian Emmanuelle Saada disputes Arendt's work and the general scholarly consensus that the rise of scientific racism directly correlates with the rise of colonialist imperialism. Saada contests that there is little evidence to support that ideas like those of Arthur de Gobineau, whom Arendt explicitly mentions, hold an important place in the scientific justification of European colonialism. Saada asserts that Arendt overemphasizes the role of scientific racism in forming modern totalitarianism, but in reality, Arendt should attribute blame to the \"bureaucratic racism\" she discusses elsewhere in the text.\nSuch scholars as Jürgen Habermas have supported Arendt in her 20th-century criticism of totalitarian readings of Marxism. That commentary on Marxism has indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx's apparent over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Habermas extends that critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason.\nHistorian John Lukacs was highly critical calling it a \"flawed and dishonest book\" that is \"unhistorical and shrilly verbose\", and that Arendt coverage of the Soviet Union was superficial.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nJohn A.

    "full_narrative": "On Revolution is a 1963 book by the political theorist Hannah Arendt, who presents a comparison of two of the main 18th-century revolutions: the American Revolution and the French Revolution, where they failed, where they succeeded and where they diverged from each other. \nShe views the American Revolution as more successful than the French Revolution, yet criticizes modern revolutionaries' tendency to model their actions on the latter. However, she also highlights that even the American Revolution fell short of its promise to provide public freedom and public happiness for everyone. With this she means the opportunity to partake in politics and the joy gained from shaping its own environment. She proposes council republics as a potentially superior revolutionary aim to achieve public participation and collective self-determination.\n\n\n== History ==\nTwelve years after the publication of her The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), which looked at what she considered failed revolutions, Arendt optimistically turned her attention to predict nonviolent movements to restore democratic governments around the world. Her predictions turned out to be largely true since those revolutions have been largely, though unconsciously, based on the principles she laid out.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn On Revolution, Arendt contrasts two major revolutions: the French Revolution, which ended in violence and terror, and the American Revolution, which established a more stable republic. She argues that while both aimed for freedom, they took vastly different paths due to their social and political contexts.\nThe core purpose of revolution is to achieve public freedom - the ability to participate in shaping one's political environment. This differs from private freedom (being left alone by the state) and requires first achieving liberation from economic or political constraints. Revolutions emerged only in the 18th century, enabled by Enlightenment thinking that society's structure wasn't divinely ordained but could be changed.\nThe French and American Revolutions diverged primarily due to their different circumstances:\n\nSocial Conditions: France had widespread poverty, making liberation from economic hardship the urgent priority. America's white population was relatively prosperous (though this ignored the enslaved population), allowing greater focus on establishing political freedom. Poverty, for Arendt, is detrimental to genuine politics (founded in ancient Athens), where public deliberation and persuasion. Poverty unleashes violence, as long as it subordinates humans to the urges of their biological necessity. Thus, it destroys the political realm from within.\nPolitical Experience: American colonists had extensive practice with self-governance and local decision-making due to their distance from Britain. French citizens lived under absolute monarchy with little democratic experience. Moreover, in America poverty was not a central concern.\nPower Structure: France's absolutist tradition led revolutionaries to centralize power, essentially replacing the king with \"the people\" while maintaining similar structures. America's experience with British constitutional monarchy influenced its focus on separated powers and checks and balances.\nValues: French revolutionaries emphasized compassion, focusing on immediate relief of suffering. Americans emphasized solidarity, enabling more reasoned, long-term planning.\nThe French concept of the \"general will\" - the supposed collective will of the people - proved problematic as it required interpretation by revolutionaries who claimed to speak for the masses, leading to purges of supposed enemies of the revolution.\nBoth revolutions struggled with establishing lasting authority. Pre-revolution authority often derived from religion or tradition, but revolutions needed new sources of legitimacy. The American solution was founding authority - \"we should have power because we created these rules together.\" However, this created a paradox: how to extend this founding experience to future generations?\nArendt argues that neither direct nor representative democracy fully achieves public freedom. Direct democracy is too volatile, while representative democracy limits citizen participation to voting. She proposes council republics as an alternative, with local councils sending representatives to higher levels of government. Such systems have emerged spontaneously in various revolutions but were typically suppressed by centralized party systems.\n\n\n== Comparison to other work of Arendt ==\nIn an earlier book, The Human Condition, Arendt argued that there were three states of human activity: labor, work, and action.  \"Labor\" is, essentially, a state of subsistence: doing what it takes to stay alive. For Arendt, that was the lowest form of human activity (all living creatures are capable of this). \"Work\" is the process of creating: a painter may create a great work of art, a writer may create a great work of fiction, etc. For Arendt, \"working\" is a worthwhile endeavor. Through works, people may remember someone, and if one's work is great enough, one may be remembered for thousands of years. Arendt notes that people still read the Iliad, and Homer will be remembered for as long as people keep telling his stories. However, Arendt argues the Iliad is still read only because of its protagonist, Achilles. For Arendt, Achilles embodies \"action.\" Only by interacting with others in some sort of public forum can your legacy be passed down through the generations; only by doing something truly memorable can a person achieve immortality.\nArendt believed that the leaders of the American Revolution were true \"actors\" (in the Arendtian sense) and that the US Constitution created \"publics\" that were conducive to action.  The leaders of the French Revolution, on the other hand, were too focused on subsistence (what Arendt called their \"demands for bread\"), as opposed to \"action.\" For a revolution to be truly successful, it must allow for, if not demand, that these publics be created. The leaders of the American Revolution created \"a public\" and acted within that space; their names will be remembered. The leaders of the French Revolution got their bread; their names have been forgotten.\n\n\n=== The \"social question\" ===\nOn Revolution provided conceptual underpinnings for the \"social question\" and the role of continental expansion in the \"origins\" of the American Revolution, reconfiguring Arendt's previous distinctions between systems of political ideas and philosophical pursuits, as well as between public and private space. Arendt's Neoplatonist preferences for a natalität pursuit of aletheia (not necessarily a synonym for \"truth\") over \"mere opinion\" was a factor as well. She had previously defined the \"vita activa as political action distinct from productive work or necessary labor. Only the growth of mass-market economies in the eighteenth century, she argued, broke down the integrity of a distinct public space that was the essential preserve of human spontaneity.\" In On Revolution and again in a subsequent speech, Arendt argued that \"the founding generation could still serve as a model to illuminate 'darker times' [which] demonstrated the way that she, too, held up the examples of the past to castigate the trajectory of the republic and to offer the point of foundation as a source of comfort and confidence. Significantly, her account of the precipitous position of the United States suggested that imperial overextension was a central cause of the corruption of the republic, where [historian J.G.A.] Pocock subsequently argued that its republican heritage was also the source of its expansiveness.\"  \nAlong with Pocock, Arendt examined Machiavellian ideas and James Harrington's seventeenth-century revamping of these ideas into proprietary landholdings for temporal stability, transmitted to late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century proponents of \"commerce.\" Arendt's \"non-Marxist\" tome shifted the focus of the \"social question\" from proletariat uprisings to the \"rise of political economy in the eighteenth century and its clash with [adherents of] the ancient vision of citizenship and liberty.\" Despite the transition from landholdings to an \"interests\"-based political economy, in enshrining themselves and narratives of customary and civil law into foundational moments that, in the absence of \"transcendent sources of authority\", became \"a space of time that preceded and would transcend one's life...the American founders had provided a unique example of how contingent and groundless origins could become a source for stability through time.\" She elucidated these arguments in the 1971 \"Thoughts on Politics and Revolution\", republished and expanded in the Crises of the Republic collection—which also included the \"On Violence\" essay that incited the 1970 Arendt-Agamben correspondence. According to Mira Siegelberg, both Arendt's and Pocock's arguments rested on the importance of historical thinking.\nArendt claimed that Zera Fink's book, and the 1942 article in which Fink first examined il Discorsi passages quoted in the works of James Harrington, partially germinated her research for On Revolution. Arendt confirmed that she was \"indebted to Zera Fink's important study The Classical Republicans...for the influence of Machiavelli upon Harrington and the influence of the ancients upon seventeenth-century English thought, see the excellent study by Zera S. Fink.\"\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nCritics of On Revolution include Eric Hobsbawm, who argued that Arendt's approach was selective in terms of cases and the evidence drawn from them. For example, he claimed that Arendt unjustifiably excludes revolutions that did not occur in the West, such as the 1911 Revolution, and that her description of the Russian Revolution is a mischaracterization. That made Hobsbawm find the link between Arendtian revolutions and history to be \"as incidental as that of medieval theologians and astronomers.\" He found further fault with how normative Arendt's conception of revolution describes its basis as \"explicit old-fashioned philosophical idealism.\"  For others, Arendt rooted the premises of On Revolution in grave misunderstandings of how material inequality influenced the birth of democracy in ancient Athens, in which she believed that economic concerns played a minor role. She also deemphasized an uneven distribution of wealth as both cause and consequence of the American Revolution. Moreover, she turned a blind eye on how social movements - like the movement of American Populism - \"incited by mass poverty, can inspire genuine political action.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArendt, Hannah (1976) [1951, New York: Schocken].

    "full_narrative": "\"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\" is an essay by American historian Richard Hofstadter, first published in Harper's Magazine in November 1964. It was the title essay in a book by the author the following year. Published soon after Arizona senator Barry Goldwater won the Republican Party presidential nomination over the more moderate Nelson Rockefeller, Hofstadter's article explores the influence of a particular style of conspiracy theory and \"movements of suspicious discontent\" throughout American history.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHofstadter's 1959 BBC radio lecture on \"The American Right Wing and the Paranoid Style\" was later revised and published as \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\" in the November 1964 Harper's Magazine. Hofstadter's initial focus on status anxiety tied to interest politics came from Franz Neumann's \"Anxiety and Politics\" (1954). Frankfurt School adherent Herbert Marcuse similarly connected status anxiety to interest politics in a eulogy for the deceased Neumann during a memorial service at Columbia University in 1955. Hofstadter shifted to studying the concepts of paranoia in what he termed \"pseudo-conservatism\", partly based on The Authoritarian Personality (1950) by another Frankfurt School member, Theodor W. Adorno, and admitted in 1967 that the book was an influential study. Hofstadter's 1954 paper on paranoia in pseudo-conservatism was presented at the 1954 Seminar of the State convened by post-industrial sociologist Daniel Bell, a 1950s Cold War liberal and post-1965 neoconservative. The provenance of the phrase \"paranoid style\" can be traced to the archived correspondence of then-BBC producer George MacBeth in a late January 1959 transmissive proposing the same to Hofstadter. On August 2, 1959, Hofstadter delivered his radio lecture on \"The American Right Wing and the Paranoid Style.\"\nHofstadter subsequently identified the \"post-McCarthy Right\" with \"pseudo-conservatism\", jettisoning \"status anxiety\" and \"status politics\" in favor of \"the paranoid style\" and \"projective politics.\" The notion of projective behavior in politics was influenced by Sigmund Freud's reduction of \"paranoid\" apocalypticism to a \"primitive religion\" in depth psychoanalysis, as well as Karl Mannheim's conception of worldview as a constellation of symbolic expressions. Both Mannheim and Hofstadter focused on the cognitive style in Baroque art and Mannerism as examples of visual cultures. This \"visual universe\" advanced a worldview, rather than sociolinguistics and Émile Durkheim's collective representations. In the words of Andrew McKenzie-McHarg, the paranoid style \"possessed precisely the requisite elasticity that allowed it to bridge the divide between the poles of the individual and the social (or, expressed somewhat differently, between the disciplines of psychology and sociology) ... the concept of style functions differently because it has the capacity to mediate between both the individual [premised on Weberian ideal types] and supra-individual levels ... Hofstadter's conceptual innovation had the advantage of allowing him to describe the style in which McCarthy had played 'the political game' as paranoid, while reserving judgment on his personal mental state.\"\nThe idea of the paranoid style transcended contexts, consequently leaving Hofstadter open to charges of devising both an ahistorical conceptual history and, counterintuitively, a history that emphasized change through linear time. Historian Nicolas Guilot argues that \"Hofstadter had done away with Mannheim's sociological attention for the conflicts among social groups that stood behind styles of thought...the subtle line that distinguished the mind that scanned the world for signs of conspiracies from the one that distilled symbols and rhetoric into a dangerous mindset unaffected by the vicissitudes of history had become blurred.\" As late as 1964, Hofstadter still self-identified as a Cold War liberal. He aimed his November essay in  Harper's Magazine at the Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign's conception of libertarianism in the United States.\nHofstadter adapted the essay from a Herbert Spencer lecture he delivered at Oxford University on November 21, 1963. An abridged version was first published in the November 1964 issue of Harper's Magazine, and was published as the titular essay in the book The Paranoid Style in American Politics, and Other Essays (1965).\n\n\n== Synopsis and themes ==\n\nIn developing the subject, Hofstadter initially establishes that his use of the phrase \"paranoid style\" was a borrowing from the clinical psychiatric term paranoid to describe a political personality, and acknowledges that the term is pejorative. Hofstadter asserts that, throughout American politics, politicians incite fear to sway voters toward a certain viewpoint. He argues that a \"political paranoiac\" engages in such demagoguery because they cannot accept society and seek to destroy the current order under the guise of a looming threat.\n\n\n== Historical applications ==\nHistorians have applied the paranoid category to other political movements, such as the conservative Constitutional Union Party of 1860. Hofstadter's approach was later applied to the rise of new right-wing groups, including the Christian Right and the Patriot Movement. In his book The Intellectuals and McCarthy: The Radical Specter (1967), the political scientist Michael Paul Rogin offered a thorough criticism of Hofstadter's thesis regarding the People's Party of the 1890s, also known as the Populist Party, and similar American progressive groups, showing that the ethnic and religious groups that supported McCarthy and other paranoid-style figures differ from those who supported the Populists and their successors, and thus that the origins of McCarthyism cannot be found within agrarian radical groups. Despite Rogin's work, the tendency to conflate left-wing populism and right-wing populism, ignoring significant differences between the two, remains a significant long-term effect of Hofstadter's work.\nAnother aspect of Hofstadter's thesis has been challenged by Samuel DeCanio's 2011 article \"Populism, Paranoia, and the Politics of Free Silver\", which argues that, instead of being a paranoid delusion, the People's Party's position regarding bankers' use of bribes to influence 19th-century monetary policy was largely correct. DeCanio offers evidence that the Coinage Act of 1873, legislation that eliminated bimetallism and which the Populists denounced as the \"Crime of 73\", was influenced by bribes that William Ralston, president of the Bank of California, paid to Henry Linderman, director of the Philadelphia Mint. DeCanio's article includes a copy of the actual check Ralston used to pay Linderman, indicating the Populists' claims were far more accurate than Hofstadter ever suspected. A 2020 study detailed the ways in which Donald Trump used the paranoid style described by Hofstadter substantially more than his post-World War II predecessors.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn a 2007 article in Harper's, Scott Horton wrote that \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\" was \"one of the most important and most influential articles published in the 155–year history of the magazine\". In a 2014 essay for Harper's, Thomas Frank was more critical, suggesting that Hofstadter's method had popularized a \"pseudopsychological approach to politics\". In 2020, the Library of America re-issued \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\" alongside other Hofstadter's essays, such as \"Anti-intellectualism in American Life\", as part of a volume edited by Princeton historian Sean Wilentz.\nJournalists continue to draw on the essay to analyze 21st-century public affairs. Laura Miller wrote in Salon in 2011 that \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\" reads like \"a playbook for the career of Glenn Beck, right down to the paranoid's 'quality of pedantry' and 'heroic strivings for 'evidence' embodied in Beck's chalkboard and piles of books. But Beck lacks an archenemy commensurate with his stratospheric ambitions, which makes him appear even more absurd to outsiders.\" Economist Paul Krugman titled a 2018 op-ed in The New York Times \"The Paranoid Style in G.O.P. Politics\" and explicitly referred to the 1964 essay. Researcher Travis View, writing in The Washington Post in 2019, described the QAnon conspiracy as an example of \"the paranoid style as described by Hofstadter\". Scholar Steve Snow argues that the Christian New Apostolic Reformation \"represents what Richard Hofstadter referred to as the modern paranoid style in American politics.\"\nCritics argued that Hofstadter erred in confining conspiracy theories to the political fringe. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick observed that Hofstadter's essay assumes \"a presumptive 'we'—apparently still practically everyone\" who regard conspiracy theories \"from a calm, understanding, and encompassing middle ground\". Sedgwick and later Gordon Fraser argued that conspiracy theories after the middle of the 20th century proliferated to such a degree that Hofstadter's imagined, rationally liberal audience no longer exists, if it ever existed in the first place.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmong the Truthers\nConspiracy: How the Paranoid Style Flourishes and Where It Comes From\nRadical right (United States)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull text of \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\".

    "full_narrative": "The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism is a 2007 book by Canadian author and social activist Naomi Klein.

The book challenges the narrative that free market capitalist policies have been welcomed by the inhabitants of regions where they have been implemented, and it argues that several man-made events, including the Iraq War, were intentionally undertaken with the goal of pushing through these unpopular policies in their wake.\nSome reviewers claimed the book oversimplifies political phenomena, while others lauded it as a compelling and important work. The book served as the main source of a 2009 documentary feature film with the same title directed by Michael Winterbottom.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book is divided into seven parts with a total of 21 chapters.\nPart 1 begins with a chapter on psychiatric shock therapy and the covert experiments conducted by the psychiatrist Ewen Cameron in collusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. The second chapter introduces Milton Friedman and his Chicago school of economics, whom Klein describes as leading a laissez-faire capitalist movement committed to creating free markets that are even less regulated than those that existed before the Great Depression.\nPart 2 discusses the use of the \"shock doctrine\" to transform South American economies in the 1970s, focusing on the 1973 coup in Chile led by General Augusto Pinochet and influenced by the Chicago Boys, a group of Chilean economists who had studied under Friedman at the Chicago School and were funded by the CIA. Klein connects torture with economic shock therapy.\nPart 3 covers attempts to apply the shock doctrine without the need for extreme violence against sections of the population. Klein says that Margaret Thatcher applied mild shock \"therapy\" facilitated by the Falklands War, while free market reform in Bolivia was possible due to a combination of pre-existing economic crises and the charisma of Jeffrey Sachs.\nPart 4 reports on how Klein thinks the shock doctrine was applied in Poland, China, South Africa, Russia, and the Four Asian Tigers. In Poland she discusses how the left-leaning trade union Solidarity won the country's 1989 legislative elections, but subsequently employed the shock doctrine due to IMF pressure. The section on China discusses the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests, and the liberalization of China's economy. In South Africa she explains that the negotiations to end apartheid resulted in economic policy that went against the core of the Freedom Charter. In Russia she describes how Boris Yeltsin took power after the collapse of the Soviet Union and crafted an economic policy that turned Russia into an oligarchy. Finally, she says that during the 1997 Asian financial crisis the Tiger Nations were forced to sell off numerous state enterprises to private, foreign companies.\nPart 5 introduces the \"Disaster Capitalism Complex\", a complex series of networks and influence employed by private companies that allows them to profit from disasters. She mirrors this new Disaster Capitalism Complex with the Military Industrial Complex and explains that both employ the blurring of the line between private and public, through tactics like the revolving door.\nPart 6 discusses the use of \"shock and awe\" in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, which Klein describes as the most comprehensive and full-scale implementation of the shock doctrine ever attempted, with mass privatization of Iraqi state-owned enterprises (including thousands of men being laid off) which is argued as contributing to the insurgency, since many of the unemployed became embittered toward the US as a result and joined insurgent groups afterward.\nPart 7 is about winners and losers of economic shock therapy – how small groups will often do very well by moving into luxurious gated communities while large sections of the population are left with decaying public infrastructure, declining incomes and increased unemployment. Klein describes economic policy after Hurricane Katrina, the 2004 Sri Lanka Tsunami, and the apartheid-style policy of the Israeli government toward Palestinians.\nThe Conclusion details the backlash against the \"shock doctrine\" and economic institutions which, in Klein's view, encourage it – like the World Bank and IMF. South America and Lebanon post-2006 are shown in a positive light, where politicians are already rolling back free-market policies, with some mention of the increased campaigning by community-minded activists in South Africa and China.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPaul B. Farrell from the Dow Jones Business News argued that The Shock Doctrine \"may be the most important book on economics in the 21st century.\" In The Guardian, John Gray hailed it as one of the \"very few books that really help us understand the present\", describing the work as \"both timely and devastating\". William S. Kowinski of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Klein's prose and wrote that the author \"may well have revealed the master narrative of our time.\"  In The Irish Times, Tom Clonan reported that she \"systematically and calmly demonstrates to the reader\" the way in which neoconservative figures were intimately linked to seismic events that \"resulted in the loss of millions of lives.\"\nIn the Los Angeles Times, Richard Rayner opined, \"Not everybody's going to agree with her, but this is reporting and history-writing in the tradition of Izzy Stone and Upton Sinclair. Klein upends assumptions and demands that we think – her book is thrilling, troubling and very dark.\" Stephen Amidon of the New York Observer affirmed the applicability of Klein's thesis to the Iraq War and argued, \"Seen through the lens of Naomi Klein's analysis, [it] makes horrifying sense, right down to Mr. Rumsfeld's decision to allow the looting of the nation's cultural identity.\" Shashi Tharoor noted the work's \"meticulous endnotes\" and stated, referring to globalization, that Klein \"has established herself as its principal naysayer.\" Katy Guest of The Independent praised the book as \"a compelling account of the way big business and politics use global disasters for their own ends.\" Juan Santos, winner of the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize, called the book \"as gripping as the best murder mystery, as well researched as the best investigative journalism – on a par with the work of a Seymour Hersh.\"\nThe Shock Doctrine was named one of the best books of 2007 by the Village Voice, Publishers Weekly, The Observer, and the Seattle Times. In 2019, The Guardian ranked it the 18th greatest book since 2000.\nThe Nobel Laureate and former Chief Economist of the World Bank Joseph Stiglitz wrote a review of The Shock Doctrine for The New York Times calling the parallel between economic shock therapy and the psychological experiments conducted by Ewen Cameron \"overdramatic and unconvincing\" and claiming that \"Klein is not an academic and cannot be judged as one. There are many places in her book where she oversimplifies.\" He also said, \"the case against these policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes\" and that the book contains \"a rich description of the political machinations required to force unsavory economic policies on resisting countries.\" \nShashi Tharoor in The Washington Post says that The Shock Doctrine takes Klein's criticism of capitalism an important step further. He also said Klein \"is too ready to see conspiracies where others might discern little more than the all-too-human pattern of chaos and confusion, good intentions and greed.\"\nSociologists as Ulrich Beck envisioned the society of risk as a new cultural value which posed risk as a commodity to be exchanged in globalized economies. As Klein observed, this suggested that disasters and capitalist economy was inevitably entwined. Some voices have praised the contributions of Klein to the study of the \"spectacle of disasters\".\nIn the London Review of Books, Stephen Holmes criticizes The Shock Doctrine as naïve, and opines that it conflates \"'free market orthodoxy' with predatory corporate behaviour.\" John Willman of the Financial Times describes it as \"a deeply flawed work that blends together disparate phenomena to create a beguiling – but ultimately dishonest – argument.\" Tom Redburn in The New York Times states that \"what she is most blind to is the necessary role of entrepreneurial capitalism in overcoming the inherent tendency of any established social system to lapse into stagnation.\"\nJonathan Chait wrote in The New Republic that Klein \"pays shockingly (but, given her premises, unsurprisingly) little attention to right-wing ideas. She recognizes that neoconservatism sits at the heart of the Iraq war project, but she does not seem to know what neoconservatism is; and she makes no effort to find out.\" Robert Cole from The Times said, \"Klein derides the 'disaster capitalism complex' and the profits and privatisations that go with it but she does not supply a cogently argued critique of free market principles, and without this The Shock Doctrine descends into a muddle of stories that are often worrying, sometimes interesting, and occasionally bizarre.\"\nEconomist Tyler Cowen, who called Klein's arguments \"ridiculous\" and the book a \"true economics disaster\", wrote on The New York Sun that the book contains \"a series of fabricated claims, such as the suggestion that Margaret Thatcher created the Falkland Islands crisis to crush the unions and foist unfettered capitalism upon an unwilling British public.\" Johan Norberg of the libertarian Cato Institute criticizes the book, saying that \"Klein's analysis is hopelessly flawed at virtually every level.\" Norberg finds fault with specifics of the analysis, such as with the Chinese government crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He argues that, rather than crushing opposition to pro-market reforms (as Klein would have it), the crackdown itself caused liberalization to stall for years. Klein responded on her website to both Norberg and Chait, stating that both had misrepresented her positions. Klein wrote that Norberg had erected a straw man by claiming that her book is about one man, Friedman, but that it is in fact about a \"multifaceted ideological trend\". Norberg again responded that Klein \"actually defends only one of her central claims that I criticized. Instead, she gives the impression that I have just tried to find small mistakes here and there in her book.\" He went on to say that the numbers Klein supplied in her reply reveal the statistics in her central argument to be \"rubbish\".\n\n\n== Later comments ==\nIn a piece related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Klein wrote in 2020 that a \"Pandemic Shock Doctrine\" was beginning to emerge and called it the \"Screen New Deal\".\n\n\n== Awards ==\nWinner of the Warwick Prize for Writing (2008/2009)\n\n\n== See also ==\nChicago school of economics\nConfessions of an Economic Hit Man\nCriticism of capitalism\nHistory of Russia (1991–present)#\"Shock_therapy\"\nFear mongering\nPolitical economy\nShock therapy (economics)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nArticles from theguardian.com\nCusack, John (2007). \"HuffPost Exclusive: My Interview with Naomi Klein\".

    "full_narrative": "No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies is a book by the Canadian author Naomi Klein. First published by Knopf Canada and Picador in December 1999, shortly after the 1999 Seattle WTO protests had generated media attention around such issues, it became one of the most influential books about the alter-globalization movement and an international bestseller.\n\n\n== Focus ==\nThe book focuses on branding and often makes connections with the anti-globalization movement. Throughout the four parts (\"No Space\", \"No Choice\", \"No Jobs\", and \"No Logo\"), Klein writes about issues such as sweatshops in the Americas and Asia, culture jamming, corporate censorship, and Reclaim the Streets. She pays special attention to the deeds and misdeeds of Nike, The Gap, McDonald's, Shell and Microsoft – and of their lawyers, contractors, and advertising agencies. \nWhile globalization appears frequently as a recurring theme, Klein rarely addresses the topic of globalization itself, and when she does, it is usually indirectly. She goes on to discuss globalization in much greater detail in her book Fences and Windows (2002).\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book comprises four sections. The first three sections deal with the negative effects of brand-oriented corporate activity, while the fourth and final section discusses various movements that arose in opposition to the corporate activities discussed in the rest of the book.\n\n\n=== \"No Space\" ===\nThe book begins by tracing the history of brands. Klein argues that there has been a shift in the usage of branding and gives examples of this shift to \"anti-brand\" branding. Early examples of brands were often used to put a recognizable face on factory-produced products. These slowly gave way to the idea of selling lifestyles. According to Klein, in response to an economic crash in the late 1980s (due to the Latin American debt crisis, Black Monday (1987), the savings and loan crisis, and the Japanese asset price bubble), corporations began to seriously rethink their approach to marketing and to target the youth demographic, as opposed to the baby boomers, who had previously been considered a much more valuable segment.\nThe book discusses how brand names such as Nike or Pepsi expanded beyond the mere products which bore their names, and how these names and logos began to appear everywhere. As this happened, the brands' obsession with the youth market drove them to further associate themselves with whatever the youth considered \"cool\". Along the way, the brands attempted to associate their names with everything from movie stars and athletes to grassroots social movements.\nKlein argues that large multinational corporations consider the marketing of a brand name to be more important than the actual manufacture of products; this theme recurs in the book, and Klein suggests that it helps explain the shift to production in Third World countries in such industries as clothing, footwear, and computer hardware.\nThis section also looks at ways in which brands have \"muscled\" their presence into the school system, and how in doing so, they have pipelined advertisements into the schools and used their position to gather information about the students. Klein argues that this is part of a trend toward targeting younger and younger consumers.\n\n\n=== \"No Choice\" ===\nIn the second section, Klein discusses how brands use their size and clout to limit the number of choices available to the public – whether through market dominance (e.g., Wal-Mart) or through aggressive invasion of a region (e.g., Starbucks). Klein argues that each company's goal is to become the dominant force in its respective field. Meanwhile, other corporations, such as Sony or Disney, simply open their own chains of stores, preventing the competition from even putting their products on the shelves.\nThis section also discusses the way that corporations merge with one another in order to add to their ubiquity and provide greater control over their image. ABC News, for instance, is allegedly under pressure not to air any stories that are overly critical of Disney, its parent company. Other chains, such as Wal-Mart, often threaten to pull various products off their shelves, forcing manufacturers and publishers to comply with their demands. This might mean driving down manufacturing costs or changing the artwork or content of products like magazines or albums so they better fit with Wal-Mart's image of family friendliness.\nAlso discussed is the way that corporations abuse copyright laws in order to silence anyone who might attempt to criticize their brand.\n\n\n=== \"No Jobs\" ===\nIn this section, the book takes a darker tone and looks at the way in which manufacturing jobs move from local factories to foreign countries, and particularly to places known as export processing zones. Such zones often have no labor laws, leading to dire working conditions.\nThe book then shifts back to North America, where the lack of manufacturing jobs has led to an influx of work in the service sector, where most of the jobs are for minimum wage and offer no benefits. The term \"McJob\" is introduced, defined as a job with poor compensation that does not keep pace with inflation, inflexible or undesirable hours, little chance of advancement, and high levels of stress. Meanwhile, the public is being sold the perception that these jobs are temporary employment for students and recent graduates, and therefore need not offer living wages or benefits.\nAll of this is set against a backdrop of massive profits and wealth being produced within the corporate sector. The result is a new generation of employees who have come to resent the success of the companies they work for. This resentment, along with rising unemployment, labour abuses abroad, disregard for the environment, and the ever-increasing presence of advertising breeds a new disdain for corporations.\n\n\n=== \"No Logo\" ===\nThe final section of the book discusses various movements that have sprung up during the 1990s. These include Adbusters magazine and the culture-jamming movement, as well as Reclaim the Streets and the McLibel trial. Less radical protests are also discussed, such as the various movements aimed at putting an end to sweatshop labour.\nKlein concludes by contrasting consumerism and citizenship, opting for the latter. \"When I started this book,\" she writes, \"I honestly didn't know whether I was covering marginal atomized scenes of resistance or the birth of a potentially broad-based movement. But as time went on, what I clearly saw was a movement forming before my eyes.\"\n\n\n== Responses ==\n\nAfter the book's release, Klein was heavily criticized by the newspaper The Economist, leading to a broadcast debate with Klein and the magazine's writers, dubbed \"No Logo vs. Pro Logo\".\nThe 2004 book The Rebel Sell (published as Nation of Rebels in the United States) specifically criticized No Logo, stating that turning the improving quality of life in the working class into a fundamentally anti-market ideology is shallow.\nNike published a point-by-point response to the book, refuting each of the statements Klein had made about the company's labor practices.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2000, No Logo was short-listed for the Guardian First Book Award in 2000.\nIn 2001, the book won the following awards:\n\nThe 2001 National Business Book Award\nThe 2001 French Prix Médiations\n\n\n== Editions ==\nSeveral imprints of No Logo exist, including a hardcover first edition, a subsequent hardcover edition, and a paperback. A 10th anniversary edition was published by Fourth Estate that includes a new introduction by the author. Translations from the original English into several other languages have also been published. The subtitle, \"Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies\", was dropped in some later editions.\n\n\n== Video ==\nNaomi Klein explains her ideas in the 40-minute video No Logo – Brands, Globalization & Resistance (2003), directed by Sut Jhally.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMembers of the English rock group Radiohead recommended the book to fans on their website and was rumored to have considered calling the album Kid A \"No Logo\" for a time. Argentine artist Indio Solari wrote a song for his first solo album named \"Nike es la cultura\" (\"Nike is the culture\"), in which he says, \"You shout No Logo! Or you don't shout No Logo! Or you shout No Logo No!\" in reference to this book.\nArgentine-American rock singer Kevin Johansen wrote a song, \"Logo\", inspired by Klein's book. A copy of No Logo is even used in the official video for the song.\nDave Longstreth of american indie-pop band Dirty Projectors names the book and its author in their 2016 song \"Keep Your Name\" \n\n\n== See also ==\nChina Blue\nCulture industry\nOccupy movement\nThe Society of the Spectacle\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nNaomi Klein's website\nNational Business Book Award – No Logo\nNo Logo - Brands, Globalization & Resistance (2003 40 minute video) at IMDb\nCBC Archives – CBC Television HotType N.

In 2011, Time  named it among the 100 most influential books written in English since 1923.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nCampbell explores the theory that mythological narratives frequently share a fundamental structure. The similarities of these myths brought Campbell to write his book in which he details the structure of the monomyth. He calls the motif of the archetypal narrative, \"the hero's adventure\". In a well-known passage from the introduction to The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell summarizes the monomyth:\n\nA hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.\nIn laying out the monomyth, Campbell describes a number of stages or steps along this journey. \"The hero's adventure\" begins in the ordinary world. He must depart from the ordinary world, when he receives a call to adventure. With the help of a mentor, the hero will cross a guarded threshold, leading him to a supernatural world, where familiar laws and order do not apply. There, the hero will embark on a road of trials, where he is tested along the way. The archetypal hero is sometimes assisted by allies. As the hero faces the ordeal, he encounters the greatest challenge of the journey. Upon rising to the challenge, the hero will receive a reward, or boon. Campbell's theory of the monomyth continues with the inclusion of a metaphorical death and resurrection. The hero must then decide to return with this boon to the ordinary world. The hero then faces more trials on the road back. Upon the hero's return, the boon or gift may be used to improve the hero's ordinary world, in what Campbell calls, the application of the boon.\nWhile many myths do seem to follow the outline of Campbell's monomyth, there is some variance in the inclusion and sequence of some of the stages. Still, there is an abundance of literature and folklore that follows the motif of the archetypal narrative, paralleling the more general steps of \"Departure\" (sometimes called Separation), \"Initiation\", and \"Return\".  \"Departure\" deals with the hero venturing forth on the quest, including the call to adventure. \"Initiation\" refers to the hero's adventures that will test him along the way. The last part of the monomyth is the \"Return\", which follows the hero's journey home.\nCampbell studied religious, spiritual, mythological and literary classics including the stories of Osiris, Prometheus, the Buddha, Moses, Mohammed, and Jesus. The book cites the similarities of the stories, and references them as he breaks down the structure of the monomyth.\nThe book includes a discussion of \"the hero's journey\" by using the Freudian concepts popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Campbell's theory incorporates a mixture of Jungian archetypes, unconscious forces, and Arnold van Gennep's structuring of rites of passage rituals to provide some illumination. \"The hero's journey\" continues to influence artists and intellectuals in contemporary arts and culture, suggesting a basic usefulness for Campbell's insights beyond mid-20th century forms of analysis.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCampbell used the work of early-20th-century theorists to develop his model of the hero (see also structuralism), including Freud (particularly the Oedipus complex), Carl Jung (archetypal figures and the collective unconscious), and Arnold Van Gennep. Van Gennep contributed the concept of there being three stages of The Rites of Passage. Campbell translated this into Separation, Initiation and Return. He also looked to the work of psychoanalyst Otto Rank and ethnographers James George Frazer and Franz Boas. \nCampbell was a noted scholar of James Joyce, having co-authored A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake with Henry Morton Robinson. Campbell borrowed the term monomyth from Joyce's Finnegans Wake. In addition, Joyce's Ulysses was also highly influential in the structuring of the archetypal motif. \n\n\n=== Publishing history ===\n\nThe book was originally published by the Bollingen Foundation through Pantheon Press as the seventeenth title in the Bollingen Series. This series was taken over by Princeton University Press, who published the book through 2006. Originally issued in 1949 and revised by Campbell in 1968, The Hero with a Thousand Faces has been reprinted a number of times. Reprints issued after the release of Star Wars in 1977 used the image of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker on the cover. Princeton University Press issued a commemorative printing of the second edition in 2004 on the occasion of the joint centennial of Campbell's birth and the Press's founding with an added foreword by Clarissa Pinkola Estés.\nA third edition, compiled by the Joseph Campbell Foundation and published by New World Library, was released as the twelfth title in the Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series in July 2008.\nThe Hero with a Thousand Faces has been translated into over twenty languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Turkish, Dutch, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Romanian, Czech, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Russian, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Hebrew, and has sold well over a million copies worldwide.\n\n\n== Artists influenced by the work ==\n\nIn Pathways to Bliss: Mythology and Personal Transformation, a book drawn from Campbell's late lectures and workshops, he says about artists and the monomyth:\n\nArtists are magical helpers. Evoking symbols and motifs that connect us to our deeper selves, they can help us along the heroic journey of our own lives. [...]\nThe artist is meant to put the objects of this world together in such a way that through them you will experience that light, that radiance which is the light of our consciousness and which all things both hide and, when properly looked upon, reveal.\nThe hero's journey is one of the universal patterns through which that radiance shows brightly. What I think is that a good life is one hero journey after another. Over and over again, you are called to the realm of adventure, you are called to new horizons. Each time, there is the same problem: do I dare? And then if you do dare, the dangers are there, and the help also, and the fulfillment or the fiasco. There's always the possibility of a fiasco.\n\nBut there's also the possibility of bliss.\n\n\n=== Influences on artists ===\nThe Hero with a Thousand Faces has influenced a number of artists, filmmakers, musicians, producers and poets. Some of these figures include Bob Dylan, George Lucas, Mark Burnett and Jim Morrison. Additionally, Mickey Hart, Bob Weir, and Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead had long noted Campbell's influence and participated in a seminar with Campbell in 1986, entitled \"From Ritual to Rapture\".\n\n\n==== In film ====\nStanley Kubrick introduced Arthur C. Clarke to the book during the writing of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nGeorge Lucas' deliberate use of Campbell's theory of the monomyth in the making of the Star Wars movies is well documented. On the DVD release of the famous colloquy between Campbell and Bill Moyers, filmed at Lucas' Skywalker Ranch and broadcast in 1988 on PBS as The Power of Myth, Campbell and Moyers discussed Lucas's use of The Hero with a Thousand Faces in making his films. Lucas himself discussed how Campbell's work affected his approach to storytelling and film-making.\n\n\n==== In games ====\nJenova Chen, lead designer at thatgamecompany, also cites The Hero's Journey as the primary inspiration for the PlayStation 3 game Journey (2012).\n\n\n==== In literature ====\nChristopher Vogler, a Hollywood film producer and writer, wrote a memo for Disney Studios on the use of The Hero with a Thousand Faces as a guide for scriptwriters; this memo influenced the creation of such films as Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994). Vogler later expanded the memo and published it as the book The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers, which became the inspiration for a number of successful Hollywood films and is believed to have been used in the development of the Matrix series.\nNovelist Richard Adams acknowledges a debt to Campbell's work, and specifically to the concept of the monomyth. In his best known work, Watership Down, Adams uses extracts from The Hero with a Thousand Faces as chapter epigrams.\n\nAuthor Neil Gaiman, whose work is frequently seen as exemplifying the monomyth structure, says that he started The Hero with a Thousand Faces but refused to finish it: \"I think I got about half way through The Hero with a Thousand Faces and found myself thinking if this is true—I don't want to know. I really would rather not know this stuff. I’d rather do it because it's true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is.\"Many scholars and reviewers have noted how closely J. K. Rowling's popular Harry Potter books hewed to the monomyth schema.\n\n\n==== In television ====\nDan Harmon, the creator of the TV shows Community and Rick and Morty, has used the monomyth as inspiration for his work.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDavid R. Dunham reviewed The Hero with a Thousand Faces for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces is not an easy book to read. While it isn't overly dry, it isn't exactly entertaining, either. It took me three starts to get through it. This may be due to the fact that I don't usually read scholarly books for entertainment.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nThe Golden Bough by James George Frazer\nThe Iron Dream by Norman Spinrad\nThe Seven Basic Plots by Christopher Booker\nArchetypal literary criticism\nVladimir Propp\nAarne–Thompson classification systems\nBildungsroman\nThe Myth of the Birth of the Hero by Otto Rank\nKishu ryūritan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCampbell, Joseph.

(The series was broadcast on television the year following his death.) In these discussions Campbell presents his ideas about comparative mythology and the ongoing role of myth in human society. These talks include excerpts from Campbell's seminal work The Hero with a Thousand Faces\n\n\n== Documentary series ==\nThe documentary series Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth was broadcast in six parts:\n\nEpisode 1: The Hero's Adventure  (first broadcast June 21, 1988 on PBS)\nAbout Campbell, hero types, hero deeds, Jesus Christ, the Buddha, Krishna, movie heroes, Star Wars as a metaphor, an Iroquois story: the refusal of suitors, dragons, dreams and Jungian psychology, “follow your bliss,” consciousness in plants, Gaia, Chartres Cathedral, spirituality vs. economics, emerging myths, “Earthrise” as a symbol.\n\nEpisode 2: The Message of the Myth (first broadcast June 22, 1988 on PBS)\nCreation myths, transcending duality, pairs of opposites, God vs. Nature, sin, morality, participation in sorrow, the Gospel of Thomas, Old Time Religion, computers, religion as “software,” the story of Indra: “What a great boy am I!,” participation in society.\n\nEpisode 3: The First Storytellers (first broadcast June 23, 1988 on PBS)\nAnimal memories, harmonization with body and life-cycle, consciousness vs. its vehicle, killing for food, story: “The Buffalo's Wife,” buffalo massacre, initiation ritual, rituals diminishing, crime increasing, artists, the Shaman, the center of the world.\n\nEpisode 4: Sacrifice and Bliss (first broadcast June 24, 1988 on PBS)\nChief Seattle, the sacred Earth, agricultural renewal, human sacrifice, sacrifice of the Mass, transcendence of death, story: “The Green Knight,” societal dictates vs. following bliss, “hidden hands” guiding life's work.\n\nEpisode 5: Love and the Goddess (first broadcast June 25, 1988 on PBS)\nThe Troubadours, Eros, romantic love, Tristan, libido vs. credo, separation from love, Satan, loving your enemy, the Crucifixion as atonement, virgin birth, the story of Isis, Osiris and Horus, the Madonna, the Big Bang, the correlation between the earth or mother Goddess and images of fertility (the sacred feminine).\n\nEpisode 6: Masks of Eternity (first broadcast June 26, 1988 on PBS)\nIdentifying with the infinite, the circle as a symbol, clowns and masks, epiphanies and James Joyce, artistic arrest, the monstrous as sublime, the dance of Shiva, that which is beyond words.\n\n\n== Companion book ==\n\nThe companion book for the series, The Power of Myth (Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers, and editor Betty Sue Flowers), was released in 1988 at the same time the series aired on PBS. In the editor's note to The Power of Myth, Flowers credits Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, as \"the Doubleday editor, whose interest in the ideas of Joseph Campbell was the prime mover in the publication of this book.\" The book follows the format of the documentary and provides additional discussions not included in the original six-hour release.  Chapters:\n\nMyth and the Modern World\nThe Journey Inward\nThe First Storytellers\nSacrifice and Bliss\nThe Hero's Adventure\nThe Gift of the Goddess\nTales of Love and Marriage\nMasks of Eternity\nThe Tale of Buddha\nThe Power of Myth is based on the interviews between Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers that were the basis for the acclaimed television series. It deals with the universality and evolution of myths in the history of the human race and the place of myths in modern society. Campbell blends accounts of his own upbringing and experience with stories from many cultures and civilizations to present the reader with his most compelling thesis that modern society is going through a transition from the old mythologies and traditions to a new way of thinking where a global mythology will emerge.\nSome of the material in the first chapter comes from Campbell's previously published books, The Hero with a Thousand Faces and The Masks of God. The main theme of the book is the universality of myths—what Campbell calls \"mankind's one great story\"— that occur throughout the history of mankind, no matter which epoch or whichever culture or society is considered. Myths are the body of stories and legends that a people perceive as being an integral part of their culture. Before the invention of writing, these stories and legends were handed down from generation to generation in the form of rituals and oral traditions. The reappearance of certain themes, time and again, in different mythologies, leads to the realization that these themes portray universal and eternal truths about mankind.\nCampbell defines the function of a mythology as the provision of a cultural framework for a society or people to educate their young, and to provide them with a means of coping with their passage through the different stages of life from birth to death. In a general sense myths include religion as well and the development of religion is an intrinsic part of a society's culture. A mythology is inevitably bound to the society and time in which it occurs and cannot be divorced from this culture and environment. This is true even though Western society previously learnt from, and was informed by, the mythology of other cultures by including the study of Greek and Roman writings as part of its heritage.\nThe record of the history of the development of a culture and society is embodied in its mythology. For example, the Bible describes the evolution of the Judeo-Christian concept of God from the time when the Jews were in Babylon and the god they worshiped corresponded to a local tribal god, to when the concept became that of a world savior as a result of the Hebrews becoming a major force in the East Mediterranean region. The geographic context of a specific mythology also plays a role in its evolution. The physical scope of Biblical mythology was limited to the general area of the Middle East but in other parts of the world, Chinese and Aztec religions and cultures emerged as separate and distinct belief systems. When different cultures expand their spheres of influence they eventually come into contact with each other, and the outcome of the collision, be it conquest, subjugation, or amalgamation, will be evident in the resultant mythology.\nThe form and function of mythology in the modern world is the main topic of this chapter and to illustrate his ideas, Campbell recounts aspects of his own earlier life. Without specifically stating it, the assumption is made that the modern world under consideration is that of Campbell's world—the Christian-based, urbanized culture of North America, the so-called Modern Western Society.\nCampbell describes his own upbringing as a Roman Catholic and his early fascination with the myths and stories of the American Indians. He recalls the excitement he felt when he realized that the motifs of creation, death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, which the nuns were teaching him at his school, also occurred in American Indian myths. This was the beginning of his lifelong interest in comparative mythology. Later on in life he found the same universal themes in Hinduism and in the medieval Arthurian legends.\nThe discussion considers the role of myth and ritual in contemporary society. Contemporary rituals are carried out to mark special events in private lives, such as an individual's marriage or enlistment in a branch of the armed forces and on public occasions such as the inauguration of civil and national leaders. In the Introduction to the book, Moyers recalls Campbell's description of the solemn state funeral after the assassination of John F. Kennedy as an \"illustration of the high service of ritual to a society,\" and where Campbell identifies the ritualized occasion as fulfilling a great social necessity.\nIn general, however, Campbell and Moyers reach the conclusion that there is a lack of effective mythology and ritual in modern American society. They find nothing that compares with the powerful puberty rituals of primitive societies. They claim that the exclusion of classical studies from the modern educational syllabus has led to a lack of awareness of the mythological foundations of western society's heritage. This, combined with an increased materialism and emphasis on technology, has led to modern youth in New York becoming alienated from the mainstream of society and inventing their own morality, initiations and gangs.\nMarriage, as an example of a paramount modern social institution, becomes the next subject of discussion. Campbell differentiates between marriage and love affairs and imparts some very lofty ideals to marriage, in contrast to love affairs, that he categorically states inevitably end in disappointment. True marriage, in Campbell's opinion, embodies a spiritual identity and invokes the image of an incarnate God. Campbell and Moyers agree that the main objective of marriage is not the birth of children and the raising of families. They discard the concept of perpetuation of the human species as being the primary function of marriage and relegate this to a first stage. This first stage is followed by a second one where the offspring have departed into the world and only the couple is left. Campbell invokes the image of marriage as being an ordeal in which the ego is sacrificed to a relationship in which two have become one. This, he states, is a mythological image that embodies the sacrifice of the visible for a transcendent good. Campbell labels this stage of marriage as the alchemical stage. On the subject of the ritual of marriage, Campbell and Moyers complain that it has lost its force and has become a mere remnant of the original; they contend that the ritual that once conveyed an inner reality is now merely form.\nThe interviews between Campbell and Moyers are recorded at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch. Campbell and Lucas became friends when Lucas publicly acknowledged the influence Campbell's writings had on the development of his hugely successful film \"Star Wars.\" Campbell expresses great enthusiasm for this film, a film that he says conforms to classical mythological legends. So it is not surprising that there are many references to the characters from \"Star Wars\" throughout the book. In a similar fashion, John Wayne is identified as a modern myth and Campbell recalls Douglas Fairbanks as having been a boyhood hero.\nAt the beginning of this chapter, and in other parts of the book, Campbell states that modern society lacks the stability it previously derived from being educated in the mythology and legends of the Greek and Roman classics. Campbell and Moyers agree that there is no effective mythology in modern society by which individuals can relate to their role in the world. An analysis of the national symbols of the United States is used by Campbell to illustrate the ability for myths to incorporate the beliefs of a whole society and to provide the mythology to unify a nation. More recently, when the image of the Earth, taken from the lunar landings, was published, it led to the universal realization that human beings must identify with the entire planet. This concept of the emergence of a new mythology based on global aspects of life is reiterated several times by Campbell.\n\n\n== Star Wars ==\nIn the first episode of the series, The Hero's Adventure, and the fifth chapter of the book, \"The Hero's Adventure,\" Moyers and Campbell discuss George Lucas' report that Campbell's work directly influenced the creation of the Star Wars films.\nMoyers and Lucas filmed an interview 12 years later in 1999, modeled after The Power of Myth. It was called the  Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas & Bill Moyers and further discussed the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas' films.\n\n\n== Errata ==\nThe words attributed to Chief Seattle, read by Campbell in the fourth episode of the series, were actually written by Ted Perry for a 1972 ecology film called Home. Perry adapted the text from newspaper accounts that were, in turn, published years after Chief Seattle delivered the actual speech.\n\n\n== Views on religious fundamentalism ==\nDuring the interview, Campbell reveals his views on religious fundamentalism in the modern world.\n\nOn this immediate level of life and structure, myths offer life models. But the models have to be appropriate to the time in which you are living, and our time has changed so fast that what was proper fifty years ago is not proper today. The virtues of the past are the vices of today. And many of what were thought to be the vices of the past are the necessities of today. The moral order has to catch up with the moral necessities of actual life in time, here and now. And that is what we are not doing. The old-time religion belongs to another age, another people, another set of human values, another universe. By going back you throw yourself out of sync with history. Our kids lose their faith in the religions that were taught to them, and they go inside.\" \n\n\n== Related media ==\nPrint\n\nMoyers, Bill and Joseph Campbell. The Power of Myth (1988).

    "full_narrative": "The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women is a nonfiction book by Naomi Wolf, originally published in 1990 by Chatto & Windus in the UK and William Morrow & Co (1991) in the United States. It was republished in 2002 by HarperPerennial with a new introduction.\nThe basic premise of The Beauty Myth is that as the social power and prominence of women have increased, the pressure they feel to adhere to unrealistic social standards of physical beauty has also grown stronger because of commercial influences on the mass media. This pressure leads to unhealthy behaviors by women and a preoccupation with appearance in both sexes, and it compromises the ability of women to be effective in and accepted by society.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nIn her introduction, Wolf offers the following analysis: The more legal and material hindrances women have broken through, the more strictly and heavily and cruelly images of female beauty have come to weigh upon us... [D]uring the past decade, women breached the power structure; meanwhile, eating disorders rose exponentially and cosmetic surgery became the fastest-growing specialty... [P]ornography became the main media category, ahead of legitimate films and records combined, and thirty-three thousand American women told researchers that they would rather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal...More women have more money and power and scope and legal recognition than we have ever had before; but in terms of how we feel about ourselves physically, we may actually be worse off than our unliberated grandmothers.\nWolf also posits the idea of an \"iron maiden\", an intrinsically unattainable standard that is then used to punish women physically and psychologically for their failure to achieve and conform to it. Wolf criticizes the fashion and beauty industries as exploitative of women, but claims the beauty myth extends into all areas of human functioning. Wolf writes that women should have \"the choice to do whatever we want with our faces and bodies without being punished by an ideology that is using attitudes, economic pressure, and even legal judgments regarding women's appearance to undermine us psychologically and politically\". Wolf argued that women were under assault by the \"beauty myth\" in five areas: work, religion, sex, violence, and hunger. Ultimately, Wolf argues for a relaxation of normative standards of beauty.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nWolf's book was a quick bestseller, garnering intensely polarized responses from the public and mainstream media, but winning praise from many feminists. Second-wave feminist Germaine Greer wrote that The Beauty Myth was \"the most important feminist publication since The Female Eunuch\", and Gloria Steinem wrote: \"The Beauty Myth is a smart, angry, insightful book, and a clarion call to freedom. Every woman should read it.\" British novelist Fay Weldon called the book \"essential reading for the New Woman\", and Betty Friedan wrote in Allure magazine that \"The Beauty Myth and the controversy it is eliciting could be a hopeful sign of a new surge of feminist consciousness.\"\nWith the publication of The Beauty Myth, Wolf became a leading spokesperson of what was later described as the third wave of the feminist movement.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nIn Who Stole Feminism? (1994) Christina Hoff Sommers criticized Wolf for publishing the claim that 150,000 women were dying every year from anorexia in the United States, writing that the actual figure was more likely to be somewhere between 100 and 400 per year.\nSimilarly, a 2004 paper compared Wolf's eating disorder statistics to statistics from peer-reviewed epidemiological studies and concluded that 'on average, an anorexia statistic in any edition of The Beauty Myth should be divided by eight to get near the real statistic.' Schoemaker calculated that there are about 525 annual deaths from anorexia, 286 times less than Wolf's statistic.\nHumanities scholar Camille Paglia also criticized the book, arguing that Wolf's historical research and analysis was flawed.\n\n\n== Connection to women's studies ==\nWithin women's studies, scholars posit that the Beauty Myth is a powerful force that keeps women focused on and distracted by body image and that provides both men and women with a way to judge and limit women due to their physical appearance. Magazines, posters, television ads and social media sites are, in this hypothesis, among the many platforms today that perpetuate beauty standards for both men and women. The daily presence and circulation of these platforms, it is argued, makes escaping these ideals almost impossible. Women and men alike are faced with ideal bodies, bodies that are marketed as attainable through diets and gym memberships. However, for most people these beauty standards are neither healthy nor achievable through diet or exercise. Women often place a greater importance on weight loss than on maintaining a healthy average weight, and they commonly make great financial and physical sacrifices to reach these goals. Yet failing to embody these ideals makes women targets of criticism and societal scrutiny.\nPerfectionistic, unattainable goals are cited as an explanation for the increasing rates of plastic surgery and anorexia nervosa. Anorexia is one of the most prevalent eating disorders in Western countries \"affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States alone.\" Of this number, more than 90 percent of anorexics are girls and young women. They suffer from a \"serious mental health disease that involves compulsive dieting and drastic weight loss\". This weight loss is the result of deliberate self-starvation to achieve a thinner appearance, and it is frequently associated with the disorder bulimia. Anorexia's deep psychological roots make it difficult to treat and often extend the recovery process into a life-long journey.\nSome feminists believe the beauty myth is part of a system that reinforces male dominance. According to Naomi Wolf, as women increasingly focus their attention on their physical appearance, their focus on equal rights and treatment takes a lower priority. The same is argued in Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, in which she recounts the effects of societies that condition adolescent girls and young women to behave in feminine ways. According to Beauvoir, these changes encompass a \"huge array of social expectations including physical appearance, but unlike the social expectations on boys, the social expectations on girls and women usually inhibit them from acting freely\". In her argument, Beauvoir cites things such as clothing, make-up, diction and manners as subjects of scrutiny that women face but men do not.\nAccording to Dr. Vivian Diller's book Face It: What Women Really Feel as their Looks Change and What to Do About It, \"most women agree, reporting the good looks continue to be associated with respect, legitimacy, and power in their relationships\". Diller writes that in the commercial world, hiring, evaluations and promotions based on physical appearance push women to place the importance of beauty above that of their work and skills.\n\n\n== Film ==\nIn February 2010, a filmed 42-minute lecture delivered by Naomi Wolf at California Lutheran University, entitled The Beauty Myth: The Culture of Beauty, Psychology, & the Self, was released on DVD by Into the Classroom Media.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRebecca Onion, \"A Modern Feminist Classic Changed My Life.

In Bloom's view, openness undermines critical thinking and eliminates the point of view that defines cultures. The book became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nBloom critiques contemporary higher education in the United States and how he sees it is failing its students, criticizing modern movements in philosophy and the humanities. Throughout the book, he attacks the moral relativism that he claims has taken over American universities for the barrier it constructs to the notions of truth, critical thinking, and genuine knowledge. Bloom claims that students in the 1980s have prioritized the immediate, blind relegation of prejudice as inferiority of thought, and therefore have closed their minds, as the title suggests, to asking the right questions, so that prejudice may be eradicated through logic and critical thinking, as opposed to empty, baseless instinct. Bloom writes, \"Prejudices, strong prejudices, are visions about the way things are. ... Error is indeed our enemy, but it alone points to the truth and therefore deserves our respectful treatment. The mind that has no prejudices at the outset is empty.\"\n\n\n=== \"Students\" ===\nIn part one, titled \"Students\", Bloom details how the young American mindset, the books, music, relationships, and other aspects of American popular culture contribute to the sanctimony of what he perceives to be dull, lazy minds in American universities today. Bloom contends that the \"clean slate\", with which students enter universities, at first made them more susceptible to genuinely embracing the studies of philosophy and logic. Soon enough, because of \"[t]he improved education of the vastly expanded middle class [that] weakened the family's authority\", there came a \"gradual stilling of the old political and religious echoes\" in the students Bloom encountered later in his teaching career. He credits the narrowing and flattening of the American college experience to these phenomena.\nBloom then delves into what he believes is the great books dilemma. He believes that the great books of Western thought have been devalued as a source of wisdom—but more importantly, that \"our students have lost the practice of and the taste of reading\". Because of this, students are unable to derive their beliefs from evidence, from central texts, or any print source at all. Bloom contends that without an understanding of important older texts, such as Plato's Republic or Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince, modern students lack any reference point with which they can critically think about or address current events. Students are instead left with vague and abstract ideas of \"good\" and \"evil\".\nBloom notes that the \"addiction to music\" he observes in modern students is unparalleled, and has been for centuries. But even this, he says, contributes to the closing of the young American mind. He notes that fewer and fewer students have a surface level, let alone nuanced, understanding of classical music, and that instead, \"rock music is as unquestioned and un-problematic as the air the students breathe.\" Pop music, he believes, employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young and to persuade them that their petty rebelliousness is authentic politics, when, in fact, they are being controlled by the money-managers whom successful performers like Mick Jagger quietly serve. He regards the ubiquity of overly sexual overtones in 1980s rock music, and what he perceives to be a subsequent corruption of young minds, as a signal of \"parents' loss of control over the children's moral education at a time when no one else is seriously concerned with it.\" \nBloom's conclusion about the effects of music on education is that its oversexualization in the late 20th century makes it \"very difficult for [students] to have a passionate relationship with the art and thought that are the substance of liberal education, [since] [i]t only artificially induces the exaltation attached to the completion of the greatest endeavors ... like discovery of the truth.\" Students no longer seek pleasure from the pursuit of learning.\nBloom concludes in \"Students\" that because of the relationships students have with popular culture, their family, and their peers, they no longer come to university asking questions, seeking instruction, or with imagination.\n\n\n=== \"Nihilism, American Style\" ===\nBloom titles the second part of the book \"Nihilism, American Style\". He introduces in further detail the concept of \"value relativism\", mentioned previously only in the introduction. Value relativism, he says, plagues most elite institutions of higher learning. For Bloom, this dissolved into nihilism. He notices that students follow the path of least resistance when developing their values. For students, he writes, \"values are not discovered by reason, and it is fruitless to seek them, to find the truth or the good life.\" Ironically, when traveling this path without reason, Bloom writes, students still \"adopt strong poses and fanatic resolutions.\"\nBloom also criticizes his fellow philosophy professors, especially those involved in ordinary language analysis or logical positivism, for disregarding important \"humanizing\" ethical and political issues and failing to pique the interest of students. Literature professors involved in deconstructionism promote irrationalism and skepticism of standards of truth and thereby dissolve the moral imperatives which are communicated through genuine philosophy and which elevate and broaden the intellects of those who engage with these imperatives. To a great extent, Bloom's critique extends beyond the university to speak to what he characterizes as a general crisis in American society. He draws analogies between the United States and the Weimar Republic. The modern liberal philosophy, he says, enshrined in the Enlightenment thought of John Locke—that a just society could be based upon self-interest alone, coupled by the emergence of relativism in American thought—had led to this crisis. Bloom cites Friedrich Nietzsche's actions of telling \"modern man that he was free-falling in the abyss of nihilism\", and continues to espouse Nietzsche's commentary that nihilism in our contemporary democracy stems from value relativism.\nFor Bloom, this created a void in the souls of Americans, into which demagogic radicals as exemplified by 1960s student leaders could leap. (Bloom made the comparison to the Brownshirts of the Nazi Party, who once similarly filled the gap created in German society by the Weimar Republic.) In the second instance, he argued, the higher calling of philosophy and reason understood as freedom of thought, had been eclipsed by a pseudo-philosophy, or an ideology of thought. Relativism was one feature of modern American liberal philosophy that had subverted the Platonic–Socratic teaching.\n\n\n=== \"The University\" ===\nBloom contends that the failure of contemporary liberal education leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits have become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory. In \"The University\", he discusses how the environment in elite institutions has cultivated mere ambition over the search for truth. He says that proclaiming an affinity for reason does not alone define a university's worth, as the statement alone does not constitute true commitment to scholastic pursuits in the name of a greater truth. He contends that \"the mere announcement of the rule of reason does not create the conditions for the full exercise of rationality\". Universities serve as a reflection of the public and democracy at large. Because of this, they are shaped by public opinion (per Alexis de Tocqueville). Public opinion serves as the final gatekeeper and the final headsman for any movements the university may actually try to implement to advance the pursuit of critical thinking.\nBloom also explains what he believes is the dichotomy between the \"spirit of the university\" and the university itself. \"The philosophic life is not the university.\" He alludes to early philosophers, from Socrates (who he firmly believes to be \"the essence of the university\" concept) through the nineteenth century, who he claims never made use of such institutions at all. Bloom posits that maybe, after all, free thought and commitment to a greater truth need not exist within the metaphorical four walls of a university. What matters instead, he says, what is \"uniquely human\", is the \"philosophic experience\".\nBloom also notices a trend in which students notice the devaluing of free thought in universities. He writes about students at Cornell University, that \"these students discerned that their teachers did not really believe that freedom of thought was necessarily a good and useful thing, that they suspected that all this was ideology protecting the injustices of our 'system'\". Bloom asserts that American professors in the sixties \"were not aware of what they no longer believed\" and that this notion gravely endangered any capacity for progress towards free thought. Bloom insists that requiring from universities empty values like \"greater openness\", \"less rigidity\", and \"freedom from authority\" are only fashionable and do not have any substantive content. And in the face of growing civil rights conflicts, universities have a duty to instead actively pursue the task of \"opening American minds\". It is not enough, Bloom contends, for universities to \"not want trouble\". It is not enough for universities to only hold reputation paramount in the face of campus disruption, and only in name espouse free thought and truth. This \"unfortunate mixture of cowardice and moralism\" will unseat the spirit of the university. Bloom concludes by reminding readers that the love of wisdom and truth must be kept alive in universities, particularly in this moment of world history.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nThe Closing of the American Mind was published in March 1987, five years after Bloom published an essay in the National Review about the failure of universities to serve the needs of students. With the encouragement of Saul Bellow, his colleague at the University of Chicago, he expanded his thoughts into a book \"about a life, I've led\" that critically reflected on the current state of higher education in American universities. His friends and admirers imagined the work would be a modest success, as did Bloom, who recognized his publisher's modest advance to complete the project as a lack of sales confidence. Yet on the momentum of strong initial reviews, including one by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in The New York Times and an op-ed piece by syndicated conservative commentator George Will entitled \"A How-To Book for the Independent\" it became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback and remaining at number one on The New York Times Non-fiction Best Seller list for four months.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Closing of the American Mind was met with mixed reviews from scholars and the general public alike.\n\n\n=== Positive ===\n\nThe art critic Roger Kimball wrote in The New York Times that Bloom's work should not be diminished publicly simply because it is not optimistic. Instead, he writes, \"'The Closing of the American Mind' is essential reading for anyone concerned with the state of liberal education in this society. Its pathos, erudition and penetrating insight make it an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today's intellectual and moral climate.\" He concludes that,\n\nMr. Bloom paints a sobering if not, alas, entirely unfamiliar picture. ... [O]ne of the chief things to appreciate about \"The Closing of the American Mind\" is that its dominant stance is interrogative, not prescriptive. Everything problematic that the term modernity implies, all the doubts about the meaning of tradition, the legitimacy of inherited values, the point of preserving high culture—all this Mr. Bloom is perfectly cognizant of.\nMatt Feeney from The New Yorker also wrote in his article, \"Allan Bloom's Guide to College\", in 2012, that while Bloom's core arguments may have been diluted into trite conservative barbs directed at liberal educations, the essence of his argument remains true today, and his motives do too. He explains that by writing The Closing of the American Mind, \"Bloom dangles the promise of an arousing and dangerous philosophical quest, which will take the student far from his (and his friends' and parents' and other professors') settled opinions about what is good and decent.\" As for Bloom's impact on this era of politics, Feeney suggests a reframe in the way consumers perceive Bloom's work. Feeney writes,\n\nBloom's light, urgent prose makes it easy to forget how audacious this chapter is in its depth, breadth, and seriousness, and how defiant it is in its defense of liberal education. Bloom's knee-jerk opponents tend to be leftists, but these people are merely symptoms of a deeper modern distrust of liberal learning. It might be better, then, to reframe Bloom's project, from a secretly erotic quest for sublime knowledge to an existentially urgent battle for nonconformity; real weirdness in a world that wants to co-opt everything, make everything productive for and comprehensible to everyone.\nThe neoconservative writer Norman Podhoretz embraced Bloom's argument, noting that the closed-mindedness in his title refers to the paradoxical consequence of the academic \"open mind\" found in liberal political thought—namely \"the narrow and intolerant dogmatism\" that dismisses any attempt, by Plato or the Hebrew Bible for example, to provide a rational basis for moral judgments. Podhoretz continued, \"Bloom goes on to charge liberalism with vulgarizing the noble ideals of freedom and equality, and he offers brilliantly acerbic descriptions of the sexual revolution and the feminist movement, which he sees as products of this process of vulgarization.\" Bloom's work was also supported by a larger conservative movement. In 2005, Jim Sleeper wrote for The New York Times that \"nothing prepared [conservatives'] movement, or the academic and publishing worlds, for the wildfire success of [the book]. ... Conservatives championed Bloom then, of course, and they invoke him still.\"\nIn a 1989 article, Ann Clark Fehn discussed the critical reception of the book, noting that it had eclipsed other titles that year dealing with higher education (College by Ernest L. Boyer and Cultural Literacy by E. D. Hirsch), and quoting Publishers Weekly, which had described Bloom's book as a \"bestseller made by reviews\". The poet Frederick Turner described The Closing of the American Mind as, \"The most thoughtful conservative analysis of the nation's cultural sickness.\"\nThe critic Camille Paglia called The Closing of the American Mind \"the first shot in the culture wars\", writing of Bloom that she was \"confident that in the long run he will be vindicated and his critics swallowed in obscurity\".\n\n\n=== Negative ===\nIn her review, Martha Nussbaum questioned whether Bloom deserved to be considered a philosopher. The criticism of the book was continued by impassioned reviews by Benjamin Barber in Harper's; by Alexander Nehamas in the London Review of Books; and by David Rieff in The Times Literary Supplement. David Rieff called Bloom \"an academic version of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North: vengeful, reactionary, antidemocratic.\" The book, he said, was one that \"decent people would be ashamed of having written.\" The tone of these reviews led James Atlas in The New York Times Magazine to conclude \"the responses to Bloom's book have been charged with a hostility that transcends the usual mean-spiritedness of reviewers.\"\nWilliam Greider wrote for Rolling Stone that there were two main reasons for the roaring commercial success of Bloom's work. The first, he says, is purely due to the \"impassioned quality of Bloom's prose. The professor's rhetoric is laced with high-blown discourses on his great-books heroes and his enemies list ... The average reader is undoubtedly flattered by Bloom's intellectual name-dropping; it's always fun to be high-minded about someone else's ignorance.\" According to Greider, the second reason behind Bloom's success is timing. He writes that \"the book's appearance coincides with a surge of national concern about the disappearance of traditional education. Another current best seller, Cultural Literacy, by E.D. Hirsch Jr., also taps the same anxieties.\" Ultimately, Greider concludes that Bloom's agenda is simply a vicious attack on the values of young America. He writes,\n\nBloom's real agenda is much darker—to launch a nasty, reactionary attack on the values of young people and everyone else under forty. His multi-count indictment is a laundry list of cheap slanders made to sound vaguely authoritative, because, after all, Bloom is a teacher who supposedly hangs out with students. In fact, Bloom sounds bewildered by young people—and strangely out of touch with them.\nFor Greider, it is unfathomable how Bloom could revile the decline in prejudice and relegate that decline to a lack of imagination. He concludes, \"Bloom apparently detests the young.\"\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nThe jurist Richard Posner compared Bloom's book to Paglia's Sexual Personae (1990), finding both books to be examples of \"difficult academic works that mysteriously strike a chord with a broad public.\" Thus, since publication, The Closing of the American Mind fueled many impassioned debates about the state of culture in America. In retaliation the American historian Lawrence W. Levine wrote The Opening of the American Mind. According to The New York Times' Edward Rothstein, Levine's work, published ten full years later, still found it relevant to \"praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised.\" But where, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed them, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, \"many conservatives have no problem with diversity if it is accompanied by rigor; many liberals have no problem with rigor if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoming increasingly widespread.\" Ultimately, Rothstein concludes, Bloom's work has very little to do \"with current political demarcations.\"\nConversely, Jerry Aaron Snyder of The New Republic argues that the culture wars, which Bloom's work clearly helped spark a conversation about, will consistently be relevant. While it may be argued that The Closing of the American Mind may not resign itself to a political party, this does not preclude it from the impact it had on the culture wars, and how those culture wars shape life today. Snyder argues that books like Bloom's have inspired further conversations and controversies alike, such as controversy surrounding how history is taught in high schools, or the effectiveness of affirmative action or identity politics. According to Snyder, the discussions spawned by the initial culture wars in the 1980s because of books like Bloom's, \"'the soul of America' is a bottomless well. For better or worse, it will never run dry.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Coddling of the American Mind (2018) – another bestseller with related title\nThe Bell Curve (1994) – another bestseller with controversial reception primarily in conservative circles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Quotations related to The Closing of the American Mind at Wikiquote\nThe Closing of the American Mind: A Summary",

    "full_narrative": "How to Read a Book is a book by the American philosopher Mortimer J. Adler. Originally published in 1940, it was heavily revised for a 1972 edition, co-authored by Adler with editor Charles Van Doren. The 1972 revision gives guidelines for critically reading good and great books of any tradition. In addition, it deals with genres (including, but not limited to, poetry, history, science, and fiction), as well as inspectional and syntopical reading.\n\n\n== Overview of the 1972 edition ==\nHow to Read a Book is divided into four parts, each consisting of several chapters.\n\n\n=== Part 1: The Dimensions of Reading ===\nHere, Adler sets forth his method for reading a non-fiction book in order to gain understanding. He claims that three distinct approaches, or readings, must all be made in order to get the most possible out of a book, but that performing these three levels of readings does not necessarily mean reading the book three times, as the experienced reader will be able to do all three in the course of reading the book just once. Adler names the readings \"structural\", \"interpretative\", and \"critical\", in that order.\nStructural stage: The first stage of analytical reading is concerned with understanding the structure and purpose of the book. It begins with determining the basic topic and type of the book being read, so as to better anticipate the contents and comprehend the book from the very beginning. Adler says that the reader must distinguish between practical and theoretical books, as well as determining the field of study that the book addresses. Further, Adler says that the reader must note any divisions in the book, and that these are not restricted to the divisions laid out in the table of contents. Lastly, the reader must find out what problems the author is trying to solve.\nInterpretive stage: The second stage of analytical reading involves constructing the author's arguments. This first requires the reader to note and understand any special phrases and terms that the author uses. Once that is done, Adler says that the reader should find and work to understand each proposition that the author advances, as well as the author's support for those propositions.\nCritical stage: In the third stage of analytical reading, Adler directs the reader to critique the book. He asserts that upon understanding the author's propositions and arguments, the reader has been elevated to the author's level of understanding and is now able (and obligated) to judge the book's merit and accuracy. Adler advocates judging books based on the soundness of their arguments. Adler says that one may not disagree with an argument unless one can find fault in its reasoning, facts, or premises, though one is free to dislike it in any case.\n\n\n=== Part 2: The Third Level of Reading: Analytical Reading ===\nAdler explains for whom the book is intended, defines different classes of reading, and tells which classes will be addressed. He also makes a brief argument favoring the Great Books, and explains his reasons for writing How to Read a Book.\nThere are three types of knowledge: practical, informational, and comprehensive. He discusses the methods of acquiring knowledge, concluding that 1. practical knowledge, though teachable, cannot be truly mastered without experience, 2. that only informational knowledge can be gained by one whose understanding equals the author's, and 3. that comprehension (insight) is best learned from the person who first achieved said understanding – an \"original communication\" with the source of understanding.\nThe idea that communication directly from those who first discovered an idea is the best way of gaining understanding is Adler's argument for reading the Great Books; that any book that does not represent original communication is inferior, as a source, to the original, and that any teacher, save those who discovered the subject he or she teaches, is inferior to the Great Books as a source of comprehension.\nAdler spends a good deal of this first section explaining why he was compelled to write this book. He asserts that very few people can read a book for understanding, but that he believes that most are capable of it, given the right instruction and the will to do so. It is his intent to provide that instruction. He takes time to tell the reader about how he believes that the educational system has failed to teach students the art of reading well, up to and including undergraduate, university-level institutions. He concludes that, due to these shortcomings in formal education, it falls upon individuals to cultivate these abilities in themselves. Throughout this section, he relates anecdotes and summaries of his experience in education as support for these assertions.\n\n\n=== Part 3: Approaches to Different Kinds of Reading Matter ===\nIn this part, Adler briefly discusses the differences in approaching various kinds of literature and suggests reading several other books. He explains a method of approaching the Great Books – read the books that influenced a given author prior to reading works by that author – and gives several examples of that method.\n\n\n=== Part 4: The Ultimate Goals of Reading ===\nThe last part of the book covers the fourth level of reading: syntopical reading. At this stage, the reader broadens and deepens his or her knowledge on a given subject – e.g., love, war, particle physics, etc. – by reading several books on that subject. In the final pages of this part, the author expounds on the philosophical benefits of reading: \"growth of the mind\", fuller experience as a conscious being...\n\n\n== Reading list (1972 edition) ==\n\nAppendix A in the 1972 edition provided the following recommended reading list:\n\n\n== Publication data ==\nMortimer Adler (1940), How to Read a Book: The Art of Getting a Liberal Education (registration required), OCLC 822771595\nĐọc sách online (registration required) published with subtitle A Guide to Reading the Great Books, ISBN 978-0-671-21209-4.

    "full_narrative": "Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis is a 2016 memoir by JD Vance about the Appalachian values of his family from Kentucky and the socioeconomic problems of his hometown of Middletown, Ohio, where his mother's parents moved when they were young. It was adapted into the 2020 film Hillbilly Elegy, directed by Ron Howard and starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams.\nLater, Vance progressed in public service, becoming a senator from Ohio in 2023 and the vice president of the United States in 2025.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\nVance describes his upbringing and family background while growing up in Middletown, Ohio, where his mother and her family had moved after World War II from Breathitt County, Kentucky. \nVance states that their Appalachian culture valued traits such as loyalty and love of country despite family violence and verbal abuse. Vance recounts his grandparents' alcoholism as well as his mother's history of drug addictions and failed relationships. Vance's grandparents reconciled and became his guardians. His strict but loving grandmother pushed Vance, who went on to complete undergraduate studies at Ohio State University and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Yale Law School.\nVance raises questions about the responsibility of his family and local people for their misfortunes. Vance suggests that hillbilly culture fosters social disintegration and economic insecurity in Appalachia. He cites a personal experience where, while working as a grocery store cashier, he saw welfare recipients with cell phones when he could not afford one.\nVance's antipathy toward those who seemed to profit from poor behavior while he struggled is presented as a rationale for Appalachia's political swing from voting Democratic to a strong Republican affiliation. Vance tells stories highlighting the lack of work ethic of the local people, including the story of a man who quit his job after expressing dislike over his work hours, and a co-worker with a pregnant girlfriend who skipped work unexcused.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nIn July 2016, Hillbilly Elegy was popularized by an interview with Vance in The American Conservative. The volume of requests briefly disabled the website. Halfway through August, The New York Times wrote that the title had remained in the top ten Amazon bestsellers since the interview's publication.\nVance has credited his Yale contract law professor Amy Chua as the \"authorial godmother\" of the book, as she persuaded him to write the memoir.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe book reached the top of The New York Times best seller list in August 2016 and January 2017.\n\nIn a positive review in The New York Times, Jennifer Senior wrote that Vance's confrontation of a social taboo was admirable, regardless of whether the reader agreed with his conclusions. She described the book as \"a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump.\" Senior wrote that Vance's subject is despair, and his argument was more generous in that it blames fatalism and learned helplessness rather than indolence.\nA 2017 Brookings Institution report noted that \"J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy became a national bestseller for its raw, emotional portrait of growing up in and eventually out of a poor rural community riddled by drug addiction and instability.\" Vance's account anecdotally confirmed the report's conclusion that family stability is essential to upward mobility.\nIn an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung in July 2023, German chancellor Olaf Scholz called the book \"a very touching personal story of how a young man with poor starting conditions makes his way.\" Scholz said the book had moved him to tears, but that he found the positions Vance later took to be \"tragic.\"\nThe book was positively received by conservatives such as National Review columnist Mona Charen and National Review editor and Slate columnist Reihan Salam. American Conservative contributor and blogger Rod Dreher expressed admiration for Hillbilly Elegy, saying that Vance \"draws conclusions... that may be hard for some people to take. Vance has earned the right to make those judgments. This was his life. He speaks with authority that has been extremely hard won.\" The following month, Dreher posted about his theories about why liberals loved the book. New York Post columnist and editor of Commentary John Podhoretz described the book as among the year's most provocative.\nHowever, other journalists criticized Vance for generalizing too much from his personal upbringing in suburban Ohio. Jared Yates Sexton of Salon criticized Vance for his \"damaging rhetoric\" and for endorsing policies used to \"gut the poor\". He argues that Vance \"totally discounts the role racism played in the white working class's opposition to President Obama.\" Sarah Jones of The New Republic mocked Vance as \"the false prophet of Blue America,\" dismissing him as \"a flawed guide to this world\" and the book as little more than \"a list of myths about welfare queens repackaged as a primer on the white working class.\"\nHistorian Bob Hutton wrote in Jacobin that Vance's argument relied on circular logic and eugenics, ignored existing scholarship on Appalachian poverty, and was \"primarily a work of self-congratulation.\" Sarah Smarsh with The Guardian noted that \"most downtrodden whites are not conservative male Protestants from Appalachia\" and called into question Vance's generalizations about the white working class from his personal upbringing.\nThe book provoked a response in the form of an anthology, Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to Hillbilly Elegy, edited by Anthony Harkins and Meredith McCarroll. The essays in the volume criticize Vance for making broad generalizations and reproducing myths about poverty.\nThe book was discussed in an episode of the podcast If Books Could Kill.\n\n\n=== Relationship to Donald Trump ===\nA key reason for Hillbilly Elegy's widespread popularity following its publication in 2016 was its role in explaining Donald Trump's rise to the top of the Republican Party. \nIn particular, it purportedly explains why white, working-class voters became attracted to Trump as a political leader. Vance himself offered commentary on how his book provides perspective on why a voter from the \"hillbilly\" demographic would support Trump.\nAlthough he does not mention Trump in the book, Vance openly criticized the then presidential candidate while discussing his memoir in a 2016 interview following the book's release. Vance walked these comments back when he joined the 2022 U.S. Senate race in Ohio, and later openly endorsed Trump. In July 2024, Vance was picked by Trump to be his running mate on the Republican ticket for the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\n=== Renewed attention ===\nAfter Vance was announced as Trump's running mate in 2024, sales of the book and viewership for the film on Netflix increased dramatically.\nOn July 15, 2024, an Internet hoax spread from social network Twitter falsely claiming that Hillbilly Elegy described Vance having sexual intercourse with a couch. Internet memes were generated in response, and the viral hoax's spread was amplified after the Associated Press published and promptly deleted a fact-check of it.\n\n\n== Sequel ==\nIn 2017, Vance signed an $8 million deal to write a sequel to Hillbilly Elegy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPolitical positions of JD Vance\nUnhumans\nDawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nC-SPAN Q&A interview with Vance on Hillbilly Elegy, October 23, 2016",

    "full_narrative": "Know My Name: A Memoir is a 2019 memoir by American author Chanel Miller. In it, Miller writes about her experience being sexually assaulted by then Stanford University athlete Brock Turner in January 2015, as well as the aftermath and subsequent court case People v. Turner.\n\n\n== Research and writing process ==\nIn September 2019, Chanel Miller revealed herself as being \"Emily Doe\" in the People v. Turner case and released her book with the title, Know My Name: A Memoir, on September 24, 2019. She first began work on the book in 2017. The book was an attempt by Miller to reappropriate her narrative identity and describe the trauma she went through, after being referred to in the press as \"unconscious intoxicated woman\". The author discusses her experience of the assault and the trial, as well as how she has coped since then. Through research for the work, Miller perused court transcripts and testimonies of individuals involved in the court proceedings—materials she had been unable to view throughout the trial of Brock Turner itself.\n\n\n== Cover art ==\nThe cover art for the book was inspired by kintsugi, which is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with powdered gold, emphasizing the cracks rather than covering them up.\n\n\n== Publication and sales ==\nThe book was initially published by Viking Books, through efforts by the publisher's editor-in-chief Andrea Schulz. Schulz took quick action after being contacted by Miller's literary agent, Philippa Brophy. Schulz worked to acquire the rights to the book because of Miller's writing skill and her compelling account. The same month as the book's publication, Miller was interviewed on CBS News program 60 Minutes, where she read from her original victim impact statement.\nKnow My Name debuted on The New York Times Best Seller list at number five, and also made number 14 on the USA Today Best-Selling Books list. The work additionally made the list of Best-Selling Books in The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting for The Guardian, Rebecca Liu wrote that Know My Name was \"unapologetically large\", calling Miller's presence \"dazzling\" and undiminishable. Madison Feller of Elle magazine called it \"both an open wound and a salve, a quiet cry and the loudest scream\".\nU.S. Congresswoman Jackie Speier, who coordinated the June 2016 movement in Congress to openly read the text of Miller's victim statement into the United States House of Representatives, called the book \"a powerful example of how we can overcome adversity\". Stanford law professor Michele Dauber commented \"When people read her book, they will be impressed with her. They will be convinced that Judge Persky and Stanford University behaved very badly.\" After Miller made the decision to go public with her real name, Stanford University released a statement: \"We applaud Ms. Miller's bravery in talking publicly about the ordeal she has experienced and the horrible act that she suffered on our campus. As a university, we are continuing our efforts to prevent and respond effectively to sexual violence, with the ultimate goal of eradicating it from our community.\"\nThe book was named one of the top ten books of 2019 by the Washington Post, as well as a top ten book for the American Library Association's Rise: A Feminist Book Project in 2021. It was nominated for Best Memoir & Autobiography at the 2019 Goodreads Choice Awards, and was the winner of the 2019 National Book Critics Circle Award (Autobiography). The San Francisco Public Library selected the book for their 2021 One City One Book program.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMagnolia Wu Unfolds It All\n\n\n== References ==",

    "full_narrative": "Crying in H Mart: A Memoir is a 2021 memoir by Michelle Zauner, singer and guitarist of the band Japanese Breakfast. It is her debut book, published on April 20, 2021, by Alfred A. Knopf. It is an expansion of Zauner's essay of the same name which was published in The New Yorker on August 20, 2018. The title mentions H Mart, a North American supermarket chain that specializes in Korean and other Asian products.\nThe memoir received critical acclaim and became a major bestseller.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter Zauner's mother Chongmi died of pancreatic cancer in October 2014, Zauner frequently made trips to H Mart, an experience she chronicled in her New Yorker essay and in \"Real Life: Love, Loss and Kimchi\" which won Glamour Magazine's 11th essay contest.\nZauner has said that she decided to write a book-length memoir after literary agents contacted her following the publication of her New Yorker essay. In February 2019, American publishing house Alfred A. Knopf announced that it had won the rights to the book at auction.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book begins with the titular essay in which Zauner talks about buying ingredients for Korean cuisine at H Mart. Zauner reminisces about her mother, Chongmi, calling her strict but loving. Zauner writes that she wanted more family approval yet frequently disobeyed her parents and was considered rebellious.\nEvery two years, Zauner and Chongmi travel to Seoul to visit their family. When Zauner is 14, her maternal grandmother dies, leaving Zauner haunted by her last words.\nDuring high school, Zauner falls into depression, resulting in truancy. Chongmi allows her to sleep once a week at her best friend's house, where she begins to admire her friend's mother, engendering Chongmi's jealousy and straining their relationship. Zauner is inspired to learn guitar after watching a DVD of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Karen O, who is also of Korean American heritage. Zauner begins to write songs and perform in public, including opening for Maria Taylor at the W.O.W. Hall. Zauner applies to liberal arts universities for women and attends Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, to Chongmi's disappointment.\nIn 2014, Zauner graduates from college with a creative writing degree and leads a band named Little Big League. However, the band struggles to find commercial success. That summer, Zauner learns that Chongmi has cancer and flies to Eugene to care for her. Soon after Chongmi returns home, her friend Kye arrives and begins to take care of her.\nIn August, Zauner returns to Philadelphia to tour with Little Big League. After the tour, her father Joel reveals that Chongmi's condition is worsening. The three fly to Seoul as per Chongmi's wishes but she is hospitalized upon arrival. After Chongmi recovers, Zauner and Joel transfer her to Riverbend Hospital in Eugene.\nWanting her mother to attend her wedding, Zauner proposes marriage to her boyfriend Peter, who accepts. Soon after, Zauner and Peter get married with their families and friends attending. After the wedding, Kye leaves after being irritated by Joel. Soon after, Chongmi's condition declines drastically and she dies on October 18, 2014. Joel, Zauner, and Peter host a funeral the next week. Joel and Zauner fly to Vietnam, hoping to soothe their grief but the trip only strains their relationship.\nAfter moving to Brooklyn with Peter, Zauner begins learning to cook Korean cuisine and records music to cope with her grief. She begins working at an advertising firm in New York City, deciding that she will soon quit recording music due to her lack of success.\nZauner submits an album to Yellow K Records as Japanese Breakfast, titling it Psychopomp. Its reception exceeds Zauner's expectations and Japanese Breakfast signs with the record label Dead Oceans. The band tours to promote the album and Zauner quits her advertising job.\nDuring the band's last tour date in Asia, Zauner's maternal aunt Nami and her husband, whom Zauner nicknamed \"Boo\", are in attendance. After the concert ends, Zauner and Peter spend time with Nami and Boo. On the night before they depart, Zauner and Peter accompany Nami and Boo to a karaoke bar where Nami asks Zauner to sing \"Coffee Hanjan\". As the lyrics begin, Zauner hopes that her heritage will help her sing the words.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Sales ===\nCrying in H Mart debuted as the seventh-best-selling hardcover nonfiction book for the week ending April 24, 2021, according to Publishers Weekly and The Wall Street Journal, which use data from NPD BookScan. \nIt debuted at number two on The New York Times best-seller list for combined print and e-book nonfiction for the week ending April 24, 2021, and ultimately spent 55 weeks on the list. It also spent 67 weeks on the Times'  hardcover nonfiction best-seller list. \nA paperback edition was published by Vintage Books on March 28, 2023. The book topped the Times's paperback nonfiction category for the week ending April 8, 2023, and remained on the list for 43 weeks.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nPublishers Weekly wrote, \"The prose is lyrical if at times overwrought, but Zauner does a good job capturing the grief of losing a parent with pathos.\"\nKristen Martin of NPR called the book a \"rare acknowledgement of the ravages of cancer in a culture obsessed with seeing it as an enemy that can be battled with hope and strength.\"\nIn The Atlantic, food writer Mayukh Sen wrote, \"As lovely as Zauner's indulgent sketches of meals are, they slow her momentum...But agile writers know how to mine food for emotional truth, and Zauner finds her footing as Crying in H Mart progresses. Near the end, she connects food to her own unmooring.\"\nIn a starred review, Kirkus Reviews called the memoir \"a tender, well-rendered, heart-wrenching account of the way food ties us to those who have passed.\"\nThe book received the 2021 Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir & Autobiography. It was also named a top book of the year by numerous publications, including Time, The Atlantic and Entertainment Weekly. In September 2022, Zauner was announced as one of the winners of the 43rd annual American Book Awards.\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nOn June 7, 2021, it was announced that Crying in H Mart: A Memoir would be adapted as a feature film by Orion Pictures. Zauner will adapt the film and provide the film's soundtrack, as Japanese Breakfast. In May 2022, Zauner announced that she had finished the first draft of the screenplay.\nWill Sharpe was announced as the director of the film adaptation in March 2023.\nIn January 2025, Zauner announced that the film was \"on pause\". She explained: \"There were issues with the Hollywood strikes, and the director stepped away from the project. I spent a year working on the screenplay, which was a tough but rewarding process. I still have faith it will get made someday, but it's not happening anytime soon. Right now, I'm focusing on other creative projects, so the film will have to wait.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

    "full_narrative": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty is a 2021 book by Patrick Radden Keefe. The book examines the history of the Sackler family, including the founding of Purdue Pharma, its role in the marketing of pharmaceuticals, and the family's central role in the opioid epidemic. The book followed Keefe's 2017 article on the Sackler family in The New Yorker, titled \"The Family That Built an Empire of Pain\".\n\n\n== Summary ==\nArthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler were children of Jewish immigrants that were raised in Brooklyn. All three brothers became medical doctors, but the eldest, Arthur, showed a particular talent for advertising, combining both his passions by joining and later owning William Douglas McAdams Inc., an advertising firm that exclusively handled medicinal clients and pioneered the technique of advertising medication directly to doctors. Despite having many conflicts of interest, Arthur was able to keep these associations hidden by leaving his brothers, friends, and ex-wife as figureheads for various companies. As Arthur continued to amass his fortune, he and his younger brothers begin to make important philanthropic contributions, donating money to museums and for scholarships. The brothers eventually grew estranged; when Arthur died in 1987, his complicated legacy was left to multiple heirs including his brothers, his wife, his ex-wife, and his four children. When the fight to split the assets devolved into acrimony, his children agreed to sell their shares in Purdue Frederick, a small drug manufacturer, to their uncles Mortimer and Raymond.\nMortimer and Raymond Sackler invested in research into opioids with their investment in research eventually leading to Oxycodone. After Mortimer and Raymond joined the board at Purdue Frederick, the family began to roll out a sales force to sell Oxycodone using techniques pioneered by Arthur in order to influence politicians, government officials and doctors into endorsing the pill. Their new drug was an immediate success, but almost equally quickly, users began to abuse the drug. In 2010, the company discontinued their initial version of the drug and made a version that was impossible to crush; this led to a 25% drop in sales and a rise in heroin which was arguably caused by opioid abuse. As lawsuits began to build against Purdue Frederick, the Sackler family sought to insulate themselves both financially and publicly from the drug. All Sacklers declined interviews and the Sacklers on the board of the company repeatedly voted to give themselves huge financial bonuses.\nBy 2017, a series of articles linking the Sacklers to Oxycodone as well as a public campaign by photographer Nan Goldin to link the Sacklers to the opioid crisis, led to stigmatization of the Sackler name with many museums and universities refusing financial gifts from the Sacklers.\nWhile the family was eventually sued, the Sacklers used their company to declare bankruptcy, link their personal finances to the fortunes of Purdue Frederick, and ultimately managed to escape any financial consequences at all. The family continued to maintain that they knew nothing about the abusive and deceptive marketing practices of the company and maintained the lie that their opioids were not addictive and that the few people who abused their drugs were already addicts to begin with.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nNew York noted that Empire of Pain differs from other coverage of the Sackler's role in the opioid crisis, calling the book \"principally a family history\". Zachary Siegel, writing in The New Republic, called the book an \"important record of private greed facilitated by a corrupted government\". Publishers Weekly called the book a \"damning review\" of the family's involvement in the opioid epidemic. Joanna Walter praised Patrick Radden Keefe's telling of the decade-spanning story in Literary Review: \"He expertly draws all the threads together to bring us the full, frightening saga... the sum of its parts is a stunning crime story.\"\nThe book won the 2021 Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-fiction and the Goodreads Choice Award for History & Biography, was shortlisted for the 2021 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award, and was longlisted for the 2022 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction. It was also selected for The Washington Post's \"10 Best Books of 2021\" list.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "full_narrative": "Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland is a 2018 book by writer and journalist Patrick Radden Keefe. It focuses on the Troubles in Northern Ireland. It spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list and received widespread critical acclaim. It was adapted into a 2024 limited series for Hulu and Disney+.  \n\n\n== Summary ==\nSay Nothing's subject is The Troubles in Northern Ireland, with the 1972 abduction and murder of Jean McConville as a central focus. The book describes the lives of Dolours Price, Marian Price, Brendan Hughes, Gerry Adams, and Jean McConville's children. Through these figures, it offers a history of the Troubles as a whole: the civil rights movement and the turn to violence at the end of the 1960s, the Provisional IRA's bombing campaign, the 1981 hunger strike, the peace process and the opposition it faced within the republican movement, and the post-conflict struggle to understand crimes like McConville's murder. The book also details the efforts of the Belfast Project to research and investigate the events of the conflict, which was led by Anthony McIntyre, Ed Moloney, and Robert Keating O'Neill at Boston College. Keefe began researching and writing the book after reading an obituary of Dolours Price in 2013.\n\n\n== Title ==\nThe book's title is taken from the poem \"Whatever You Say, Say Nothing\" by Irish Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney from his collection North (1975).\n\n\n== Publication ==\nSay Nothing was first published by the William Collins imprint of HarperCollins on 1 November 2018. It was later published in the US by Doubleday on 26 February 2019.\nThe book debuted at number five on The New York Times Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction best-sellers list on 17 March 2019. It spent six weeks on the list. Say Nothing also debuted at number seven on The New York Times Hardcover Nonfiction best-sellers list on 17 March 2019, and spent six weeks on the list.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nJennifer Szalai of The New York Times wrote, \"Keefe's narrative is an architectural feat, expertly constructed out of complex and contentious material, arranged and balanced just so.\"\nMaureen Corrigan of NPR enthusiastically wrote, \"Keefe is a storyteller who captures the complexities of a historical moment by digging deep into the lives of people on all sides of the conflict.\" Corrigan concludes, \"At the end of his panoramic book, which gathers together history, politics and biography, Keefe tightens the focus back to the mystery of McConville's abduction and murder. And, as in the most ingenious crime stories, Keefe unveils a revelation — lying, so to speak, in plain sight — that only further complicates the moral dimensions of his tale.\"\nDevlin Barrett of The Washington Post described how Say Nothing is \"a cautionary tale, [that] speaks volumes — about the zealotry of youth, the long-term consequences of violence and the politics of forgetting.\"\nThe Economist noted, \"The discerning skill with which Mr. Radden Keefe gets inside these characters' minds may unsettle some readers, but it is also his book's strength. He shows how people who in peacetime might just have been strong-willed or colourful types came to condone or perpetrate the unspeakable.\"\nStephen Phillips of the Los Angeles Times praised the book saying, \"Say Nothing powerfully documents a society benumbed by trauma attempting to reckon with the abyss that engulfed it.\"\nIn May 2019, Irish journalist Ed Moloney, who was the director of the Belfast Project, published a piece in CounterPunch in which he alleged several inaccuracies in Keefe's book. He also criticised Keefe's decision to cite the book using endnotes, which a publishing industry source told Moloney \"convey a more commercial narrative\", instead of using Chicago Manual of Style footnotes. With Keefe not using footnotes, Moloney says: \"The writing thus flows uninterrupted, appearing to the untutored reader – or reviewer – as being the work of the author when it may not be. It takes hard work and determination to discover how much of this book is truly original reporting and how much is taken from other people's work. A 'more commercial narrative' indeed.\"\n\n\n=== Awards and honors ===\nThe book was named one of the top ten books of 2019 by both The New York Times Book Review and The Washington Post. It won the 2019 National Book Critics Circle Award for nonfiction. In 2024, it was listed #19 on The New York Times' 100 Best Books of the 21st Century list.\n\n\n== Television adaptation ==\n\nIn February 2024, FX announced that they would be adapting the book into a limited series. The series premiered on 14 November 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a history of the American inventors and aviation pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright. The book was on The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers list for seven weeks in 2015.\n\n\n== Production ==\nMcCullough first became interested in writing a book on the Wright brothers while researching for his book The Greater Journey, which explored the history of various notable Americans who lived in Paris during the 19th century.  In an interview with The Seattle Times, McCullough recalled, \"I didn't know when (chronologically) I was going to end that book, and who do I run into in France but the Wright brothers.\"  He continued, \"I was delighted to find that Wilbur, at every chance, went to the Louvre to look at paintings, and the degree that he was moved by the great Gothic works of France was far beyond that of an ordinary tourist.  [...]  Much of what has been written about the Wright brothers (in French) has been ignored. That's what pulled me into doing the book.\"\nMcCullough has had a lifelong interest in aviation.  In an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent, he remarked, \"I loved to make model airplanes when I was a young boy and I took flying lessons later on; I would have continued if they weren’t so expensive. But I have to say in all candor that I knew very little about [the Wright brothers]. I knew they were from Ohio, I knew they were bicycles mechanics, and I knew they invented the airplane. But I really didn’t know anything beyond that of any substance...\"  He added, \"Once I got into their lives and into all that they went through and the truly admirable human qualities that they personified, I would have wanted to write the book even if they hadn't succeeded in inventing the flying machine.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Wright Brothers has been praised by literary critics and historians.  Janet Maslin of The New York Times described it as a \"concise, exciting and fact-packed book [that] sees the easy segue between bicycling and aerial locomotion, which at that point was mostly a topic for bird fanciers and dreamers.\"  She added, \"Mr. McCullough presents all this with dignified panache, and with detail so granular you may wonder how it was all collected.\" In The New York Review of Books, the novelist James Salter wrote, \"Having twice won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for his best-selling histories and biographies, McCullough is a much-loved dean of Americana, and his new book, a dual biography, has a warm appeal.\" Writing in The Washington Post, Reeve Lindbergh, daughter of the famed aviator Charles Lindbergh, called The Wright Brothers a \"superb new book\" and wrote, \"McCullough's magical account of their early adventures — enhanced by volumes of family correspondence, written records, and his own deep understanding of the country and the era — shows as never before how two Ohio boys from a remarkable family taught the world to fly.\" Bruce Watson of the San Francisco Chronicle observed, \"The Wright Brothers will do more than help Americans tell Orville from Wilbur. Fighting the persistent myth of invention's 'aha' moment, McCullough shows the importance of experiment, error and inspiration in nature. Although they studied early gliders, Orville and Wilbur also watched birds. 'Learning the secret of flight from a bird,' Orville said, 'is a good deal like learning the secret of magic from a magician.' Likewise, to learn history from a master storyteller is to relive the past.\"\nBob Hoover of the Star Tribune was slightly more critical of the work, remarking, \"Although this new biography, The Wright Brothers, refreshes their often-told story in McCullough's upbeat, minutely researched manner, something's lacking — interesting characters. While the brothers accomplished their goal of powered flight, they missed out on the stuff that makes life interesting — relationships, children, hobbies, fun and, most of all, self-reflection.\"  He concluded, \"Despite their old-fashioned manners and plain style, the Wright brothers were reticent and difficult people, traits that McCullough seemed unwilling to explore in his search for the virtues and strengths he values so much in American life.\" Buzzy Jackson of The Boston Globe similarly described it as \"a tidy and relatively short history\" of the Wright brothers and praised the author's attention to detail, despite noting, \"While there is much to like here, McCullough's gee-whiz attitude toward America's favorite flying Boy Scouts does feel a bit retro.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nC-SPAN Q&A interview with McCullough on The Wright Brothers, May 31, 2015",

It also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKatherine Goble works at the West Area of Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in 1961, alongside her colleagues Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan, as lowly \"computers\", performing mathematical calculations without being told what they are for. All of them are African-American women; the unit is segregated by race and sex. White supervisor Vivian Mitchell assigns Katherine to assist Al Harrison's Space Task Group, given her skills in analytic geometry. She becomes the first Black woman on the team; head engineer Paul Stafford is especially dismissive.\nMary is assigned to the space capsule heat shield team, where she immediately identifies a design flaw. Encouraged by her team leader, Karl Zielinski, a Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivor, Mary applies for a NASA engineer position. She is told by Mitchell that, regardless of her degree in mathematics and physical science, the position requires additional courses. Mary files a petition for permission to attend all-white Hampton High School, despite her husband's opposition. Pleading her case in court, she wins over the local judge by appealing to his sense of history, allowing her to attend night classes.\nKatherine meets African-American National Guard Lt. Col. Jim Johnson, who voices skepticism about women's mathematical abilities. He later apologizes and begins to spend time with Katherine and her three daughters. The Mercury 7 astronauts visit Langley, and astronaut John Glenn goes out of his way to greet the West Area women. Katherine impresses Harrison by solving a complex mathematical equation from redacted documents, as the Soviet Union's successful launch of Yuri Gagarin increases pressure to send American astronauts into space.\nHarrison confronts Katherine about her \"breaks,\" unaware that she is forced to walk half a mile (800 meters) to use the nearest restroom designated for \"colored\" people. She angrily explains the discrimination she faces at work, which leads Harrison to destroy the \"colored\" restroom signs and abolish restroom segregation. He allows Katherine to be included in high-level meetings to calculate the space capsule's re-entry point. Stafford instructs Katherine to remove her name from the reports, insisting that \"computers\" cannot be credited as authors, and her work is credited solely to Stafford.\nInformed by Mitchell that there are no plans to assign a \"permanent supervisor for the colored group,\" Dorothy learns that NASA has installed an IBM 7090 electronic computer, which threatens to replace human computers. When a librarian scolds her for visiting the whites-only section, Dorothy sneaks out a book about Fortran and teaches herself and her West Area co-workers programming. She visits the computer room, successfully starts the machine, and is promoted to supervise the Programming Department; she agrees to do so if thirty of her co-workers are transferred as well. Mitchell finally addresses her as \"Mrs. Vaughan\".\nMaking final arrangements for John Glenn's launch, the department no longer needs human computers; Katherine is reassigned to the West Area and marries Jim. On the day of the launch, discrepancies are found in the IBM 7090 calculations, and Katherine is asked to check the capsule's landing coordinates. She delivers the results to the control room, and Harrison allows her inside. After a successful launch and orbit, a warning indicates the capsule's heat shield may be loose. Mission Control decides to land Glenn after three orbits instead of seven, and Katherine supports Harrison's suggestion to leave the retro-rocket attached to help keep the heat shield in place. Friendship 7 lands successfully.\nAn epilogue notes that Mary obtained her degree and became NASA's first female African American engineer; Dorothy continued on as NASA's first African American supervisor; and Katherine, whom Stafford accepted as a coauthor, performed calculations for the Apollo 11 and Space Shuttle missions. The epilogue also mentions that Katherine was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, and NASA dedicated the Langley Research Center's Katherine Johnson Computational Building in her honor the following year.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development and casting ===\nIn 2015, producer Donna Gigliotti acquired Margot Lee Shetterly's nonfiction book Hidden Figures, about a group of Black female mathematicians that helped NASA win the Space Race. Allison Schroeder wrote the script, which was developed by Gigliotti through Levantine Films. Schroeder grew up by Cape Canaveral and her grandparents worked at NASA, where she also interned as a teenager, and as a result saw the project as a perfect fit for herself. Levantine Films produced the film with Peter Chernin's Chernin Entertainment. Fox 2000 Pictures acquired the film rights, and Theodore Melfi signed on to direct. After coming aboard, Melfi revised Schroeder's script, and in particular focused on balancing the home lives of the three protagonists with their careers at NASA. After the film's development was announced, actresses considered to play the lead roles included Oprah Winfrey, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, and Taraji P. Henson.\nChernin and Jenno Topping produced, along with Gigliotti and Melfi. Fox cast Henson to play the lead role of mathematician Katherine Goble Johnson. Spencer was selected to play Dorothy Vaughan, one of the three lead mathematicians at NASA. Kevin Costner was cast in the film to play the fictional head of the space program. Singer Janelle Monáe signed on to play the third lead mathematician, Mary Jackson. Kirsten Dunst, Glen Powell, and Mahershala Ali were cast in the film: Powell to play astronaut John Glenn, and Ali as Johnson's love interest.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began in March 2016 on the campus of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. Scenes were also shot on location in Historic Downtown Canton, Georgia. Filming also took place at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. Jim Parsons was cast in the film to play the head engineer of the Space Task Group at NASA, Paul Stafford. Pharrell Williams (a native of Virginia Beach, near Langley Research Center) came on board as a producer on the film. He also wrote original songs and handled the music department and soundtrack of the film, with Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. Morehouse College mathematics professor Rudy L. Horne was brought in to be the on-set mathematician.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\nThe film, set at NASA Langley Research Center in 1961, depicts segregated facilities such as the West Area Computing unit, where an all-Black group of female mathematicians were originally required to use separate dining and bathroom facilities. However, in reality, Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to supervisor of West Computing much earlier, in 1949, becoming the first Black supervisor at the  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and one of its few female supervisors. In 1958, when NACA became NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished. Vaughan and many of the former West computers transferred to the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group.\nIt was Mary Jackson, not Katherine Goble Johnson, who had difficulty finding a colored bathroom – in a 1953 incident she experienced while on temporary assignment in the East Area, a region of Langley unfamiliar to her and where few Blacks worked. Katherine Goble Johnson, for her part, was initially unaware that the bathrooms at Langley were segregated (in both its East and West areas during the NACA era), and used the \"whites-only\" bathrooms (many were not explicitly labeled as such) for years before anyone complained. She ignored the complaint, and the issue was dropped.\nIn an interview with WHRO-TV, Goble Johnson denied the feelings of segregation. \"I didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job [...] and play bridge at lunch. I didn't feel any segregation. I knew it was there, but I didn't feel it.\"\nMary Jackson did not have to get a court order to attend night classes at the whites-only high school. She asked the city of Hampton for an exception, and it was granted. The school turned out to be run down and dilapidated, a hidden cost of running two parallel school systems. She completed her engineering courses and earned a promotion to engineer in 1958.\nKatherine Goble Johnson worked mostly in Langley's West Area, not the East Area – working mainly in Building 1244 starting in mid-1953, and remaining in 1244 even after joining the Space Task Group, through at least the early 1960s and John Glenn's historic flight.\nThe scene where a coffeepot labeled \"colored\" appears in Katherine Goble Johnson's workplace did not happen in real life, and the book on which the film is based mentions no such incident.\nKatherine Goble Johnson carpooled with Eunice Smith, a nine-year West Area computer veteran at the time Goble Johnson joined NACA. Smith was her neighbor and friend from her sorority and church choir. The three Goble children were teenagers at the time of Katherine's marriage to Jim Johnson.\nKatherine Goble Johnson was assigned to the Flight Research Division in 1953, a move that soon became permanent. When the Space Task Group was created in 1958, engineers from the Flight Research Division formed the core of the group, and Goble Johnson was included. She coauthored a research report published by NASA in 1960, the first time a woman in the Flight Research Division had received credit as an author of a research report. Goble Johnson gained access to editorial meetings as of 1958 simply through persistence, not because one particular meeting was critical.\nThe Space Task Group was led by Robert Gilruth, not the fictional character Al Harrison, who was created to simplify a more complex management structure. The scene where Harrison smashes the Colored Ladies Room sign never happened, as in real life Goble Johnson refused to walk the extra distance to use the colored bathroom and, in her words, \"just went to the white one.\" Harrison also lets her into Mission Control to witness the launch. Neither scene happened in real life, and screenwriter Theodore Melfi said he saw no problem with adding the scenes, saying, \"There needs to be white people who do the right thing, there needs to be Black people who do the right thing, and someone does the right thing. And so who cares who does the right thing, as long as the right thing is achieved?\"\nDexter Thomas of Vice News criticized Melfi's additions as creating the white savior trope: \"In this case, it means that a white person doesn't have to think about the possibility that, were they around back in the 1960s South, they might have been one of the bad ones.\" The Atlantic's Megan Garber said that the film's \"narrative trajectory\" involved \"thematic elements of the white savior\". Melfi said he found \"hurtful\" the \"accusations of a 'white savior' storyline\", saying:\n\nIt was very upsetting to me because I am at a place where I've lived my life colorless and I grew up in Brooklyn. I walked to school with people of all shapes, sizes, and colors, and that's how I've lived my life. So it's very upsetting that we still have to have this conversation. I get upset when I hear 'Black film,' and so does Taraji P. Henson [...] It's just a film. And if we keep labeling something 'a Black film,' or 'a white film' – basically it's modern day segregation. We're all humans. Any human can tell any human's story. I don't want to have this conversation about Black film or white film anymore. I wanna have conversations about film.\nThe Huffington Post's Zeba Blay said of Melfi's frustration:\n\nHis frustration is also a perfect example of how, when it comes to open dialogue about depictions of people of color on screen, it behooves white people (especially those who position themselves as 'allies') to listen [...] the inclusion of the bathroom scene doesn't make Melfi a bad filmmaker, or a bad person, or a racist. But his suggestion that a feel-good scene like that was needed for the marketability and overall appeal of the film speaks to the fact that Hollywood at large still has a long way to go in telling Black stories, no matter how many strides have been made.\nThe fictional characters Vivian Mitchell and Paul Stafford are composites of several team members and reflect common social views and attitudes of the time. Karl Zielinski is based on Mary Jackson's mentor, Kazimierz \"Kaz\" Czarnecki.\nJohn Glenn, who was about a decade older than depicted at the time of launch, did ask specifically for Goble Johnson to verify the IBM calculations, although she had several days before the launch date to complete the process.\nAuthor Margot Lee Shetterly has agreed that there are differences between her book and the movie, but found that to be understandable:\n\nFor better or for worse, there is history, there is the book and then there's the movie. Timelines had to be conflated and [there were] composite characters, and for most people [who have seen the movie] have already taken that as the literal fact. [...] You might get the indication in the movie that these were the only people doing those jobs, when in reality we know they worked in teams, and those teams had other teams. There were sections, branches, divisions, and they all went up to a director. There were so many people required to make this happen. [...] It would be great for people to understand that there were so many more people. Even though Katherine Goble Johnson, in this role, was a hero, there were so many others that were required to do other kinds of tests and checks to make [Glenn's] mission come to fruition. But I understand you can't make a movie with 300 characters. It is simply not possible.\nJohn Glenn's flight was not terminated early as stated in the movie's closing subtitles. The MA-6 mission was planned for three orbits and landed at the expected time. The press kit published before launch states that \"The Mercury Operations Director may elect a one, two or three orbit mission.\" The post-mission report also shows that retrofire was scheduled to occur on the third orbit. Scott Carpenter's subsequent flight in May was also scheduled and flew for three orbits, and Wally Schirra's planned six-orbit flight in October required extensive modifications to the Mercury capsule's life-support system to allow him to fly a nine-hour mission. The phrase \"go for at least seven orbits\" that is in the mission transcript refers to the fact that the Atlas booster had placed Glenn's capsule into an orbit that would be stable for at least seven orbits, not that he had permission to stay up that long.\nThe Mercury Control Center was located at Cape Canaveral in Florida, not at the Langley Research Center in Virginia. The orbit plots displayed in the front of the room incorrectly show a six-orbit mission, which did not happen until Wally Schirra's MA-8 mission in October 1962. The movie also incorrectly shows NASA flight controllers monitoring live telemetry from the Soviet Vostok launch, which the Soviet Union would not have been sharing with NASA in 1961.\nKatherine Goble Johnson's Technical Note D-233, co-written with T.H. Skopinski, can be found on the NASA Technical Reports Server.\nThe movie depicts the IBM 7090 as the first computer at Langley, but there were actually earlier computers there, and Dorothy Vaughan had previously been programming for the IBM 704 in FORTRAN.\n\nThe movie refers to an IBM 7090 (first released in 1959), but the console shown is for an IBM 7094 (released in 1962).\n\n\n== Release ==\n\nThe film began a limited release on December 25, 2016, before a wide release on January 6, 2017.\n\n\n=== Charity screenings ===\nAfter Hidden Figures was released on December 25, 2016, certain charities, institutions and independent businesses who regard the film as relevant to the cause of improving youth awareness in education and careers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, organized free screenings of the film in order to spread the message of the film's subject matter. A collaborative effort between Western New York STEM Hub, AT&T and the Girl Scouts of the USA allowed more than 200 Buffalo Public Schools students, Girl Scouts and teachers to see the film. WBFO's Senior Reporter Eileen Buckley stated the event was designed to help encourage a new generation of women to consider STEM careers. Research indicates that by 2020, there will be 2.4 million unfilled STEM jobs. Aspiring astronaut Naia Butler-Craig wrote of the film: \"I can't imagine what that would have been like: 16-year-old, impressionable, curious and space-obsessed Naia finding out that Black women had something to do with getting Americans on the moon.\"\nAlso, the film's principal actors (Henson, Spencer, Monáe and Parsons), director (Melfi), producer/musical creator (Williams), and other non-profit outside groups have offered free screenings to Hidden Figures at several cinema locations around the world. Some of the screenings were open to all-comers, while others were arranged to benefit girls, women and the underprivileged. The campaign began as individual activism by Spencer, and made a total of more than 1,500 seats for Hidden Figures available, free of charge, to poor individuals and families. The result was seven more screenings for people who otherwise might not have been able to afford to see the film - in Atlanta (sponsored by Monáe), in Washington, D.C. (sponsored by Henson), in Chicago (also Henson), in Houston (by Parsons), in Hazelwood, Missouri (by Melfi and actress/co-producer Kimberly Quinn), and in Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Virginia (both sponsored by Williams).\nIn February 2017, AMC Theatres and 21st Century Fox announced that free screenings of Hidden Figures would take place in celebration of Black History Month in up to 14 select U.S. cities (including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Miami). The statement described the February charity screenings as building broader awareness of the film's true story of Black women mathematicians who worked at NASA during the Space Race. 21st Century Fox and AMC Theatres also invited schools, community groups and non-profit organizations to apply for additional special screenings to be held in their towns. \"As we celebrate Black History Month and look ahead to Women's History Month in March, this story of empowerment and perseverance is more relevant than ever,\" said Liba Rubenstein, 21st Century Fox's Senior Vice President of Social Impact, \"We at 21CF were inspired by the grassroots movement to bring this film to audiences that wouldn't otherwise be able to see it - audiences that might include future innovators and barrier-breakers - and we wanted to support and extend that movement\".\nPhilanthropic non-profit outside groups and other local efforts by individuals have offered free screenings of Hidden Figures by using crowdfunding platforms on the Internet, that allow people to raise money for free film screening events. Dozens of other GoFundMe free screening campaigns have appeared since the film's general release, all by people wanting to raise money to pay for students to see the film.\nIn 2019, The Walt Disney Company partnered with the U.S. Department of State on the third annual \"Hidden No More\" exchange program, which was inspired by the film and brings to the United States 50 women from around the world who have excelled in STEM careers such as spacecraft engineering, data solutions and data privacy, and STEM-related education. The exchange program began in 2017 after local US embassies screened the film to their local communities. The support for the screenings was so positive that 48 countries decided to each nominate one woman in STEM to represent their country on a three-week IVLP exchange program in the United States.\n\n\n=== Merchandising ===\nFollowing the 2017 Lego Ideas Contest, Denmark-based toy maker The Lego Group announced plans to manufacture a fan-designed Women of NASA figurine set of five female scientists, engineers and astronauts, as based on real women who have worked for NASA. The minifigures planned for inclusion in the set were Katherine Johnson, computer scientist Margaret Hamilton; astronaut, physicist and educator Sally Ride; astronomer Nancy Grace Roman; and astronaut and physician Mae Jemison (who is also African American). The finished set did not include Johnson. The Women of NASA set was released November 1, 2017.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nHidden Figures was released on Digital HD on March 28, 2017, and Blu-ray, 4K Ultra HD, and DVD on April 11, 2017. The film debuted at No. 3 on the home video sales chart.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nHidden Figures grossed $169.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $66.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $236 million, against a production budget of $25 million. Domestically, Hidden Figures was the highest-grossing Best Picture nominee at the 89th Academy Awards. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $95.55 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it one of the top twenty most profitable release of 2016.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 325 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"In heartwarming, crowd-pleasing fashion, Hidden Figures celebrates overlooked—and crucial—contributions from a pivotal moment in American history.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, one of fewer than 90 films in the history of the service to receive such a score.\nSimon Thompson of IGN gave the film a rating of nine out of ten, writing, \"Hidden Figures fills in an all too forgotten, or simply too widely unknown, blank in US history in a classy, engaging, entertaining and hugely fulfilling way. Superb performances across the board and a fascinating story alone make Hidden Figures a solid, an accomplished and deftly executed movie that entertains, engages and earns your time, money and attention.\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote, \"the film's made with more heart than art and more skill than subtlety, and it works primarily because of the women that it portrays and the actresses who portray them. Best of all, you come out of the movie knowing who Katherine Johnson and Dorothy Vaughn and Mary Jackson are, and so do your daughters and sons.\"\nClayton Davis of Awards Circuit gave the film three and a half stars, saying \"Precisely marketed as terrific adult entertainment for the Christmas season, Hidden Figures is a faithful and truly beautiful portrait of our country's consistent gloss over the racial tensions that have divided and continue to plague the fabric of our existence. Lavishly engaging from start to finish, Hidden Figures may be able to catch the most inopportune movie-goer off guard and cause them to fall for its undeniable and classic storytelling. The film is not to be missed.\"\nOther reviews criticized the film for its fictional embellishments and conventional, feel-good style. Tim Grierson, writing for Screen International, states that \"Hidden Figures is almost patronisingly earnest in its depiction of sexism and racism. An air of do-gooder self-satisfaction hovers over the proceedings\", while Jesse Hassenger at The A.V. Club comments that \"lack of surprise is in this movie's bones.\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire argues that the film \"trivializes history; as a hagiographic tribute to its brilliant protagonists, it doesn't dig into the essence of their struggles\" and similarly, Paul Byrnes concludes that \"When a film purports to be selling history, we're entitled to ask where the history went, even if it offers a good time instead.\"\nIn 2025, entertainer Mel Brooks cited Hidden Figures as among his favorite films of the 21st century.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\nAmong its many achievements, Octavia Spencer was particularly lauded for her portrayal of Dorothy Vaughan and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role. The film's ensemble cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

    "full_narrative": "The Radium Girls were female factory workers who contracted radiation poisoning from painting radium dials – watch dials and hands with self-luminous paint. The incidents occurred at three factories in the United States: one in Orange, New Jersey, beginning around 1917; one in Ottawa, Illinois, beginning in the early 1920s; and one in Waterbury, Connecticut, also in the 1920s.\nAfter being told that the paint was harmless, the women in each facility ingested deadly amounts of radium after being instructed to \"point\" their brushes on their lips in order to give them a fine tip. The women were instructed to point their brushes in this way because using rags or a water rinse caused them to use more time and material, as the paint was made from powdered radium, zinc sulfide (a phosphor), gum arabic, and water.\nThe Radium Girls had lasting effects on the labor laws in the United States and Europe following numerous lawsuits following deaths and illness from ingestion of radium.\n\n\n== United States Radium Corporation ==\n\nFrom 1917 to 1926, the United States Radium Corporation (USRC), originally called the Radium Luminous Material Corporation, was engaged in the extraction and purification of radium from carnotite ore to produce luminous paints, which were marketed under the brand name \"Undark\". The ore was mined from the Paradox Valley in Colorado and other \"Undark mines\" in Utah. As a defense contractor, USRC was a major supplier of radioluminescent watches to the military. Their plant in Orange, New Jersey, employed as many as 300 workers, mainly women, to paint radium-lit watch faces and instruments, misleading them by claiming that it was safe.\n\n\n=== Radiation exposure ===\nUSRC hired approximately 70 women to perform various tasks including handling radium, while the owners and the scientists familiar with the effects of radium carefully avoided any exposure to it themselves. Chemists at the plant used lead screens, tongs, and masks. USRC had distributed literature to the medical community describing the \"injurious effects\" of radium. Despite this knowledge, a number of similar deaths had occurred by 1925, including USRC's chief chemist, Dr. Edwin E. Leman and several female workers. The similar circumstances of their deaths prompted investigations by Dr. Harrison Martland, county physician of Newark.\nAn estimated 4,000 workers were hired by corporations in the U.S. and Canada to paint watch faces with radium. At USRC, each of the painters mixed her own paint in a small crucible, and then used camel hair brushes to apply the glowing paint onto dials. The rate of pay was about a penny and a half per dial (equivalent to $0.368 in 2024), earning the women $3.75 (equivalent to $92.04 in 2024) for painting 250 dials per shift.\nThe brushes would lose shape after a few strokes, so the USRC supervisors encouraged their workers to point the brushes with their lips (\"lip, dip, paint\"), or use their tongues to keep them sharp. Because the true nature of the radium had been kept from them, the Radium Girls also painted their nails, teeth, and faces for fun with the deadly paint produced at the factory. By 1927, more than 50 of the female factory workers had died from radium poisoning caused by the paint used. Several are buried in Orange's Rosedale Cemetery.\nA 1951 LIFE magazine photo-essay kept the story of U.S. Radium's 1920s dial-painters before the public. Spotlighted was the then-recent (1949) sinus-cancer death of Florence Kohler Casler, who had joined USRC in 1917.\n\n\n=== Radiation poisoning ===\n\nDentists were among the first to see numerous problems among dial painters, including dental pain, loose teeth, lesions, and ulcers, as well as the failure of tooth extractions to heal. Many of the women developed anemia, bone fractures, and necrosis of the jaw, a condition now known as radium jaw. The women also experienced suppression of menstruation and sterility.\nAlthough there were claims that the above conditions were caused by X-rays the women received to investigate their health problems, the amount of radiation absorbed would be inconsequential compared to the amount they were exposed to daily at radium dial factories. As the factory workers' health deteriorated they sought medical attention for problems ranging from dental problems to cancer. Columbia University specialist Frederick Flynn was an industrial toxicologist in contract with the USRC. Flynn and many other doctors referred to the patients lacked medical training and licenses to practice.  It turned out at least one of the examinations was a ruse, part of a campaign of disinformation started by the defense contractor. USRC and other watch-dial companies rejected claims that the affected workers were suffering from exposure to radium. For some time, doctors, dentists, and researchers complied with requests from the companies not to release their data. In 1923 the first dial painter died and, before her death, her jaw fell away from her skull. By 1924, 50 women who had worked at the plant were ill, and a dozen had died. At the urging of the companies, medical professionals attributed worker deaths to other causes. Syphilis, a notorious sexually transmitted infection at the time, was often cited in attempts to smear the reputations of the women. The company also claimed that they had hired \"a great many people who were physically unfit to procure employment in other lines of industry\" as an act of kindness.\nThe inventor of radium dial paint, Dr. Sabin Arnold von Sochocky, died in November 1928, becoming the 16th known victim of poisoning by radium dial paint. He had gotten sick from radium in his hands, not the jaw, but the circumstances of his death helped the Radium Girls in court.\n\n\n== Radium Dial Company ==\nThe Radium Dial Company was established in Ottawa, Illinois, in 1922. Like the United States Radium Corporation, the purpose of the studio in Ottawa was to paint dials for clocks, their largest client being Westclox Corporation in Peru, Illinois. Dials painted in Ottawa appeared on Westclox's popular Big Ben, Baby Ben, and travel clocks; and the Radium Dial Corporation hired young women to paint the dials, using the same \"lip, dip, paint\" approach as the women in New Jersey (also used in another unaffiliated plant in Waterbury, Connecticut, that supplied the Waterbury Clock Company).\nFollowing the termination of President Joseph Kelly from the company, Kelly established a competing firm in the town named Luminous Process Company, which also employed women in the same fashion and in the same conditions as the other firms. Employees at Radium Dial began showing signs of radium poisoning in 1926 and 1927 and were unaware of the hearings and trials in New Jersey. Furthermore, Radium Dial leadership authorized physicals and other tests designed to determine the toxicity of radium paint to its employees, but the company did not make the records or results available to employees.\nIn an attempt to end the use of the camel hair brushes, management introduced glass pens with a fine point; however, the workers found that the pens slowed their productivity, and as they were paid by the piece they reverted to using brushes. When word of the New Jersey women and their suits appeared in local newspapers, the women were told that the radium was safe and that employees in New Jersey were showing signs of viral infections. The co-founder of the Radium Luminous Materials Corporation (RLMC), George Willis, lectured the women on the supposed safety of radium. Radium was also advertised to women of the time as a cure-all and an ingredient in several cosmetic product brands including \"Artes\", \"Ramey\", \"Radior\" and \"Tho-Radia\". The cosmetic products containing radium promised regenerative anti-aging properties for a youthful appearance. Dr. von Sochocky told workers that the paint lacked hazardous ingredients. They were also told the radium in the paint was being diluted and could not harm their health. Assured by their employers that the radium was safe, they returned to work as usual.\n\n\n== Significance ==\n\n\n=== Litigation ===\nIn Orange, New Jersey, the story of the abuse perpetrated against the workers is distinguished from most such cases by the fact that the ensuing litigation was covered widely by the media. To explain why the women were unable to appear in court, their attorney said: \"When you have heard that you are going to die, that there is no hope — and every newspaper you pick up prints what really amounts to your obituary — there is nothing else.\"  Plant worker Grace Fryer decided to sue, but it took two years for her to find a lawyer willing to take on USRC. The litigation moved slowly even after the women found a lawyer, and by the time of their first court appearance in January 1928, two women were bedridden, and none of them could raise their arms to take an oath. The five factory workers involved in the suit were dubbed \"the Radium Girls\" – Fryer, Edna Hussman, Katherine Schaub, Quinta McDonald, and Albina Larice. The USRC denied any wrongdoing, but the case was settled in the autumn of 1928, before the trial was deliberated by the jury. The settlement for each of the Radium Girls was $10,000 (equivalent to $183,000 in 2024) and a $600 per year annuity (equivalent to $11,000 in 2024) paid $12 per week (equivalent to $200 in 2024) for all of their lives, and all medical and legal expenses incurred would also be paid by the company. All five of the women were dead by the 1930s.\nIn Illinois, employees began asking for compensation for their medical and dental bills as early as 1927 but were refused by management. The demand for money by sick and dying former employees continued into the mid-1930s before a suit was brought before the Illinois Industrial Commission (IIC). In 1937, five women found attorney Leonard Grossman who would represent them in front of the commission. Grossman took the case without receiving pay as the women were too poor due to inability to work. The case was handled at the home of Catherine Donahue, a woman who was involved but was too sick to travel. In the spring of 1938 the IIC ruled in favor of the women, but by then, Radium Dial had closed and moved to New York, and the IIC refused to cross state boundaries for the women's payout. The IIC did retain a $10,000 deposit left by Radium Dial when it disclosed to the IIC that they could not find any insurance to cover the cost of indemnifying the company against employee suits. The attorney representing the interests of Radium Dial appealed hoping to get the verdict overturned. Radium Dial appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and on October 23, 1939, the court decided not to hear the appeal, and the lower ruling was upheld. Some of the women received no payout, and by the time the matter was officially settled by the Supreme Court, Donahue was dead.\n\n\n=== Historical impact ===\nThe Radium Girls' saga holds an important place in the history of the fields of health physics, women's rights, and the labor rights movement. The right of individual workers to sue for damages from corporations due to labor abuse was established, labor safety standards like the baseline called provable suffering were created. Industrial standards for safety improved as a result, and in 1949, Congress passed a bill that decreed compensation for all workers suffering from occupational diseases.\nThe lawsuit and resulting publicity was a factor in the establishment of occupational disease labor law. Radium Dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear; in particular, they no longer shaped paint brushes by lip and avoided ingesting or breathing the paint. Radium paint was still used in dials as late as the 1970s. The last factory manufacturing radium paint shut down in 1978.\n\n\n=== Scientific impact ===\nRobley D. Evans made the first measurements of exhaled radon and radium excretion from a former dial painter in 1933. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he gathered dependable body content measurements from 27 dial painters. This information was used in 1941 by the National Bureau of Standards to establish a tolerance level for radium at 0.1 μCi (3.7 kBq).\nThe Center for Human Radiobiology was established at Argonne National Laboratory in 1968. The primary purpose of the center was providing medical examinations for living dial painters. The project also focused on the collection of information and, in some cases, tissue samples from the Radium Dial painters. When the project ended in 1993, detailed information of 2,403 cases had been collected.\nThis led to a book on the effects of radium on humans. The book suggests that radium-228 exposure is more harmful to health than exposure to radium-226. Radium-228 is more likely to cause cancer of the bone as the shorter half-life of radon-220 compared to radon-222 causes the daughter nuclides of radium-228 to deliver a greater dose of alpha radiation to the bones. It also considers the induction of several forms of cancer caused by internal exposure to radium and its daughter nuclides. The book used data from Radium Dial painters, people who were exposed as a result of the use of radium-containing medical products, and other groups of people who had been exposed to radium.\n\n\n=== In literature, music, and film ===\nA fictionalized version of the story was featured in the 1937 short story \"Letter to the Editor\" by James H. Street, adapted into a 1937 film Nothing Sacred and a 1953 Broadway musical Hazel Flagg.\nRadium City is a documentary directed by Carole Langer, released in 1987.\nD. W. Gregory wrote a play titled Radium Girls which follows Grace Fryer and the lawsuit in New Jersey. It was published by Dramatists Play Service in 2000.\nIn 2017, Kate Moore published The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America's Shining Women, a narrative account of the women.\nRadium Girls is a film starring Joey King, released in October 2020.\nCatherine Donahue's story was dramatized in the 2010 play These Shining Lives by Melanie Marnich, published by Dramatists Play Service.\nAs of 2025, a stage musical entitled The Radium Girls, directed by Marissa Jaret Winokur and written by Amanda D'Archangelis, Sami Horneff, and Lisa Mongillo, is aiming for a Broadway run.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOccupational disease\nPhossy jaw\nBreaker boy\nKent (cigarette), a brand of cigarettes with asbestos filters said to reduce cancer risk, but which in fact caused mesothelioma, a type of cancer caused by asbestos exposure\nNuclear labor issues\nLabor history\nLabor law\nLabor rights\nKatherine Rotan Drinker and Cecil Kent Drinker, physicians who researched the Radium Girls\nHiroshima Maidens\nRadioactive contamination\nRadium silk\nTritium radioluminescence\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nClark, Claudia (1987).
