WWE Domain - Professional Wrestling Narrative Analysis

"When Everyone Knows It's Fake: The $1B+ Narrative"

This domain represents potentially the HIGHEST narrativity (π) ever measured,
testing whether narrative quality drives engagement when outcomes are explicitly
scripted and everyone knows it.

Key Characteristics:
- Outcomes are fake (predetermined by writers)
- Everyone knows this (Ψ ≈ 0.90 - highest awareness)
- Yet generates $1B+ annually in real revenue
- **Tests whether "fake" can have real effects at extreme high-π**

Framework Variables (Expected):
- π (Openness) ≈ 0.97-0.98 (potentially highest domain ever)
- Λ (Limit) ≈ 0.05 (no physical constraint on storylines)
- Ψ (Witness) ≈ 0.90 (universal knowledge it's scripted)
- Ν (Narrative) ≈ 0.95 (story IS the product)
- Д (Arch) ≈ 0.80 (prestige equation: Ν + Ψ - Λ)

Expected Equation Type: PRESTIGE DOMAIN
- Regular domains: Д = Ν - Ψ - Λ (awareness suppresses)
- Prestige domains: Д = Ν + Ψ - Λ (awareness amplifies!)
- WWE prediction: Awareness AMPLIFIES engagement

Theoretical Significance:
1. Highest π boundary (opposite of Lottery π=0.04)
2. Tests prestige domain dynamics clearly
3. "Kayfabe" = conscious narrative choice (meta-awareness)
4. Proves explicit construction doesn't reduce effects in high-π
5. Validates that "fake" can generate real outcomes

Sample Target: 1,000+ events, 200+ storylines, engagement data
Key Test: Does ю (narrative quality) predict ❊ (viewership/buyrates)?
