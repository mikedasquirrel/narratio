UFC/MMA NARRATIVE ANALYSIS - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

GOAL: Apply narrative framework to UFC fights (potential 3rd PASSING domain!)

WHY UFC: Highest individual narrative in sports
  - Pure 1v1 matchups
  - Fighter personas/trash talk HUGE
  - Name recognition critical
  - Betting market very active
  - Expected п ≈ 0.58 (might PASS threshold!)

APPROACH: Data-first, presume-and-prove, ALL transformers, rich nominative

================================================================================
TASK OVERVIEW
================================================================================

1. Collect UFC fight data (2014-2024, ~500 fights/year = 5,000+ fights)
2. Collect betting odds (moneyline, method of victory, round)
3. Generate fighter narratives (personas, records, styles, trash talk)
4. Apply ALL 25 transformers (nominative-heavy for 1v1 names)
5. Compute narrative quality (ю) 
6. Run presume-and-prove validation
7. Discover where narrative is strongest (data-first)
8. Test betting odds prediction (narrative vs Vegas)
9. Optimize for empirically-discovered contexts

================================================================================
STEP 1: DATA COLLECTION

TARGET: 5,000+ fights (2014-2024)

================================================================================
STEP 2: GENERATE FIGHTER NARRATIVES
================================================================================

FILE: narrative_optimization/domains/ufc/generate_fighter_narratives.py

CREATE: Rich fight narratives (200-300 words) - NOMINATIVE-HEAVY!

INCLUDE EXTENSIVELY:

FIGHTER NAMES (Critical!):
  - Full name: "Alexander Pereira"
  - Nickname: "Poatan" (The Stone Hand)
  - Repeated use: "Pereira", "Alex", "Poatan"
  - Opponent name: "Jamahal Hill"
  - Opponent nickname: "Sweet Dreams"

PERSONA & STYLE (Nominative Context):
  - "Pereira's legendary knockout power"
  - "Hill's slick boxing and confidence"
  - "The silent assassin vs the trash talker"
  - "Brazilian precision vs American swagger"

RECORD & HISTORY:
  - "Pereira (9-2) brings a five-fight win streak"
  - "Hill (12-1, 1 NC) returns from injury"
  - "Both former champions in this division"

STYLISTIC NARRATIVE:
  - "Striker vs striker showdown"
  - "Pereira's devastating left hook vs Hill's speed"
  - "Can Hill's movement neutralize Poatan's power?"

CONTEXT & STAKES:
  - "Light Heavyweight title eliminator"
  - "Winner faces Ankalaev for the vacant belt"
  - "Redemption for both after previous setbacks"

PERSONA CLASH:
  - "Hill's brash confidence vs Pereira's quiet intensity"
  - "The showman vs the executioner"
  - "Contrasting personalities, similar goals"

EXAMPLE NARRATIVE:
"Alex 'Poatan' Pereira (9-2) faces Jamahal 'Sweet Dreams' Hill (12-1, 1 NC) 
in a light heavyweight title eliminator at UFC 300. The former Glory Kickboxing 
champion Pereira brings legendary knockout power, having finished five straight 
opponents with devastating strikes. His silent assassin persona contrasts 
sharply with Hill's brash confidence and verbal warfare.

Hill, the former 205-pound champion, returns from a torn Achilles seeking 
redemption against the Brazilian powerhouse. Sweet Dreams' slick boxing and 
supreme self-belief face the ultimate test in Poatan's granite fists. Both 
strikers prefer to stand and trade, setting up a potential war.

Pereira's path from kickboxing to UFC dominance has been meteoric, while Hill's 
comeback story inspires. The stylistic matchup favors the knockout artist, but 
Hill's speed and movement could frustrate the slower Pereira. Winner advances 
to face Magomed Ankalaev for the vacant light heavyweight championship.

The persona clash amplifies the stakes: Hill's trash talk versus Pereira's 
actions-speak-louder approach. Can Sweet Dreams' confidence overcome Poatan's 
proven power? Las Vegas awaits the answer."

LENGTH: 200-300 words
NAMES: 15-20 mentions (fighters, coaches, opponents, champions)
PERSONAS: Emphasize character/style clash
NOMINATIVE RICHNESS: Maximum

================================================================================
STEP 3: APPLY ALL 25 TRANSFORMERS
================================================================================

FILE: narrative_optimization/domains/ufc/analyze_ufc_complete.py

IMPORT ALL TRANSFORMERS:

from src.transformers import (
    # Core (6) - CRITICAL for UFC
    NominativeAnalysisTransformer,      # Fighter names - HUGE!
    SelfPerceptionTransformer,          # Persona, confidence, mindset
    NarrativePotentialTransformer,      # Redemption, comeback, momentum
    LinguisticPatternsTransformer,      # Narrative structure
    EnsembleNarrativeTransformer,       # Training camps, corner teams
    RelationalValueTransformer,         # Fighter matchup complementarity
    
    # Semantic
    EmotionalSemanticTransformer,       # Aggression, confidence, fear
    
    # Structural  
    ConflictTensionTransformer,         # Rivalry, stakes, grudges - HUGE for UFC!
    SuspenseMysteryTransformer,         # Upset potential, underdog
    FramingTransformer,                 # Media hype, perception
    
    # Credibility
    AuthenticityTransformer,            # Real vs hype, legitimacy
    ExpertiseAuthorityTransformer,      # Experience, skills, pedigree
    
    # Contextual
    CulturalContextTransformer,         # Nationality, style, background
    TemporalTransformer,                # Career momentum, timing
    
    # Statistical
    StatisticalTransformer,             # Baseline
    
    # Nominative-specific
    PhoneticTransformer,                # Name sounds, memorability
    
    # All others available
)

PROCESS:

1. Load fight narratives (nominative-rich!)

2. Apply ALL 25 transformers:
   
   NOMINATIVE will extract:
   - Fighter name phonetics (harsh vs soft names)
   - Nickname patterns ("Poatan", "Sweet Dreams")
   - Name memorability
   - Cultural name associations
   - Name length, syllables
   - Relational name patterns (matchup)
   
   ENSEMBLE will extract:
   - Training camp names (Jackson-Wink, ATT, etc.)
   - Corner team dynamics
   - Coach names (if mentioned)
   
   CONFLICT/TENSION will extract:
   - Rivalry language
   - Grudge match indicators
   - Stakes mentions
   - Revenge narrative
   - Bad blood markers
   
   SELF-PERCEPTION will extract:
   - Confidence language
   - Persona markers (silent vs loud)
   - Mindset indicators
   - Trash talk patterns
   
3. Combine → ж (genome)
   Expected: 400-500 features (nominative-heavy!)

4. Compute ю (story quality)
   Weight nominative HIGH (UFC is persona-driven)

5. Measure |r| with fight outcomes

IMPORTANT: UFC is NOMINATIVE + PERSONA domain
  - Fighter names are the brand
  - Personas drive narratives
  - 1v1 = pure individual name effects
  - Use ALL transformers, let data show which matter most

================================================================================
STEP 4: CALCULATE NARRATIVITY (п)
================================================================================

UFC DOMAIN CHARACTERISTICS:

п_structural: 0.70
  - Many possible fight paths (striker, grappler, wrestle-boxer)
  - Not as constrained as team sports
  - Individual creativity high

п_temporal: 0.65
  - Fights unfold over 15-25 minutes
  - Rounds create temporal structure
  - Career arcs over years (comebacks, declines)

п_agency: 0.95
  - Fighters have extreme agency (choose style, tactics)
  - No team constraining individual
  - Coach advice but fighter executes

п_interpretation: 0.70
  - Judges score (if decision)
  - But finish = objective
  - Style preferences subjective
  - Fan perception matters for careers

п_format: 0.40
  - Rules constrain (rounds, weight classes, illegal moves)
  - Octagon format rigid
  - But fighting style very flexible

CALCULATED п:
п = 0.30(0.70) + 0.20(0.65) + 0.25(0.95) + 0.15(0.70) + 0.10(0.40)
п = 0.21 + 0.13 + 0.24 + 0.11 + 0.04
п ≈ 0.73

INTERPRETATION: HIGH NARRATIVITY!
  - Higher than all team sports (NBA 0.49, NFL ~0.48)
  - Individual agency + persona-driven
  - Might PASS threshold if |r| > 0.45

================================================================================
STEP 5: PRESUME AND PROVE
================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS:
  "Narrative laws should apply to UFC fights"
  Test: Д/п > 0.5 (efficiency threshold)
  
EXPECTATION:
  п ≈ 0.73 (HIGH - individual narrative)
  Expected |r| ≈ 0.4-0.6 (persona matters!)
  Expected κ ≈ 0.6 (judges evaluate but fans/media matter)
  Predicted Д = 0.73 × 0.5 × 0.6 = 0.219
  Efficiency = 0.30 (close to threshold!)
  
  BUT: If |r| > 0.6, could PASS!

MEASURE:
  1. Extract ю from ALL transformers
  2. Measure actual |r| with fight outcomes
  3. Calculate Д = п × |r| × κ
  4. Test: Д/п > 0.5?

VALIDATE:
  - Report honest pass/fail
  - If PASS: UFC is 3rd passing domain! (after Character, Self-Rated)
  - If FAIL: Still higher than team sports (valuable!)

REGISTER:
  - Add to CrossDomainValidator
  - Update spectrum (fills 0.70-0.75 gap perfectly!)

================================================================================
STEP 6: DATA-FIRST DISCOVERY
================================================================================

FILE: narrative_optimization/domains/ufc/discover_ufc_contexts.py

MEASURE |r| EXHAUSTIVELY ACROSS:

FIGHTER-LEVEL (Nominative Discovery):
  - Fighter name phonetics (harsh vs soft names)
  - Nickname effects ("Bones", "The Spider", "Notorious")
  - Name memorability patterns
  - Name length by outcome
  - Cultural name patterns (Brazilian, Russian, American, etc.)
  - Trash talker vs silent type
  - Persona type (villain, hero, underdog, champion)

MATCHUP-LEVEL (1v1 Nominative):
  - Fighter A name vs Fighter B name patterns
  - Nickname clash effects
  - Persona contrast (loud vs quiet)
  - Style narrative (striker vs grappler)
  - Experience gap (veteran vs rookie)
  - Confidence language differential

CONTEXT-LEVEL:
  - Title fights vs non-title
  - Main event vs prelims
  - Weight class (Heavyweight, Light Heavyweight, Middleweight, etc.)
  - Location (Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi, Brazil, etc.)
  - Grudge match vs respectful
  - Rematch vs first fight
  - PPV vs Fight Night

OUTCOME-LEVEL:
  - Finish vs decision
  - Method (KO vs Submission vs Decision)
  - Round ended
  - Underdog win vs favorite win
  - Close fight vs dominant

TEMPORAL-LEVEL:
  - Year (2014-2024)
  - Fighter age categories
  - Career phase (rising, peak, declining)
  - Win streak length
  - Time since last fight

RANK: By |r| (absolute correlation)

DISCOVER: Top 50 contexts where narrative is empirically strongest

HYPOTHESIS: 
  • Fighter personas might have |r| > 0.5
  • Trash talkers vs silent might differ
  • Title fights higher stakes → higher |r|
  • Main events > prelims

LET DATA SHOW US (don't predict!)

================================================================================
STEP 7: BETTING ODDS INTEGRATION
================================================================================

FILE: narrative_optimization/domains/ufc/test_ufc_betting_edge.py

UFC BETTING MARKETS (Test All):

1. FIGHT WINNER (Moneyline):
   - Narrative model: Predict from ю
   - Odds model: Use moneyline favorite
   - Combined: ю + odds
   - Test: Does narrative beat Vegas?

2. METHOD OF VICTORY:
   - KO/TKO: Aggressive narrative?
   - Submission: Grappler narrative?
   - Decision: Even narrative?
   - Test: Can narrative predict method?

3. UNDERDOG UPSETS:
   - Like NBA inverse pattern?
   - Do underdogs have better personas?
   - If r negative: narrative indicates underdog
   - Test: Narrative + odds for upset detection

4. FINISH vs DECISION:
   - Finishing narrative vs technical?
   - Test: Narrative predicts entertainment?

5. ROUND BETTING:
   - Early finish vs goes distance
   - Aggressive narrative → early finish?

OUTPUTS:
  - Narrative-only accuracy: Expected 55-60%
  - Odds-only accuracy: Expected 65-70% (Vegas good)
  - Combined accuracy: Expected 70-75%?
  - Narrative edge: 0-5% (if exists)
  - Method prediction: Might be stronger than winner!
  - Underdog detection: Narrative might excel here

HYPOTHESIS: Narrative might beat odds for:
  - Underdog upsets (persona > stats)
  - Method of victory (style > record)
  - Entertainment value (finish > decision)

================================================================================
STEP 8: NOMINATIVE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
================================================================================

UFC IS PURE NOMINATIVE MATCHUP - Exploit This!

FIGHTER NAME ANALYSIS:

1. PHONETIC PATTERNS:
   - Harsh names (Khabib, Conor) vs Soft names
   - Memorability by phonetic structure
   - Nickname phonetics ("Bones" vs "Blessed")

2. CULTURAL PATTERNS:
   - Brazilian fighters: Name patterns?
   - Russian fighters: Name patterns?
   - American fighters: Different patterns?
   - Does cultural name background predict?

3. PERSONA-NAME ALIGNMENT:
   - Do harsh names correlate with aggressive style?
   - Do soft names correlate with technical style?
   - Name-persona fit → better performance?

4. NICKNAME EFFECTS:
   - Intimidating nicknames ("The Spider", "Bones")
   - Inspirational nicknames ("Blessed", "The Answer")
   - Nickname memorability → name recognition → pressure?

5. NAME MATCHUP:
   - Short name vs long name
   - Harsh vs soft in matchup
   - Memorable vs forgettable
   - Cultural clash in names

ENSEMBLE (Training Camps):
  - Jackson-Wink MMA (Greg Jackson, Mike Winkeljohn)
  - American Top Team (names of corner)
  - SBG Ireland (John Kavanagh)
  - Camp name prestige → fighter confidence?

MEASURE |r| for ALL name dimensions - let data show patterns!

================================================================================
STEP 9: EXPECTED NARRATIVITY POTENTIAL
================================================================================

UFC CHARACTERISTICS:

HIGH NARRATIVITY FACTORS:
  ✓ Individual agency (п_agency = 0.95)
  ✓ Persona-driven (fighter brands)
  ✓ Trash talk/hype culture
  ✓ Many stylistic paths
  ✓ Comebacks, redemption arcs
  ✓ Grudge matches amplify stakes

CONSTRAINTS:
  ❌ Physical performance still matters
  ❌ Rules constrain actions
  ❌ Weight classes limit matchups
  ❌ Judges can be inconsistent

CALCULATED: п ≈ 0.73

COUPLING ESTIMATE:
  κ ≈ 0.6 (moderate-high)
  - Judges evaluate performance
  - But media/fans determine careers
  - Fighter persona influences opportunities
  - Trash talk affects opponent mentality
  - Not pure self-rated (κ < 1)
  - Not pure external (κ > 0.3)

PREDICTED OUTCOME:

If |r| ≈ 0.5 (moderate persona effect):
  Д = 0.73 × 0.5 × 0.6 = 0.219
  Efficiency = 0.30 (FAILS, but close!)

If |r| ≈ 0.6 (strong persona effect):
  Д = 0.73 × 0.6 × 0.6 = 0.263
  Efficiency = 0.36 (FAILS, but approaching!)

If |r| ≈ 0.7 (very strong persona effect):
  Д = 0.73 × 0.7 × 0.6 = 0.307
  Efficiency = 0.42 (FAILS, but high!)

If |r| ≈ 0.85 (extreme persona dominance):
  Д = 0.73 × 0.85 × 0.6 = 0.372
  Efficiency = 0.51 (PASSES! ✓)

CONCLUSION: UFC could PASS if |r| > 0.85
  - Possible for title fights?
  - Grudge matches?
  - Trash talker matchups?
  - Let data discover!

================================================================================
STEP 10: DATA-FIRST DISCOVERIES TO EXPECT
================================================================================

MEASURE EVERYTHING, DISCOVER PATTERNS:

Likely Discoveries:
  • Title fights: |r| > 0.5? (highest stakes)
  • Trash talk level: Intense > Minimal?
  • Grudge matches: |r| > 0.6? (bad blood)
  • Main events: |r| > prelims?
  • Specific fighters: Conor, Khabib, Jones - unique patterns?
  • Fighter personas: Villain vs hero effects?
  • Cultural clashes: Different patterns?
  • Experience gaps: Veteran vs rookie name effects?

Possible Surprises (Like Horror for Movies):
  • Unexpected weight class has highest |r|
  • Specific persona type dominates
  • Underdog narratives (inverse pattern)
  • Method prediction > winner prediction
  • Nickname effects > real name effects

GOAL: Find 20-30 contexts, rank by |r|, optimize top 10

PASSING THRESHOLD:
  - Need |r| > 0.85 to pass overall
  - But subdivisions might pass with lower |r| if п_eff or κ higher
  - Title fights: п_eff ≈ 0.80, κ ≈ 0.7 → need |r| > 0.6
  - Grudge matches: κ ≈ 0.75 → need |r| > 0.55
  
POTENTIAL: 5-10 UFC contexts might PASS!

================================================================================
STEP 11: IMPLEMENTATION FILES
================================================================================

CREATE:

1. domains/ufc/__init__.py
2. domains/ufc/collect_ufc_data.py (data collection)
3. domains/ufc/generate_fighter_narratives.py (narrative generation)

  - domains/ufc/ufc_betting_analysis.json (edge testing)

================================================================================
STEP 12: ANALYSIS QUESTIONS
================================================================================

FRAMEWORK VALIDATION:
  1. What is UFC's actual п? (calculate from data)
  2. What is measured |r|? (fighter narrative → outcome)
  3. Does UFC pass Д/п > 0.5? (could be 3rd passer!)
  4. Is r positive or negative? (personas help or indicate?)

NOMINATIVE DISCOVERIES:
  5. Which FIGHTERS have highest |r|? (Conor, Khabib, Jones?)
  6. Do fighter NAME patterns predict? (phonetics, length, culture)
  7. Do NICKNAMES matter? (intimidating vs inspirational)
  8. PERSONA types: Villain vs hero |r|?
  9. TRASH TALK: Does it predict outcomes?
  10. MATCHUP names: Complementary vs contrasting?
  11. TRAINING CAMP names: Does camp prestige matter?

CONTEXT DISCOVERIES:
  12. TITLE FIGHTS: |r| higher? (biggest stakes)
  13. GRUDGE MATCHES: |r| higher? (bad blood)
  14. MAIN EVENTS vs prelims?
  15. WEIGHT CLASSES: Different patterns?
  16. REMATCHES: Revenge narrative effects?

BETTING EDGE:
  17. Narrative beats odds for underdogs?
  18. Narrative predicts method better than winner?
  19. Combined model improves on Vegas?
  20. Where is narrative edge strongest?

================================================================================
STEP 13: SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

MINIMUM SUCCESS:
  ✓ Complete data collection (5,000+ fights)
  ✓ ALL transformers applied
  ✓ Presume-and-prove validation complete
  ✓ Measured |r| and calculated Д
  ✓ Honest pass/fail reported

GOOD SUCCESS:
  ✓ Above +
  ✓ Data-first discovery complete (50+ contexts)
  ✓ Top 10 contexts identified by |r|
  ✓ Betting odds comparison done
  ✓ Nominative patterns discovered

EXCELLENT SUCCESS:
  ✓ Above +
  ✓ UFC PASSES threshold! (3rd passing domain)
  ✓ OR: Specific contexts pass (title fights, grudge matches)
  ✓ Narrative edge found in betting
  ✓ Unexpected patterns discovered (like Horror for movies)
  ✓ Nominative effects quantified (fighter names matter X%)

================================================================================
STEP 14: INTEGRATION WITH FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

AFTER ANALYSIS:

1. Register in CrossDomainValidator
2. Add to spectrum visualization (fills 0.70-0.75 gap!)
3. Update formulas page with UFC results
4. Add UFC route to Flask app
5. Create UFC dashboard page
6. Document discoveries
7. Update README spectrum table

IF UFC PASSES:
  - Update pass rate: 3/11 domains (27%)
  - Celebrate: First combat sport validated!
  - Analyze: Why UFC passes but team sports fail?
  - Theory: Individual agency + persona > team performance constraints

================================================================================
KEY PRINCIPLES FOR UFC
================================================================================

1. TREAT AS UNKNOWN DOMAIN
   - Calculate п from scratch
   - Don't assume like NBA/NFL
   - Let data reveal true narrativity

2. NOMINATIVE-FIRST
   - Fighter names ARE the narrative
   - Personas built around names
   - 1v1 = purest nominative test
   - Exploit maximum name richness

3. ALL TRANSFORMERS
   - Don't pre-select
   - UFC might use unexpected transformers
   - Data shows which matter

4. DATA-FIRST DISCOVERY
   - Measure |r| in ALL contexts
   - Rank empirically
   - Don't predict winners - discover them

5. PERSONA = NARRATIVE
   - Trash talk is narrative
   - Confidence is narrative
   - Style clash is narrative
   - Fighter brand is narrative

================================================================================
EXPECTED TIMELINE
================================================================================

Week 1: Data Collection
  - Scrape/API 5,000+ fights
  - Collect betting odds
  - Get fighter bios/personas
  
Week 2: Narrative Generation
  - Generate 200-300 word narratives
  - Include fighter names extensively
  - Persona emphasis
  - Nominative-rich content

Week 3: Transformer Application
  - Apply ALL 25 transformers
  - Extract 400-500 features
  - Compute ю
  - Presume-and-prove validation

Week 4: Discovery & Optimization
  - Data-first discovery (50+ contexts)
  - Betting odds testing
  - Report findings
  - Integration

TOTAL: 4 weeks to complete UFC domain

================================================================================
WHY UFC MIGHT PASS (Hopeful but Data Will Decide)
================================================================================

FACTORS FAVORING PASS:
  • High п (0.73 - highest team sport)
  • Individual agency (not team constrained)
  • Persona-driven (narrative IS the product)
  • Trash talk culture (narrative amplification)
  • Fan/media matter (higher κ than pure performance)
  • 1v1 clarity (clean narrative matchup)

FACTORS AGAINST:
  • Physical performance still matters
  • Finish = objective outcome
  • Skill/training dominate

REALISTIC EXPECTATION:
  - Overall UFC: Probably fails (eff ≈ 0.30-0.40)
  - BUT: Title fights might pass (higher stakes, higher κ)
  - Grudge matches might pass (narrative maximized)
  - Trash talk matchups might pass (persona clash)

EVEN IF FAILS:
  - Still higher than team sports
  - Validates individual > team for narrative
  - Nominative effects quantified
  - Betting edge possible

VALUE EITHER WAY: High!

================================================================================
READY TO IMPLEMENT
================================================================================

Status: Instructions complete
Next: Bot implements UFC data collection & analysis
Expected: 4 weeks to complete domain
Potential: 3rd passing domain (if |r| > 0.85)
