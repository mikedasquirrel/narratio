Lottery Numbers Domain - Pure Randomness Boundary Case

Tests whether "lucky numbers" actually win more often.
(Spoiler: They don't - this is pure physics/statistics)

Framework Variables:
- π (Openness) = 0.05 (lowest - pure random draw)
- Λ (Limit) = 0.95 (highest - mathematics determines outcome)
- Ψ (Witness) = 0.70 (high awareness it's random)
- Ν (Narrative) = 0.05 (weak - beliefs exist but don't work)
- Д (Arch) = 0.00 (narrative completely ineffective)

This domain serves as:
1. Lower boundary of π spectrum (even lower than Aviation)
2. Control case showing narrative CANNOT overcome physics
3. Proof that framework correctly predicts null effects
4. Perfect contrast to Housing (both "just numbers", opposite outcomes)

Key Test: Do culturally "lucky" numbers (7, 8, 777, 888, birthdays) 
          win more often than random expectation?
Expected: NO - perfect uniformity
