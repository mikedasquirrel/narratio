  "Akron Zips": {
    "biography": "The Akron Zips men's basketball team represents the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. The team currently competes in the Mid-American Conference East division. The Zips are currently coached by John Groce. Prior to becoming members of the MAC in 1992, the Zips were members of the Ohio Valley Conference and the Mid-Continent Conference. They had played in NCAA Division II into the mid 1970s, where they reached the National Championship Game twice, both of which they lost.\nThe Zips have appeared in the NCAA tournament seven times, most recently in 2025. The team first played in the NCAA tournament in 1986 when Bob Huggins was its coach. In 2006, the Zips received an invitation to the NIT and won their first post season game at Temple University before falling in the second round. In 2007, the team won their second MAC East title and tied the school record for wins in a season in the Division I era with 26. They also made their first appearance in the MAC Tournament Championship game, which they lost on a last-second shot 53\u201352 to the Miami RedHawks. The loss cost them the MAC's automatic berth and they were subsequently not selected for either the 2007 NCAA tournament or NIT, despite finishing with a 26\u20137 record. The Zips posted a 24\u201311 record (11\u20135 in the MAC) in 2008 which included a second-straight appearance in the MAC tournament championship game and a berth in the 2008 National Invitation Tournament.\n\nHistory\nThe team was established in 1901, when the school was still known as Buchtel College, playing out of Crouse Gym, the school's original building, built in 1888. They played their first game against Mount Union College, a 120\u20139 loss. The team played just four games in the 1901\u20131902 season, winning their final two against the Western Reserve College medical school. The team's first three seasons were spent without the benefit of a head coach. This changed with the arrival of the first head coach, Earl Williams, who would coach from 1904 to 1908.\n\nEarly history\nGrowing too big for Crouse, the team began playing at the Akron Armory, just a few blocks off-campus, in the 1920s. The Zips began play in the Ohio Athletic Conference in 1923 where they would compete from 1923 to 1965 except for 1936\u20131944 when the University left the OAC and competed as an independent. During their first season back in the OAC, Akron would unknowingly find themselves on the opposite end on what could be considered the first gambling scandal in college basketball history with five of Brooklyn College's players being arrested in a failed attempt to throw a January 29, 1945 game against Akron. In the OAC, Akron would win 8 conference titles and five tournament titles, three of them under legendary coach, Tony Laterza. In 1954 the Zips moved into their own on-campus home, Memorial Hall, located to the east of Crouse Gym.\nAfter the 1965\u20131966 season Akron left the OAC for good and competed as an independent in the NCAA's College Division, which would later be renamed Division II. When the NCAA divided into three divisions in 1973, the Zips would play one season in Division III before moving to Division II, where they would play from 1975 to 1980. During the final three years as a Division II member, the Zips were part of an earlier Mid-Continent Conference for two years before joining the Ohio Valley Conference for the 1979\u20131980 season (though they did not play conference games until the 1980\u20131981 season), their last in Division II.\nThe Zips participated in the NCAA Division II tournament on seven different occasions, making the Division II Final Four three times (1964, 1966, and 1972) and reaching the championship game in 1964 and 1972, falling to Evansville and Roanoke, respectively. Coach Laterza's winning percentage at UA of .751 (178\u201359 from 1960 to 1968) remains best in the history of the program.\n\nOAC regular-season titles: 1934, 1945, 1946, 1953, 1956, 1958, 1965, 1966\nOAC tournament titles: 1959, 1964, 1965, 1966\nNAIA tournament appearance: 1943\nNCAA Division II tournament appearances: 1958, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1971, 1972, 1975\nNCAA Division II Final Four: 1964, 1966, 1972\nNCAA Division II runner-up: 1964, 1972\n\nDivision I era\nAkron attained NCAA Division I status in 1980 and began play in the Ohio Valley Conference that fall. In 1983, the Zips moved into their current arena, the James A. Rhodes Arena, just to the east of old Memorial Hall. In 1984 Bob Huggins began coaching the team, leading the Zips to the 1986 OVC title and tournament title to gain their first berth in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a No. 15 seed, where they fell to the 5th-ranked and No. 2-seeded Michigan Wolverines 70\u201364 in the first round. Akron would play one more season in the OVC and earn a berth in the 1987 National Invitation Tournament before another stint as an independent from 1987 to 1990. Huggins would lead the Zips to the 1989 NIT before leaving Akron after the season to coach at Cincinnati. Akron would rejoin the Mid-Continent Conference in 1990 and compete for two seasons before officially beginning play in the Mid-American Conference in 1992. The Zips struggled early on as members of the MAC including a disastrous 0\u201318 MAC season in 1995\u20131996 which saw the Zips finish the season 3\u201323 overall on a 21-game losing streak after a 3\u20131 start. Akron posted their first winning season in MAC play during the 1997\u20131998 season under coach Dan Hipsher going 13\u20135 and winning the first MAC East division title and qualifying for the MAC tournament for the first time. The Zips posted winning MAC records in 1998\u20131999 and 1999\u20132000 before struggling for several seasons, ultimately leading to the dismissal of Hipsher and the hiring of Keith Dambrot as head coach in 2004.\n\nKeith Dambrot era\nDambrot had previously coached at nearby St. Vincent - St. Mary High School in Akron and had coached LeBron James. Dambrot lead a resurgence in Zips basketball, posting a winning record (19\u201310, 11\u20137 MAC) in the 2004\u20132005 season, their first winning campaign since 2000, and a second MAC East division title in 2007. Under Dambrot, the Zips had won 21 or more games in each of the last 12 seasons (beginning in 2005\u20132006) and had made ten postseason appearances: the 2009, 2011, and 2013 NCAA tournament, the 2006, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2017 NIT, the 2010 CBI, and the 2014 CIT.  The 2006\u20132007 team tied the school record for wins, finishing 26\u20137, but failed to earn an invitation to any postseason tournament. In 2007, the Zips advanced to the MAC tournament championship game for the first time in program history, losing on a last-second shot 53\u201352 to the Miami RedHawks at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. They made a second appearance in 2008, falling to arch-rival Kent State 74\u201355. Finally, in 2009, the Zips defeated Buffalo in the MAC Championship Game and advanced to their first NCAA tournament in 23 years, falling to Gonzaga in Round One. The Zips fell to Ohio in the 2010 MAC Championship Game, but returned to beat Kent State in the 2011 MAC Championship Game (their 5th consecutive appearance in the title game) to advance to the NCAA tournament for the 2nd time in 3 seasons. Dambrot left the Zips to take a head coaching position at Duquesne University.\n\nJohn Groce era\nGroce had coached at the University of Illinois  since 2012 before being hired as the Head coach for the Zips. The Zips had a rough start adjusting to their new head coach, finishing 14-18 overall on the season and losing to Eastern Michigan in the Quarterfinals of the  MAC tournament 58-67. During the 2019-2020 season the Zips finally caught their stride with Groce at the helm finishing the season with a record of 24-7, the best since Groce began his tenure. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the MAC tournament was cancelled and no conference champion was crowned.\n\nMAC season records\n* \u2013Tournament Titles shaded in \u2588\u2588 dark gold.

  "Alabama Crimson Tide": {
    "biography": "The Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team represents the University of Alabama in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The program plays in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Among SEC teams it trails only long-time basketball powerhouse Kentucky in SEC tournament titles, is third behind Kentucky and Tennessee in SEC regular season conference titles, and is fourth behind Kentucky, Texas, and Arkansas in total wins. Alabama was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1929\u201330 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. The team has appeared in the NCAA tournament 25 times, most recently in 2025, and has made ten Sweet Sixteens, three Elite Eights, and one Final Four in the tournament.  Alabama's current head coach is Nate Oats.\nThe men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach Wimp Sanderson and in the 1970s under coach C. M. Newton. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003. In the 2003\u201304 season, the team defeated #1-seeded Stanford in the NCAA tournament, and reached the Elite Eight round for the first time where they lost to the eventual national champion, Connecticut.\nUnder Nate Oats, the team earned SEC titles in 2021 and 2023. In the latter year, the Crimson Tide achieved their best-ever season in program history to that point, earning the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament. They fell to the eventual runner-up, San Diego State, in the Sweet Sixteen. In the 2024 NCAA tournament, they defeated #1-seeded North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen, and defeated #6-seeded Clemson in the Elite Eight to advance to their first Final Four appearance in the school's history where they lost to the eventual national champion, UConn.\n\nHistory\nFormer coaches with at least five years with the Crimson Tide include the following: Hank Crisp (1923\u20131942, 1945\u20131946), Hayden Riley (1960\u20131968), C. M. Newton (1968\u20131980), Wimp Sanderson (1980\u20131992) \u2013 Alabama's winningest coach (.692), David Hobbs (1992\u20131998), Mark Gottfried (1998\u20132009), and Anthony Grant (2009\u20132015).\nOther coaches include John Dee, D.V. Graves, Floyd Burdette, and Charles A. Bernier.\n\nC. M. Newton\nIn 1968, legendary Alabama football coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, who was also Alabama's athletic director, called Kentucky men's basketball coach Adolph Rupp looking for someone to turn around Alabama's basketball program. Rupp recommended C. M. Newton, a former backup player at Kentucky who had been at Transylvania University for 12 years.  In 12 seasons at Alabama, Newton led the Tide to a record of 211\u2013123. The Crimson Tide won three straight SEC titles under Newton (1974, 1975, and 1976), the only program besides Kentucky to accomplish this feat.  Newton also guided Alabama to four NIT and two NCAA Men's Division I Championship tournament berths, prompting the school to name a recruiting suite in his honor in 2006.\nJust as he did at Transylvania, Newton recruited Alabama's first black player, Wendell Hudson, in 1969, integrating his second team in as many coaching stops.\n\nWimp Sanderson\nNewton resigned as head coach after the 1980\u201381 season to become assistant commissioner of the SEC.  He was succeeded by his top assistant, Wimp Sanderson.  He had been at Alabama since 1960 as a graduate assistant to Newton's predecessor, Hayden Riley; he was named a full-fledged assistant in 1961.  In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267\u2013119 record, and they won 4 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and eight NCAA tournaments making the \"Sweet 16\" five times. Sanderson is the only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the SEC Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987.\nSanderson was best known for wearing garish plaid sports jackets on the sidelines.  At one point, Coleman Coliseum was known as the \"Plaid Palace\", and the mid-court logo was painted in a crimson-and-white plaid pattern.\n\nDavid Hobbs\nHobbs was hired at Alabama as an assistant coach for Wimp Sanderson in 1985 and spent seven years as an assistant in Tuscaloosa helping the Crimson Tide win one SEC Championship and four SEC Tournament crowns while the Tide made four appearances in the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16. As an assistant, he had the opportunity to coach such All-SEC performers as Robert Horry, James \"Hollywood\" Robinson and Latrell Sprewell.\nWhen Sanderson left Alabama following the 1992 season, Hobbs was named head coach. In his first season, the Tide finished 16\u201313 and advanced to the NIT. In 1994 and 1995, Alabama recorded 20-win seasons and advanced to the NCAA tournament behind the play of future NBA All-Star Antonio McDyess. In 1996, Hobbs led UA to a 19\u201313 mark and a berth in the NIT Final Four. He resigned his post following the 1998 season after compiling a 110\u201376 (.594) career record and producing nine All-SEC players.\n\nMark Gottfried\nMark Gottfried served as the Crimson Tide's head coach from the 1998\u201399 season until midway through the 2008\u201309 season. Gottfried played 3 seasons of basketball at Alabama under Wimp Sanderson, and the Crimson Tide advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in each of those seasons. He was hired by Alabama in March 1998 after coaching at Murray State for three seasons.\nThe Crimson Tide achieved the highest pinnacle ever for the school in both the NCAA Championship tournament and the Associated Press Poll reaching the Elite Eight in the tournament in 2004 and reaching the No. 1 spot in the nation in the AP poll in 2002, both under Mark Gottfried's command.\nGottfried led the Tide to its only SEC Championship under his watch during the 2001\u201302 season, although the team never won a conference tournament championship during his tenure. For his efforts in 2002, Gottfried was named SEC Coach of the Year by both the Associated Press and his fellow Southeastern Conference coaches. Perhaps his biggest accomplishment as coach at Alabama was leading the Crimson Tide to five consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2002 to 2006, another first for the school that occurred under his watch.\nGottfried resigned on January 26, 2009, with 11 regular season games still remaining on the team's schedule.  Then Athletic Director Mal Moore named long-time Alabama assistant and former player, Philip Pearson as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2008\u201309 season.\n\nAnthony Grant\nOn March 27, 2009 Anthony Grant agreed in principle to become the 20th Crimson Tide head men's basketball coach.  Grant came to Alabama after serving as the head coach at VCU from 2006 to 2009.\nAfter a mediocre first season, Grant led the veteran 2010\u201311 team to a SEC West title and a 2nd-place finish in the 2011 NIT. The 2011\u201312 team endured the suspensions of several star players to finish with a 21\u201312 record and a berth in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they lost in the round of 64 to Creighton.  This was the Crimson Tide's first trip to the NCAA tournament since 2006.  In March 2015, Grant was fired by Alabama after six seasons.  Assistant coach John Brannen served as interim head coach for the 2015 NIT tournament.\n\nAvery Johnson\nOn April 5, 2015, Avery Johnson agreed to become Alabama's next head coach. The former NBA coach said he was attracted to the position because he perceived it as \"a big challenge\" in that Alabama is not a \"perennial favorite\" and has never won a championship before.  Johnson's 2017\u201318 team finished with a 20\u201316 (8\u201310) record and was invited to the NCAA tournament. The next season, the Tide finished 18\u201316 (8\u201310) and Johnson was let go at the end of the campaign.\n\nNate Oats\nOn March 27, 2019, Nate Oats was named Alabama's next head coach. Oats was previously the coach for the Buffalo Bulls, and had led them to three NCAA tournament appearances in the past four years. After a 16\u201315 record in his first season in 2019\u201320, Oats' second season brought Alabama the first SEC regular-season title since 2002 and the first SEC tournament title since 1991. The Tide were a No. 2 seed in the 2021 tournament, where they fell to UCLA in overtime in the Sweet Sixteen. Then in 2023, Oats coached Alabama to their second SEC regular season and tournament championship in three years. Alabama returned as the No. 1 overall seed in the 2023 NCAA tournament where they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the second time under Oats tenure before falling to San Diego State who advanced to the National Championship game.\nIn 2024, Alabama once again made the NCAA tournament and advanced to their second Elite Eight in program history after defeating North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen. Bama beat Clemson in the West Region finals to advance to the Final Four for the first time in program history. By the end of the 2024\u201325 season, Oats had led Alabama to two Sweet Sixteen finishes, one Elite Eight finish, and one Final Four, the most sustained runs of tournament success by the school.\nOats also holds the best record against AP top 10 teams in Alabama history.\n\nRoster\nArena\nThe Crimson Tide basketball team practices and plays in Coleman Coliseum, a multi-purpose arena on the UA campus in Tuscaloosa. The arena was built for $4.2 million and opened in 1968 as a replacement for the aging Foster Auditorium. In 2005, the building underwent a renovation in which more seats were added. The arena officially seats 15,314 people.\nColeman Coliseum was named for Jefferson Jackson Coleman, a prominent alumnus and longtime supporter of the University of Alabama. Until his death in 1995, he was the only person that had attended every Alabama football bowl game, starting with the Rose Bowl Game on January 1, 1926. Prior to 1990, the building was known as Memorial Coliseum.\n\nFan support\nMark's Madness\n\"Mark's Madness\" was a student organization named after former Crimson Tide coach Mark Gottfried, which is also a play on the nickname for the NCAA basketball tournament, \"March Madness\". It was created by a group of Alabama students in January 2000 in an attempt to create a more exciting atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum.  During the Gottfried era, the Crimson Tide was an impressive 137-27 (.835) in Coleman Coliseum. Mark's Madness was the largest student organization on campus during its time. The end of Mark Gottfried's tenure in early 2009 also meant the end of the Mark's Madness name.\n\nCrimson Chaos\nAfter Coach Anthony Grant was hired, a group of senior students approached the UA Marketing Department in the summer 2009 about resurrecting the student section organization. During the first exhibition game of the 2009 season, it was announced that the new name of the student organization for supporting Alabama basketball would be \"Crimson Chaos\".\nAs Crimson Chaos entered its second year, it officially registered as a University of Alabama student group and adopted a new format. In addition to supporting men's basketball, Crimson Chaos expanded to support all University of Alabama sports, becoming the official student group of athletics at the university. The group also tried new things to make the atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum as intimidating as it was in previous years, including adding the \"Roll Tide Roller Coaster\".  The newly energized environment Crimson Chaos created in Coleman Coliseum helped the Tide complete an undefeated season at home (for the 2010\u201311 season) with a 19\u20130 record, including wins over then #12 Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi State.\nThe group's popularity garnered even more attention and praise thanks to the late superfan Luke \u201cFluff\u201d Ratliff. He became the Crimson Chaos president and wore a plaid jacket to almost every game. He was loved by many for his light hearted humor and happy-go-lucky attitude. He inspired many people to follow and share in his passion for the tide hoops program and also other athletic teams around campus. He sparked the basketball program under Coach Nate Oats and continues to be an inspiration to so many. There is a plaque engraved to honor Fluff in the dedicated chair for all Crimson Chaos Presidents who come after him.\n\nPost-season results\nNCAA tournament\nAlabama has appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times. It has reached the Sweet Sixteen twelve times, the Elite Eight three times, and the Final Four once. Alabama has an overall NCAA tournament record of 32\u201326.\n\nNIT appearances\nAlabama has appeared in 16 National Invitation Tournaments, reaching the championship game on two occasions.

    "summary": "The Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team represents the University of Alabama in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The program plays in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Among SEC teams it trails only long-time basketball powerhouse Kentucky in SEC tournament titles, is third behind Kentucky and Tennessee in SEC regular season conference titles, and is fourth behind Kentucky, Texas, and Arkansas in total wins. Alabama was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1929\u201330 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. The team has appeared in the NCAA tournament 25 times, most recently in 2025, and has made ten Sweet Sixteens, three Elite Eights, and one Final Four in the tournament.  Alabama's current head coach is Nate Oats.\nThe men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach Wimp Sanderson and in the 1970s under coach C. M. Newton. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003. In the 2003\u201304 season, the team defeated #1-seeded Stanford in the NCAA tournament, and reached the Elite Eight round for the first time where they lost to the eventual national champion, Connecticut.\nUnder Nate Oats, the team earned SEC titles in 2021 and 2023. In the latter year, the Crimson Tide achieved their best-ever season in program history to that point, earning the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament. They fell to the eventual runner-up, San Diego State, in the Sweet Sixteen. In the 2024 NCAA tournament, they defeated #1-seeded North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen, and defeated #6-seeded Clemson in the Elite Eight to advance to their first Final Four appearance in the school's history where they lost to the eventual national champion, UConn.",

They have won eight conference championships (four WAC, and four Border Conference) and finished in the final AP rankings seven times. The highest national ranking the Sun Devils have achieved is AP No. 3 under Bobby Hurley during the 2017\u201318 season and No. 3 under Ned Wulk during the 1980\u201381 season when the starting lineup included future NBA stars Byron Scott, Fat Lever, and Alton Lister.\n38 ASU Sun Devils have been selected in the NBA draft, including eleven-time NBA All-Star James Harden, Byron Scott, Isaac Austin, Lafayette Lever, Alton Lister, Lionel Hollins, Sam Williams, Jeff Pendergraph, Mario Bennett, Tommy Smith, Ike Diogu, Eddie House, Freddie Lewis, and Joe Caldwell.\n\nHistory\nBobby Hurley era\nArizona State is currently led by head coach Bobby Hurley (eight seasons), who replaced Herb Sendek. Sendek was credited for bringing a \"basketball atmosphere\" and level of excitement to Arizona State that had been absent for years. In his first four seasons at Arizona State, Sendek led the Sun Devils to three consecutive 20 win seasons, the 2009 Pac-10 conference tournament finals, and the second round of the 2009 NCAA tournament and 2014 NCAA tournament. Hurley, in turn, has taken the Sun Devils to the 2018, 2019, and 2023 NCAA Tournaments. \nThe Sun Devils earned a 3-seed and first-round bye in the Pac-12 Conference men's basketball tournament and were scheduled to play Washington State when the tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was also canceled due to the pandemic. While the NCAA did not release seedings for the canceled tournament, the Sun Devils were projected by ESPN's Joe Lunardi in his end-of-season \"Bracketology\" to be a 9-seed. This would have been the first time since 1964 that the Sun Devils had made the tournament in three straight years.\n\nHead coaches\nRecord vs. Pac-12 opponents\nArizona State has the following all-time series records vs. Pac-12 opponents.

  "Arizona Wildcats": {
    "biography": "The Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. They compete in the Big 12 of NCAA Division I and are coached by Tommy Lloyd. Arizona previously spent 45 seasons in the Pac-10/12.\nThe program came to national prominence during the tenure of former head coach Lute Olson (1983\u22122007), who established the program as among America's elite in college basketball. One writer referred to U of A as \"Point Guard U\" because the school has produced successful guards like Steve Kerr, Damon Stoudamire, Khalid Reeves, Mike Bibby, Jason Terry, Gilbert Arenas, Jason Gardner, Jerryd Bayless, T. J. McConnell and Caleb Love, among others.\nFrom 1985 to 2009, the Arizona basketball team reached the NCAA Division I tournament for 25 consecutive years, tied for 3rd longest in NCAA history. Despite having their 1999 and 2008 appearances later vacated by the NCAA, the media still cites Arizona's streak, and simply notes the changes. The Wildcats have reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament on four occasions (1988, 1994, 1997, and 2001). They have also made two appearances in the National Championship (won over Kentucky Wildcats in 1997, lost to Duke Blue Devils in 2001). In Pac-10 play, former head coach Lute Olson currently holds the record for most wins as a Pac-10 coach with 327. In addition, the team has won 18 Pac-10/12 regular season championship titles and 9 Pac-10/12 tournament championship titles.  Arizona also holds the distinction of recording five out of the seven 17\u20131 Pac-10 seasons (one-loss seasons). In 2022 Arizona became the first team in conference history to win 18 conference games in a season.  No team has gone undefeated since the formation of the Pac-10/12.\nArizona ranks sixtenth all-time heading into the 2025\u201326 season with 1,913 wins and ranks seventh by winning percentage at (.657).  Arizona has spent 39 weeks at No. 1 in the AP Poll, which is ninth-most all-time; 30 weeks at No. 2, ninth most all-time; 174 weeks in the Top 5, seventh all-time; 347 weeks in the Top 10, sixth all-time; and 619 weeks in the top 25, seventh all-time.\n\nTeam history\nEarly years (1904\u22121925)\nThe University of Arizona fielded its first men's basketball team in 1904\u201305. Orin Albert Kates coached the team and drew opponents from local YMCAs. The first game Arizona played ended in a 40\u201332 victory over the Morenci YMCA.\nIn 1914, Arizona's first famous coach, James Fred \"Pop\" McKale was lured away from a teaching and coaching job at Tucson High School to take over as Athletic Director and coach basketball, football, baseball and track.  McKale took things to a new level, posting a 9\u20130 record his first season as a basketball coach.  Moreover, McKale elevated the program to intercollegiate play.  While basketball was his least favorite of the many sports he coached while at U of A, he chalked up three undefeated seasons and a career-winning average of .803, which has never been bested by a U of A coach who has held the post for at least three years.  The McKale Memorial Center, the main arena for Arizona basketball, is named in his honor.\n\nFred Enke (1925\u221261)\nFrom 1925 to 1961, the program was under the stewardship of Fred Enke, U of A's longest-tenured coach. Coach Fred A. Enke was responsible for the early successes of Wildcat basketball. Enke amassed 509 wins in his tenure on the U of A sidelines and still ranks as the second-winningest coach in school history, winning more than 60 percent of his games. Enke also led the Cats to the first four postseason appearances (3 N.I.T. and 1 NCAA) in school history and in 1950\u201351 competed in both the N.I.T. and NCAA postseason tournaments. Finally, he was the first coach to lead Arizona to a national ranking. Two of his teams (1950, 1951) finished the season ranked in the top 15.\nUnder Enke, U of A competed in the now-defunct Border Conference. Under Enke's direction, Arizona won 12 conference championships, including a span in which the Cats won or shared seven consecutive Border Conference titles (1942\u201351). No Border Conference team won as many league games (231) or overall contests (398) during its membership. In 1962, Arizona joined the Western Athletic Conference as a founding member after the Border Conference disbanded.\n\nBruce Larson (1961\u221271)\nBruce Larson, a player and assistant under Enke before coaching at Eastern Arizona and Weber State, coached the Wildcats from 1961 to 1971, leading the school to a 136\u2013148 record. Under his tenure, major planning began for a larger and more modern basketball arena (which would become McKale Center) to replace the outdated Bear Down Gymnasium. Larson would later serve as an analyst on Wildcat football and basketball telecasts during the Lute Olson (and Dick Tomey) era.\n\nFred Snowden (1973\u22121982)\nIn 1972, Fred Snowden was hired as the head basketball coach, making Arizona the second Division I school and the first major program to hire an African American head coach.  Known as \"The Fox\", Snowden brought the excitement back to Wildcat basketball during his 10 years on the Arizona sideline, averaging more than 80 points per game in six of his 10 years and topping the 100-point barrier 27 times.  Snowden led Arizona to the NCAA tournament twice, in 1976 and 1977, getting as far as the Elite Eight in 1976 before losing to UCLA 82\u201366, a game after defeating UNLV in a Sweet Sixteen matchup. During the 1976 tournament, he also logged Arizona's first and only tournament wins until Lute Olson's hiring, beating John Thompson's Georgetown team 83\u201376. Snowden's 1976 team also won the school's only WAC championship title on a buzzer-beater by Gilbert Myles verses New Mexico, with the help of the spectacular play of Bob Elliott, Jim Rappis, and Al Fleming. In 1978, Coach Snowden helped transition the basketball program over to the newly formed Pac-10. Snowden could not sustain success in the Pac-10, however, finishing no higher than 4th place in the conference. His 9\u201318 final season led U of A to look for a replacement.\nKnown for his high-octane offense and remembered as a trailblazer, Fred \"The Fox\" Snowden brought excitement to Arizona basketball during his 10-year tenure as the program's head coach. Snowden, who led the Wildcats from 1972 to 1982, was the first African-American head basketball coach at an NCAA Division I institution, amassing a 167\u2013108 mark. The 1973 Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, his career winning percentage of .607 has been topped by only three U of A coaches since 1924. Nicknamed \"The Fox\" due to his cool demeanor, Snowden led Arizona to three postseason berths, including the 1975 National Commissioners\u2019 Invitational Tournament and the 1976 and 1977 NCAA Tournaments. His best season came in 1976, when the Wildcats went 24\u20139, won the Western Athletic Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA West Regional Final. The Brewton, Ala., native was the head coach who led Arizona into the Pac-10 in the 1978\u201379 season, guiding the program for its first four seasons in the Conference. Snowden also oversaw the transition into the McKale Center after its opening in 1973. He was inducted into the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. Prior to his role at Arizona, Snowden was an assistant coach at Michigan. He also served on the coaching staff of his high school, Northwestern High School in Detroit, Mich., where he coached for five years after attending Wayne State University from 1954 to 1958. Snowden died in 1994 at the age of 57.\nAthletic Director Dave Strack brought in Ben Lindsey to replace Fred Snowden in 1983, and on the surface, it seemed like a reasonable move. Lindsey had junior college expertise, having had a successful career at Grand Canyon University, where he won two national titles.  What resulted, however, was nothing short of disaster. The 1983 team finished with the worst season in school history at 4\u201324, with only one Pac-10 win.\n\nLute Olson (1983\u22122007)\nOlson's First class and 1st Final Four\nNewly hired U of A Athletic director Cedric Dempsey fired Lindsey after only one season and hired University of Iowa coach Lute Olson as his successor.  U of A needed a coach with a history of quickly turning around programs, which Olson had done previously at Iowa.  \"I knew we had a tremendous amount of work to do\", Olson recalled in a recent interview with Tucson Lifestyle.  \"The program was in shambles at that point, after the terrible year before...\"\n\nUnder Olson, Arizona quickly rose to national prominence. Arizona won its first Pac-10 title in 1986, only three years after his arrival.  That season set up an amazing 1987\u201388 season, which included taking the Great Alaska Shootout championship, the Valley Bank Fiesta Bowl Classic championship and the Pac-10 championship.  Under players Steve Kerr, Kenny Lofton, and Sean Elliott, Arizona spent much of the season ranked No. 1 and made their first (and Olson's second) Final Four.  While Arizona lost in the Final Four round, their play put the program on the map and launched Arizona's reign as a perennial Pac-10 and NCAA tournament contender. Sean Elliott was awarded the John R. Wooden Award on the season and would set the PAC-10 scoring record.\n\nThe road to a first championship (1997)\nIn 1997, Arizona defeated the University of Kentucky, the defending national champions, to win the NCAA national championship. Prior to winning the championship in 1997, Arizona stormed back from 10-point deficits in the Southeast Regional First round and Second Round against #13 South Alabama and #12 College of Charleston, respectively winning 65\u201357 and 73\u201369. The Southeast Regional semifinal pitted Arizona against overall #1 Kansas (34\u20131) which had defeated Arizona the year before in the 1996 West Regional semifinal. However, Arizona came out fast and stunned the Jayhawks 85\u201382, then prevailed in overtime against Providence 96\u201392 in the Elite Eight to clinch a berth in the Final Four. Arizona then beat #1 seed North Carolina 66\u201358 in the Final Four, which turned out to be Dean Smith's last game as a coach. Arizona also accomplished the unprecedented feat of beating three number one seeds in the 1997 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. This feat has never been accomplished by another team.\n\nLater years and 1999 NCAA sanctions under Olson\nThe year following the Championship season, 1998, Arizona returned all 5 starters (Mike Bibby, Michael Dickerson, Miles Simon, Bennett Davison, and A. J. Bramlett) and were poised to make another run after receiving the #1 overall seed in the West, but were upset by Utah in the Elite 8.\nIn 1999, all 5 starters were lost to graduation or early entry to the NBA draft and Arizona's hopes of continuing its streak of consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament was in jeopardy until senior point guard Jason Terry (the 6th man the previous two seasons) elevated his game (receiving National Player of the Year honors) and continued the school's amazing streak.\nIn 2000, former Wildcat Jason Terry, stated that he received approximately $4,500 in cash, checks and wire transfers from New York sports agent Larry Fox, after his junior season. The NCAA announced that as a result a one-game 1999 NCAA tournament appearance was formally vacated. In addition, Arizona asked Terry to repay the $45,363 in forfeited NCAA 1999 tournament revenue and banned him from the U of A Sports Hall of Fame, including a provision that his jersey would not be retired. Terry's jersey was later retired in 2015.\n\nNCAA Finalist (2001)\n2001 was one of the most challenging and rewarding years for the program. Lute Olson's wife Bobbi, well known to players and fans alike as a steadfast presence on the sidelines, died of cancer. The team, which had been a preseason pick by many to win the national title had to play without Olson for three weeks while Olson was on bereavement leave. The Cats vowed to dedicate their season to Bobbi. With guard Jason Gardner, center Loren Woods and forward Michael Wright \u2014 each an All-American \u2014 leading the way, the Cats trounced their opponents, beating Oregon 104\u201365, devastating USC 105\u201361, and charging through the Final Four. They took down Eastern Illinois, Butler, Mississippi, Illinois, and Michigan State, only to be stopped by Duke in the title game. While being considered the favorite to win the title, which would have been Coach Olson's 2nd and tied him with Coach Mike Krzyzewski, his opponent, the Blue Devils claimed a ten-point victory in the game. This is the last game Coach Olson ever coached in the Final Four and is considered by fans of the program to be his most bitter defeat. A championship would have vaulted him into hallowed ground among coaches, being one of few with multiple titles. Instead he remains tied with many coaches who have a single championship ring to their name. Meanwhile, his opponent in that game now is in second place among college coaches with five championship rings, behind only John Wooden's ten. All five of Krzyzewski's titles came in the 64 team field era; Wooden none. Still Coach Olson earned the respect of his contemporary, Coach K said in the post-game interview that \"Arizona had a great team and an amazing season and was worthy of winning the championship, let's give a hand to Coach Olson and his team.\" The comment drew rousing applause from the audience in attendance and made Coach Olson proud, even in defeat, to be honored as an equal by Coach Krzyzewski who many claim is the best coach in college history.\n\nLater years and Further NCAA sanctions under Olson (2002\u22122008)\nIn his later years at U of A, Olson fielded competitive teams with extremely talented point guards. Continuing the reputation and nickname \"Point Guard U,\" recent standouts include Jason Gardner, Salim Stoudamire, Mustafa Shakur, Jerryd Bayless and Nic Wise. Arizona would win Olson's last Pac-10 title during the 2004\u20132005 season under the spectacular play of seniors Salim Stoudamire and center Channing Frye. That team also made it to the Elite 8 and the verge of the Final Four before blowing a 15-point lead with four minutes to play and losing in overtime, 90\u201389, to the No. 1 seed and eventual national runner-up, University of Illinois.\nOlson took an unexplained leave of absence at the beginning of the 2007\u20132008 season. Assistant coach Kevin O'Neill took over interim head coaching duties for the Arizona Wildcats. At that time, Olson announced that he intended to be back for the 2008\u201309 season and finish out his contract, which was scheduled to end in 2011. His departure was criticized by some members of the media. They also questioned how he and the U of A athletic department handled his return and the verbal succession agreement with coach O'Neill. However, on October 23, 2008, he unexpectedly announced his retirement from the program (by way of an announcement from Arizona athletic director Jim Livengood).  A few days later, Olson's personal physician held a press conference and explained that the retirement was strongly advised due to health concerns.\nAfter Lute Olson's abrupt retirement, Arizona Athletic Director Jim Livengood appointed assistant coach Russ Pennell as the interim head coach for the 2008\u20132009 season 23 days before the start of the season.  The appointment came after Mike Dunlap, the associate head coach brought in to replace Kevin O'Neill, turned down the job. Under Pennell, the Cats finished 19\u201313 in the regular season, including a non-conference win over Kansas and a 7-game win streak with wins over UCLA and Washington. Despite a 19\u201313 finish to the season, Arizona was controversially selected as one of the last teams into the field of 65 as a 12th seed in the Midwest region, extending its NCAA consecutive tournament appearances to 25 years.  The Cats made it to the Sweet 16 (regional semi-finals) with wins over 5-seed Utah and 13-seed Cleveland State, before falling to overall 1-seed, Louisville.  Despite Pennell's post-season success, he was not retained, as Arizona announced before his hiring they would hold a national coaching search after the season ended. (On April 9, 2009, Pennell was hired as head coach of the men's basketball team at Division II Grand Canyon University, a member of the Pacific West Conference.)\nFollowing Olson's retirement, reports of NCAA violations arose regarding payment of impermissible benefits to players and recruiting violations. In response, Arizona self-imposed sanctions that included a reduction in the number of recruiting visits by coaches and prospective players, the disbanding of a booster group, and implementation of a series of administrative and rules changes to prevent further violations. The NCAA upheld most of those self-imposed sanctions but determined the school had used two ineligible players in 2007-08 and would have to vacate all wins involving those players and eliminate their statistics. The NCAA reduced the number of scholarships and visits with recruits Arizona was allowed to make. The NCAA found that Olson failed to promote an atmosphere of compliance at the university but decided against sanctioning the coach because he was retired and had health issues. \"I think that was my fault,\" Olson said during a 2008 interview with ESPN.com. \"That wasn't anyone else's fault. It was my error and it was a big error. But I guess in 26 years you are allowed to make a mistake once in a while anyway and that's not to say I haven't made a lot of them but in terms of that, that was a big mistake on my part.\"\n\nSean Miller (2009\u22122021)\nAfter the end of the season, various coaching names were considered to succeed Lute Olson on a permanent basis. Arizona was perceived to have interest in Gonzaga's Mark Few, Pittsburgh's Jamie Dixon and then-Memphis coach John Calipari (before he accepted the vacant position at Kentucky) to take the job. Arizona even brought USC's Tim Floyd on campus for an interview and while Arizona claims no formal offer was ever presented, Floyd ultimately turned down the job publicly.\n\nFirst season (2009\u221210)\nArizona hired Sean Miller from Xavier University to fill the head coaching position. He initially turned the job down before changing his mind and accepting the job on Apr. 6, 2009 despite having never visited the Arizona campus. Miller was formally introduced as the 13th head men's basketball coach at Arizona at a press conference on April 7, 2009, at McKale Center.  At the press conference, Miller acknowledged Lute Olson's impact on the Arizona program by addressing Olson personally: \"One of the reasons I sit here today is because of the great legacy you built.\" Miller also promised U of A fans that they would enjoy the style of both offense and defense he would bring to Wildcat basketball. Miller's salary is $1.6 million per year; he will receive an additional $400,000 per season from Nike and media contracts during a five-year deal, as well as a $1 million signing bonus and other amenities such as season tickets to other Wildcat sporting events and the use of a private jet. Within three months of joining the program, Miller compiled a strong five-player recruiting class that ranked 13th nationally in 2009. After going 16\u201315 and missing the NCAA tournament for the first time in 25 years during Miller's initial 2009\u201310 campaign.\n\nThree Elite Eights under Miller (2011, 2014\u221215)\nIn his second season as the head coach at Arizona, the Cats finished the season with 30\u20138, 14\u20134 Pac-12 play, behind the play of sophomore Pac-10 Player of the Year Derrick Williams.  It would be the Wildcats' first outright Pac-10 regular season title (its 12th overall), 4th 30+ win season (1st overall) and Elite Eight appearance (8th overall) since the 2004\u20132005 season. In addition, Miller led the Wildcats to their first unbeaten home record (17\u20130) in 14 years and was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year. This was the first time an Arizona coach received this honor since Lute Olson in 2003. The 17 wins without a loss at home is tied for the second-most in school history. Miller would add to the season's success by guiding the Cats to their first Elite Eight appearance since the 2004\u20132005 Season as a 5-seed. In the second round, Arizona secured a 2-point victory over 12th seeded Memphis (coached by former Wildcat (and member of the 1997 national title team) Josh Pastner) with a blocked shot in the final seconds by Derrick Williams. Arizona would follow with another close game\u2014a controversial one-point win against 4-seed Texas. In the Sweet-16 match-up, Arizona found itself pitted against top-seeded Duke, the first time since the 2001 title game that the two schools had met. Duke would extend an early lead, but 25 points from Derrick Williams kept the Cats in the game and down by 6 points at the half. In the second half, Williams' teammates picked up the slack, dominating the Blue Devils by scoring 55 second-half points and routing the defending champs 93\u201377.

Three former Wildcats who played under Lute Olson \u2013 Damon Stoudamire (head coach at the University of the Pacific), Miles Simon (assistant for the Los Angeles Lakers), and Josh Pastner (head coach at Georgia Tech), as well as Arkansas' Eric Musselman, were under speculation to take the job.

Their current streak of weeks ranked in the AP Poll is at 3 weeks.\nThe Associated Press began its basketball poll on January 20, 1949. The following is a summary of those annual polls. Starting in the 1961\u201362 season, AP provided a preseason (PS) poll. AP did a post-tournament poll in 1953, 1954, 1974 and 1975. The following table summarizes Arizona history in the AP Poll:  The Wildcats longest streak of weeks ranked inside the AP Top 25 poll is 141 weeks, starting with the 1988 pre-season poll and ended with the March 13, 1995 poll.  The 141 weeks is 12th most all-time.  Arizona was ranked in 324 out of 326 polls from 1988 until 2005, which is more than any school during the same time frame.\n\nRanked in 40 out of 75 seasons (53%)\n\nRecord vs. Big-12 opponents\nThe Arizona Wildcats lead the all-time series regardless of conference affiliation vs. eight other Big 12 opponents, trailing only Houston, Kansas, Kansas State and Texas Tech.\n\nTotal (323\u2013224, .590)\nNote all-time series includes non-conference matchups.\n\nPast Record vs. Pac-12 opponents\nThe Arizona Wildcats lead the all-time series regardless of conference affiliation vs. ten other Pac-12 opponents, trailing only UCLA.\n\nTotal (764\u2013421, .645)\nNote all-time series includes non-conference matchups & Pac-12 Tournament.\n\nConference records\nNote:\u2020 30 Pac-12 wins vacated due to NCAA infractions. Pac-12 record is 173\u201369 (.715).\n\nGame day traditions\nArizona's home games include many traditions involving The Pride of Arizona pep band and the Zona Zoo.\n\nBefore every game, the band splits into four sections in the four sides of McKale Center. They play Bear Down Arizona in sequence before the band runs back to the student section in the north stands and plays all of Bear Down. The band also yells \"Hi fans!\" to the fans, who respond by yelling \"Hi band!\" and \"Hi Tommy!\" to head coach Tommy Lloyd, who responds by waving to the band.\nWhile the opposing team's players are being introduced, the student section turns their backs to the court. As each player's name is announced, they will yell \"Sucks!\" In the interest of sportsmanship, though, the Athletic Department is attempting to phase this tradition out.\nAt the start of each half, the entire crowd will stand until the other team scores a point. The fans will also clap rhythmically with the band as it plays a four-note refrain repeatedly until the ball is tipped or inbounded.\nWhen an opposing player fouls an Arizona player, the band and students chant, while pointing at the opposing player, \"You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! On you, that's who!\" If the foul occurs during a shot and the player makes the shot, the chant is instead \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! Don't touch me!\"\nIf an opposing player accrues four fouls during the game, they will chant \"Four!\" four times while waving four fingers. If a player fouls out, the band plays the beat from \"Another One Bites the Dust\", concluding with the band and students yelling \"Hey! We're gonna get you too!\"\nWhen opposing players are attempting foul shots, besides attempting to distract the player, the band and students have several chants, but the only constant one is yelled if the player misses their first shot of a two-shot foul, in which case they yell \"Nice shot, buddy!\"\nIf Arizona is beating an opponent by a comfortable margin late in the game, the band and students will chant \"Go start the bus!\" repeatedly. If an opponent makes a big play, they will chant \"It just doesn't matter!\"\nBeginning in the 1980s, the \"Ooh Aah Man,\" Joe Cavaleri, made regular appearances at McKale to pump up the crowd. He would start by spelling out \"A-R-I-Z-O-N-A!\" with his body as the crowd chanted along. He would then direct the crowd in chanting \"U of A!\", first by each side of the arena, then by the north and south sides and east and west sides simultaneously then by the whole arena. His routine usually involved pulling off his shirt and pants to reveal another Arizona shirt and shorts underneath. Cavaleri was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2010 and only made a few appearances during the 2010\u20132011 season; he officially retired from his \"superfan\" duties in 2013.\nAt the end of every home game (and every Arizona athletics event the band is present at) the band plays Arizona's alma mater, \"All Hail, Arizona!\" Students and fans link arms, sway as they sing and jump up and down while singing the last part of the song.\nFor a time during the Sean Miller era, the team hosted an annual \"White Out\" game. All fans were encouraged to wear white T-shirts. The most recent white out game was on December 7, 2013, versus UNLV. This was the fourth consecutive season to include a white out game. The tradition has not continued under Tommy Lloyd (the Arizona women's basketball program has continued to have white out games at McKale Center under coach Adia Barnes).\n\nFacilities\nBeardown Gym\nPrior to playing its games at the McKale Center, Arizona played games at Bear Down Gym from 1927 until 1973. Arizona would win its inaugural game against Arizona State, then known as Tempe State Teachers College by a score of 29\u201318.\n\nMcKale Center\nArizona is currently plays its home games at McKale Center, a 14,688 seat multi-purpose arena located at Tucson, Arizona, that opened in 1973. The McKale Center is the fifth different home site in program history.\nAt McKale Center, Arizona enjoys one of the nation's best home court advantages.  The Wildcats have compiled a 651\u2013121 (an .847 winning percentage) record since moving to the McKale Center permanently.  Through the 2023\u201324 season, McKale Center has hosted 10,154,639 fans for Arizona home games and the Wildcats have averaged 13,035 fans (better than 95% capacity) per game during that time. The 2014\u20132015 season marked the highest average attendance in McKale Center history with an average 14,591 (100% capacity) Wildcats fans at each home game.\n\nRadio network affiliates\nThe current flagship radio station for men's basketball is Tucson sports radio station KCUB, branded as \u201cWildcats Radio 1290\u201d. From 1983 until 2004, the flagship station was news/talk radio station KNST. The primary play-by-play voice of Wildcat football, baseball and men's basketball, since 1987, is Brian Jeffries (after starting out as the color commentator for former CBS Sports announcer Ray Scott, who called Wildcats games from 1984 through the spring of 1987).\nThe Phoenix radio affiliate for Arizona Wildcats football and men's basketball is KGME, branded as \"Fox Sports 910.\"\n\nSee also\nList of NCAA Division I Men's Final Four appearances by coach\nNCAA Division I Men's Final Four appearances by school\nNCAA Division I men's basketball tournament consecutive appearances\nArizona Wildcats women's basketball\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",
    "summary": "The Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. They compete in the Big 12 of NCAA Division I and are coached by Tommy Lloyd. Arizona previously spent 45 seasons in the Pac-10/12.\nThe program came to national prominence during the tenure of former head coach Lute Olson (1983\u22122007), who established the program as among America's elite in college basketball. One writer referred to U of A as \"Point Guard U\" because the school has produced successful guards like Steve Kerr, Damon Stoudamire, Khalid Reeves, Mike Bibby, Jason Terry, Gilbert Arenas, Jason Gardner, Jerryd Bayless, T. J. McConnell and Caleb Love, among others.\nFrom 1985 to 2009, the Arizona basketball team reached the NCAA Division I tournament for 25 consecutive years, tied for 3rd longest in NCAA history. Despite having their 1999 and 2008 appearances later vacated by the NCAA, the media still cites Arizona's streak, and simply notes the changes. The Wildcats have reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament on four occasions (1988, 1994, 1997, and 2001). They have also made two appearances in the National Championship (won over Kentucky Wildcats in 1997, lost to Duke Blue Devils in 2001). In Pac-10 play, former head coach Lute Olson currently holds the record for most wins as a Pac-10 coach with 327. In addition, the team has won 18 Pac-10/12 regular season championship titles and 9 Pac-10/12 tournament championship titles.  Arizona also holds the distinction of recording five out of the seven 17\u20131 Pac-10 seasons (one-loss seasons). In 2022 Arizona became the first team in conference history to win 18 conference games in a season.  No team has gone undefeated since the formation of the Pac-10/12.\nArizona ranks sixtenth all-time heading into the 2025\u201326 season with 1,913 wins and ranks seventh by winning percentage at (.657).  Arizona has spent 39 weeks at No. 1 in the AP Poll, which is ninth-most all-time; 30 weeks at No. 2, ninth most all-time; 174 weeks in the Top 5, seventh all-time; 347 weeks in the Top 10, sixth all-time; and 619 weeks in the top 25, seventh all-time.",

    "biography": "The Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team, colloquially known as the Hogs, represents the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. The team competes in the Southeastern Conference and is coached by John Calipari. Arkansas plays its home games in Bud Walton Arena on the University of Arkansas campus. The Razorbacks are a top-twenty-five program all-time by winning percentage (.641), top-twenty program by NCAA tournament games played, top-twenty program by NCAA Tournament games won, top-fifteen program by Final Four appearances, and despite playing significantly fewer seasons than most programs in major conferences, top-thirty by all-time wins. Under the coaching leadership of Nolan Richardson, the Hogs won the national championship in 1994, defeating Duke, and appeared in the championship game the following year, finishing as runner-up to UCLA. The Razorbacks have made six NCAA Final Four appearances (1941, 1945, 1978, 1990, 1994, and 1995).\n\nHistory\nEarly success under Schmidt (1923\u201329)\nArkansas had a relatively late start in basketball; it did not field its first team until 1923. Francis Schmidt coached the Razorbacks from the 1923\u201324 season until the 1928\u201329 season, while also coaching the football and baseball teams.\n\nSchmidt oversaw the construction of the gymnasium that was home to the Razorbacks from the inaugural season through the 1936\u201337 season. The project was headed by Schmidt and Jay Fulbright (father of future United States Senator from Arkansas, J. William Fulbright). Schmidt and Fulbright organized a group of businessmen that facilitated the transfer of a former car showroom to the university to serve as the gym for the Razorbacks. The wooden gym, made out of surplus World War I material and officially named Schmidt Gymnasium, became known as \"Schmidt's barn,\" in reference to its makeshift nature and lack of accommodations.\nAfter a difficult first year that resulted in a 17\u201311 overall record and a 3\u20139 conference record, Schmidt quickly led the Hogs to success and a dominating run in the Southwest Conference during his tenure. Building off the program's first season, the 1924\u201325 team finished third in the conference, quickly turning their record around to 9\u20133 in conference play. This second season laid the groundwork for tremendous success with Schmidt, as the Razorbacks won the conference championship outright in just the third year of the program's existence with a record of 23\u20132 (11\u20131). The 1925\u201326 season kicked off a string of four straight Southwest Conference championships under Schmidt, and five straight overall. Schmidt also coached the Hogs to the first of three perfect SWC seasons in program history in 1927\u201328, with a conference record of 12\u20130 and a 15.25-point average margin of victory in conference play. The 1927\u201328 season also marked the beginning of a school record 31-game winning streak that ran until the last few games of the next season. Schmidt's last four teams at Arkansas went a combined 75\u20136 (42\u20134).\nThe last couple years of Schmidt's dominant SWC run were marked by serious star power, with future Razorback basketball coaches Eugene Lambert Sr. and Glen Rose earning First-Team Helms Athletic Foundation All-American recognition during Schmidt's last two seasons (1928\u201329 and 1927\u201328, respectively), along with Tom Pickel earning First-Team honors from College Humor Magazine in Schmidt's final season as coach. Schmidt's Razorbacks had four of the five All-SWC selections in 1928 (Rose, Pickel, Lambert, and Wear Schoonover). During Schmidt's time at Arkansas, the Razorbacks finished first in the SWC four out of six years, and compiled an overall record of 113\u201322 (.837), the highest winning percentage of any Arkansas coach ever. Schmidt left Arkansas to take the football and basketball jobs at TCU, where he was coach until 1934.\n\nBassett years (1929\u201333)\nIn the 1929\u201330 season, Charles Bassett took over as head coach, leaving the head coaching job at Texas A&M that he held for two years without finding much success, going a paltry 16\u201318 (5\u201315) in his two years as head coach in College Station, including a last-place finish in conference play for the 1927\u201328 Southwest Conference season. Arkansas's success under Bassett was limited to his first season as coach, when the Hogs won the Southwest Conference Championship with multi-sport star and current College Football Hall of Fame member Wear Schoonover garnering Second-Team All-American recognition from College Humor and earning First-Team All-SWC honors for the third straight season. The Razorbacks did not finish above third place in the Southwest Conference standings for the rest of Bassett's tenure. Aside from the SWC Championship in 1930, the other major bright spot in Bassett's tenure came on January 8, 1931, when the Razorbacks defeated rival Texas, 29\u201321, the day UT dedicated its new gym. Bassett's last season was the 1932\u201333 season, when the Razorbacks went 14\u20137 overall with a 6\u20136 conference record, the first time since the inaugural 1923\u201324 season that the Hogs did not finish the year with a winning record in conference play. After four seasons, Bassett's overall record was 62\u201329 (.681).\n\nFirst Glen Rose era (1933\u201342)\nGlen Rose took over in the 1933\u201334 season and returned the program to a competitive position within the SWC. Named a Helms Athletic Foundation First-Team All-American as a Hog in 1928, Rose was the first former player to coach the Razorbacks. Rebuilding the program after the decline under Bassett, Rose's first season as coach produced a .500 conference record (6\u20136) and a tie for third place in the final SWC standings. The Hogs finished with a winning conference record and no lower than second place in the conference standings for the rest of Rose's first stint with Arkansas, save for one season.\nThe 1935\u201336 season ended with the Hogs competing for the right to represent the United States in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin for the first year of basketball being an official medal sport. The Razorbacks swept the other NCAA teams they played in the NCAA Olympic Playoffs, but lost in the first round of the U.S. Olympic Trials to the Universal Pictures Amateur Athletic Union team that went on to win the gold medal.\nThe following season, 1936\u201337 featured the last game in Schmidt Gymnasium, or \"Schmidt's barn.\" Construction of the new building, (originally known as the Field House) that came to be known as the Men's Gymnasium was under way in 1936, and was completed in the fall semester of 1937, with a capacity of 2,500. The new home for the Razorbacks was dedicated on February 4, 1938, in a 53\u201326 win over TCU. The Men's Gymnasium served as home for the basketball team until Barnhill Arena was completed in 1954 and the Razorbacks began playing games there in the 1955\u201356 season.\nThe Razorbacks won the Southwest Conference outright three times and tied for first two more times during this nine-year run. In the 1940\u201341 season, Rose led Arkansas to its second perfect conference record ever (12\u20130) en route the NCAA Final Four in the Razorbacks' first NCAA Tournament appearance. The 1940\u201341 season is also notable for the outstanding play of John \"Johnny\" Adams, a Helms First-Team All-American who is credited as being one of the players responsible for the proliferation of the jump shot in basketball. Adams set the single-game SWC scoring record that season with 36 points against TCU in Fort Worth on February 21, 1941. Rose finished this nine-year run with a record of 154\u201347 (.766). Rose went on to coach the football team for the 1944 and 1945 seasons, without much success. Rose returned to coach the basketball team a decade after he left.\n\nEugene Lambert (1942\u201349)\nFormer Razorback and All-American Eugene Lambert took the coaching job starting in the 1942\u201343 season. Lambert found moderate success in his first season as head coach, posting a winning record and overseeing a first in program history by coaching the first freshman to play for the Razorback varsity squad, Paul Coleman. After winning a share of the Southwest Conference Championship for the 1943\u201344 season, Lambert and Arkansas were selected for the NCAA tournament for the second time in program history. However, the team was forced to withdraw after tragedy struck when a car accident injured two of their starters, Ben Jones and Deno Nichols, and killed Eugene Norris, a physical education teacher that accompanied the players on their trip. The next year the Hogs earned another tournament berth and advanced to the Final Four, losing to eventual champions Oklahoma A&M. The Razorbacks did not make the tournament again until the 1948\u201349 season, when the Hogs shared the SWC crown with Baylor and Rice. The Hogs lost in the first round of the regional, but won the third place game. The 1948\u201349 season was Lambert's last season coaching the Hogs. During Lambert's seven seasons, Arkansas won a share the Southwest Conference Championship twice, with three second-place finishes and never fell lower than third in the conference. Lambert's final record was 113\u201360 (.653).\n\nPresley Askew (1949\u201352)\nPresley Askew took over for the 1949\u201350 season and coached through the 1951\u201352 season. Arkansas tied for first place in the Southwest Conference in Askew's first season, but bottomed out in his third and final season, posting the program's first losing record of 10\u201314 (4\u20138). The Razorbacks did not make the NCAA Tournament during Askew's tenure. Askew's overall record was 35\u201337 (.486), the first basketball coach to finish his career at Arkansas with a losing record, despite having a winning conference record of 19\u201317. As of 2025, Askew's three-season tenure is the shortest in Razorback basketball history of non-interim head coaches that coached at least one game.\n\nSecond Glen Rose era (1952\u201366)\nGlen Rose returned for the 1952\u201353 season; his second stint with the Hogs lasted until 1966. Rose did not reach the heights of his previous run, with the only real success being in the 1957\u201358 season, when Arkansas tied for first place in the Southwest Conference with SMU and made the NCAA tournament, losing to an Oklahoma State team whose starting point guard, Eddie Sutton, eventually became head coach of the Razorbacks. Rose's teams in his second spell as head coach posted a winning conference record only five times, to go along with six losing records overall.\nFor the second time in his career as head coach, Rose oversaw a transition from one home court to another. Eighteen years after the transition from \"Schmidt's barn\" to the Men's Gymnasium, the Razorbacks began playing their home games in Barnhill Arena (then known as Razorback Fieldhouse) in the 1955\u201356 season. With a capacity of 3,500 at the time of the first game, the transition to Razorback Fieldhouse represented more investment and interest in the program, even if the results of Rose's second run with the Hogs were lackluster. The capacity of Razorback Fieldhouse was 5,000 once it was fully completed and remained at that number until 1977. Razorback Fieldhouse would also be the site of the first televised home game for the Hogs, with Rose coaching the Hogs to a 61\u201357 victory over Texas Tech on January 3, 1959.\nRose finished his second run with the Hogs (fourteen seasons) with a record of 171\u2013154 (.526). Rose's overall record for his time at Arkansas (twenty-three seasons) was 325\u2013201 (.618). Rose's twenty-three seasons as head coach remain the longest tenure of any Razorback basketball coach, and his fourteen continuous seasons as coach from 1952 to 1966 is second only to Nolan Richardson for longest continuous tenure as Razorback basketball coach.\n\nDecline under Waller and Van Eman (1966\u201374)\nAfter Glen Rose's teams continually failed to be competitive in the SWC during his second stint as coach, he retired following the 1965\u201366 season. The next eight years proved to be much worse than the lows experienced under Rose's leadership.\nDuddy Waller became head coach for the 1966\u201367 season, but only lasted until the 1970\u201371 season. All of Waller's teams posted losing records, including two of the three worst winning percentages for a season in school history and the second most losses in a season in school history. Waller's record during his four seasons was 31\u201364, which is the worst overall winning percentage (.326) of any Arkansas basketball coach ever.\nWaller was replaced by Lanny Van Eman, who coached the Hogs from the 1970\u201371 season through the 1973\u201374 season. Van Eman started his career as head coach of the Razorbacks with the worst season in school history, a 5\u201321 (1\u201313) campaign that still holds the record for most losses in a season, lowest winning percentage for a season, most SWC losses in a season, and fewest conference wins in a season. Despite such an awful first season, Van Eman did manage to lead Arkansas to its first winning conference record in a decade, when the Hogs finished with a 9\u20135 record in the SWC for the 1972\u201373 season and tied for second place in the conference. Van Eman finished his career at Arkansas with a 39\u201365 record (.375).\n\nDespite the major shortcomings of Waller and Van Eman's teams on the court, of note is the fact that these coaches oversaw the gradual integration of African-American players into the basketball program under their leadership. Thomas A. Johnson was the first African-American to play for the Razorbacks on the 1967 team headed by Waller. Following in the footsteps of Johnson were the first African-American stars of Razorback basketball, guard Martin Terry and center Dean Tolson. Playing under Van Eman, Terry and Tolson put up huge numbers and set school records that still stand today, while also collecting All-SWC and All-American recognition. Terry owns the Arkansas records for highest season and career scoring averages, was a two-time First-Team All-SWC selection in 1972 and 1973, and picked up an All-American Honorable Mention nod from Helms in 1973, the same season he was named Southwest Conference Player of the Year. He was taken in the third round of the 1973 NBA draft, the second-highest pick in Arkansas history at the time. Tolson is the school record holder for single-game field goals made and attempted, as well as career rebounding average. Tolson would follow Terry and get drafted in the fifth round of the 1974 NBA draft.\nArkansas failed to finish above second place in the Southwest Conference during these eight seasons, posting a winning record only once, and did not receive any invitations to the NCAA Tournament. The combined overall record of these two coaches was 70\u2013129 (.352) and 39\u201373 (.348) in conference play.\n\nNew heights in the Eddie Sutton era (1974\u201385)\nAfter coaching at Creighton for five mostly unremarkable seasons that culminated in an NCAA Tournament bid and a first round victory, Eddie Sutton found himself on Frank Broyles's radar, as the longtime head football coach and new athletic director wanted to invest in the basketball program to get it out of the depths of the Waller and Van Eman years.\nBroyles hired Sutton starting with the 1974\u201375 season, and the hire proved to be a turning point in the program's history. Sutton's first campaign with the Hogs turned out to be a mildly successful one that put fans on notice, with an 11\u20133 conference record that was good for second place in the SWC, as high as the program had finished in conference play in seventeen years. Sutton's second team did not perform as strongly in conference play, but improved its overall record. The excitement behind Razorback basketball was palpable as renovations began on what was then officially Barnhill Arena after it was renamed in 1973 for former athletic director and head football coach, John Barnhill. Sutton's second team also had the core players that would elevate the Razorbacks to a national power under his leadership, the famed in-state players known as the \"Triplets,\" Ron Brewer, Marvin Delph, and Sidney Moncrief (who later became the first player in program history to have his number retired).\n\n \nThe 1976\u201377 Razorbacks were the team that established Arkansas as a basketball power in the modern era. Beginning play in a renovated Barnhill Arena with an expanded capacity of 6,200, the Hogs won the SWC with a perfect 16\u20130 conference record, going 26\u20131 overall in the regular season and spent more weeks in the AP Poll that season than every season prior, combined, with a peak ranking of #6. The Hogs earned their first tournament invitation in nearly two decades, but fell in the first round, while still finishing ranked in the AP Poll for the first time in school history. The Hogs would follow the 1976\u201377 season with Sutton's most successful season at Arkansas and one of the best seasons in school history. Barnhill Arena was expanded further prior to the 1977\u201378 season, this time to a capacity of 9,000. The Hogs started the season ranked #7 by the AP Poll, and lived up to the high expectations of their recent success by winning their first fourteen games and never falling out of the top ten of the AP Poll the whole season. Arkansas ascended to the top spot in the AP Poll for the first time in program history on February 13, 1978. The Hogs received an at-large bid to the tournament after winning a share of the SWC Championship and beat AP #2 UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to eventual champion, Kentucky, in the Final Four in St. Louis. The fifth-ranked Hogs won the third place game against AP #6 Notre Dame, 71\u201369.\nSutton's 1978\u201379 team still managed a great campaign, despite the loss of two of the \"Triplets,\" All-American Brewer and Delph. Repeating with a share of the Southwest Conference crown, the Hogs won the SWC Tournament to clinch the bid to the tournament. The Razorbacks advanced to the Elite Eight, where they lost a close game marred by a controversial last-minute missed tripping call to Larry Bird and undefeated Indiana State, 73\u201371.\nWhile Sutton's other teams would not be as high achieving as the 1977\u201378 and 1978\u201379 squads, he would still coach the Razorbacks to successful seasons, never finishing lower than second in the Southwest Conference standings after his second season, while also producing highlights ranging from U.S. Reed's game-winning, last-second half court shot against defending champions Louisville in the second round of the 1981 NCAA Tournament, ending back-to-back national runner-up Houston's thirty-nine game SWC winning streak, having a player drafted in the first round of the NBA draft three straight years from 1983 to 1985 (Darrell Walker, Alvin Robertson, and Joe Kleine), and the Razorbacks' first win over an AP #1 team against Michael Jordan and North Carolina in Pine Bluff, Arkansas on February 12, 1984.\nSutton's eleven seasons remain the third longest tenure in Razorback basketball history. During these eleven seasons, Arkansas won or shared the Southwest Conference Championship four times. The Hogs finished ranked seven times, including four top-ten finishes and two top-five finishes. The Razorbacks were invited to the NCAA Tournament during each of the last nine seasons of Sutton's tenure. Sutton finished with a 260\u201375 (.776) overall record at Arkansas, including nine NCAA Tournament appearances, four Sweet Sixteen appearances, two Elite Eight appearances, and one Final Four berth.\n\nNolan Richardson era and a national championship (1985\u20132002)\nTulsa coach and former Texas Western player Nolan Richardson replaced Sutton beginning with the 1985\u201386 season. After two years without a winning conference record, Arkansas finished tied for second in the Southwest Conference standings in Richardson's third season. The Razorbacks won the SWC regular season and tournament titles each of its last three seasons in the SWC (1989, 1990, and 1991). \nArkansas joined the Southeastern Conference for the 1991\u201392 season and won the regular season conference championship in 1992 and 1994, also winning the SEC Western Division title in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995. The Razorbacks also won the 2000 SEC tournament. Arkansas made the NCAA Tournament thirteen times during Richardson's seventeen seasons, and made the Final Four during the 1990, 1994 and 1995 seasons. They won their first national championship in 1994 by beating Duke in the title game. The next season, they returned to the championship game and finished as runner-up, losing to UCLA. \nRichardson was fired in 2002 after making controversial public statements against the university and then-athletic director Frank Broyles. Assistant coach Mike Anderson coached the rest of the season, going 1\u20131. Richardson holds the school record for most wins by a head coach, with an overall record of 389\u2013169 (.697). Coach Richardson led Arkansas to four NCAA Tournament Elite Eight appearances (1990, 1991, 1994 and 1995) and six NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen appearances (1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996). Between the 1989\u201390 and 1995\u201396 seasons, Arkansas won more games than any other school in the nation.\n\nThe Stan Heath era (2002\u201307)\nStan Heath coached the Hogs beginning with the 2002\u201303 season and remained in Fayetteville through the 2006\u201307 season. During Heath's five seasons, the Razorbacks did not enjoy the success that they achieved under Richardson. They never finished higher than third place in the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference. They were invited to the NCAA Tournament in Heath's final two seasons, although they were eliminated in the Round of 64 each trip. Heath's overall record at Arkansas was 82\u201371 (.536) with a record of 31\u201349 (.388) in SEC play. Despite racking up 20 wins and his second consecutive NCAA tournament appearance in his final year of coaching the Razorbacks, Heath was fired after the 2006\u201307 season.\n\nDana Altman Day (April 2, 2007)\nCreighton University head coach, Dana Altman was hired as the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks on April 2, 2007. During his introductory press conference, a visibly apprehensive Altman struggled to join in the Hog Call, stating afterwards, \"I'm not sure my friends in Omaha would like to see me do that.\" This was a sure sign of things to come, as the following day Altman claimed that he had a change of heart and immediately resigned, returning to Creighton where he had coached since 1994.\n\nJohn Pelphrey (2007\u201311)\nJohn Pelphrey was hired as the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks on Monday, April 9, 2007. Arkansas went 23\u201312 in Pelphrey's first season, defeating Indiana by 14 points in the first round of the NCAA Tournament before being put away by overall #1 seed North Carolina in the second round. The Razorbacks had an SEC regular season record of 9\u20137. In Pelphrey's second year, the Razorbacks struggled in conference play after starting the season 12\u20131 in non-conference games with two notable wins over the nationally ranked Oklahoma Sooners (#4) and the Texas Longhorns (#7). Conference wins were few and far between giving the Razorbacks a final conference record of 2\u201314. On March 13, 2011, John Pelphrey was dismissed as the head coach of the Razorbacks after an 18\u201313 season in which the Hogs missed postseason play for the third consecutive season, despite an impressive incoming recruiting class. Pelphrey finished his career at Arkansas with a record of 69\u201359 (.539).\n\nMike Anderson (2011\u201319)\nOn March 23, 2011, Mike Anderson signed a 7-year contract with Arkansas. Anderson previously coached the UAB Blazers and Missouri Tigers, and had already been an assistant coach at Arkansas under coach Nolan Richardson for 17 years. On March 26, 2011, Anderson was introduced in front of 5,000 fans in Bud Walton Arena. \nAnderson made three NCAA tournaments in his eight seasons, including a 27-win season in 2014\u201315 that resulted in a 5 seed in the tournament, the program's highest since 1999. The Razorbacks made another tournament two years later but lost to top-seeded North Carolina, the eventual national champion, in the second round. The following year saw them make the tournament for the final time in Anderson's tenure at Arkansas, but a loss to Butler ended the Hogs' season in the first round. \nFollowing an up-and-down 2018\u201319 campaign that culminated in an NIT berth, new athletic director Hunter Yurachek relieved Anderson of his duties on March 26 a little over a week after Arkansas lost to Indiana in the second round of the NIT. Anderson finished his career at Arkansas with a record of 170\u2013103 (.623), including his 1\u20131 record as interim coach in 2002.\n\nEric Musselman era and a return to national prominence (2019\u201324)\nOn April 7, 2019, Yurachek announced the hiring of Eric Musselman, then the four-year head coach at the University of Nevada. Musselman had previously coached in the NBA with the Sacramento Kings and the Golden State Warriors, where he was runner up for the NBA Coach of the Year Award, as well as college assistant coaching stops at Arizona State and LSU. Musselman's first Arkansas team finished the season with a record of 20\u201312, with Musselman becoming only the second coach in school history to finish his first season with at least 20 wins and the first since John Pelphrey in 2007\u201308. Musselman was also only the second head coach at Arkansas to finish his debut season with a winning percentage above 61% since Gene Lambert during the 1942\u201343 season. After Arkansas beat Vanderbilt in the first round of the 2020 SEC Basketball Tournament, the rest of the SEC Tournament, as well as the entire NCAA tournament, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making this the final Southeastern Conference men's basketball game of the 2019\u20132020 season. Arkansas junior guard Mason Jones was named the SEC Co-Player of the Year by the AP.\nIn only his second year, Musselman led the Razorbacks to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament, losing to eventual champion Baylor. This was Arkansas's deepest postseason run since their 1995 title game appearance. The team finished the 2021 season with a record of 25\u20137 (.781), and a conference record of 13\u20134 (.765). Freshman guard Moses Moody was named the SEC Freshman of the Year, and became the first \"one-and-done\" player in program history when he was drafted in the first round (14th overall) of the 2021 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. Arkansas advanced further in the NCAA Tournament than any other Southeastern Conference team, and finished with an overall ranking of #6 in the USA Today Coaches Poll. In his third year, Musselman led the Razorbacks to the Elite Eight again, losing to the Duke Blue Devils. Arkansas finished the 2022 season with a record of 28\u20139 (.757), and a conference record of 13\u20135 (.722). Again, Arkansas advanced further in the NCAA tournament than any other Southeastern Conference team, and finished with a ranking of #8 in the Coaches Poll, the highest in the SEC. Arkansas also won the early season Hall of Fame Classic tournament championship. In his fourth year, Musselman signed the #2 recruiting class in the nation, but the team slipped in SEC-play, finishing 8\u201310. The team would recover late in the season and made it to their third consecutive Sweet 16, losing to eventual national champion, UCONN. Musselman started his fifth season as head coach with a 9\u20134 record through the non-conference portion of the schedule, which saw the Razorbacks upset Duke. The conference schedule proved a little tougher, as the squad began SEC play with a 1\u20135 record. The Hogs would continue to show very few signs of cohesive play, teamwork, or overall leadership, finishing the season with a record of 16\u201317, including a lackluster 6\u201312 mark in SEC play.\nOn April 4, 2024, Eric Musselman officially left Arkansas to take the vacant head coaching position at USC.\n\nThe John Calipari era (2024\u2013 )\nOn April 10, 2024, Naismith Hall of Fame coach John Calipari, who had stepped down as head coach of Kentucky the day prior, was officially hired as the head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks.\nDespite an 0\u20135 start in SEC play, and 1\u20136 before February, Calipari rallied his troops and eventually made the NCAA Tournament as a 10 seed in his first season, taking out Kansas and St. John's to advance to the program's 15th Sweet Sixteen and fourth in five years.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Razorbacks have appeared in the NCAA tournament 36 times. Their combined record is 52\u201336. They were National Champions in 1994.\n\nNIT results\nThe Razorbacks have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) four times. Their combined record is 6\u20135.\n\nArkansas's All-Americans\nRetired numbers\nThe University of Arkansas athletic department has seen fit to retire only two jersey numbers in honor of former outstanding players:\n\nMoncrief (6'4\" 190 lbs.) led the Razorbacks to the 1978 Final Four and is, so far, Arkansas's only Consensus 1st team All-American player (1979). Moncrief also led the Hogs to three straight Southwest Conference regular season titles from 1977 to 1979, as well as the 1977 and 1979 SWC Tournament championships. He was a three-time All-SWC performer, and was also the SWC Player of the Year in 1979. Moncrief finished his career as the school's all-time leading scorer, until his record was broken in 1992.\nWilliamson (6'7\" 245 lbs.) led Arkansas to the 1994 National Championship and a runner-up finish in the 1995 Final Four. Corliss also lead Arkansas to three straight SEC West Division championships from 1993 to 1995, plus the 1994 SEC regular season title. Williamson was a two-time All-SEC performer, was the 1994 and 1995 SEC Player of the Year, and was named Consensus 2nd team All-American in both seasons.\n\nRazorbacks after the University of Arkansas\nNBA\nCorey Beck\nPatrick Beverley\nAnthony Black\nRon Brewer\nRonnie Brewer\nTony Brown\nCoty Clarke\nRicky Council IV\nTodd Day\nCourtney Fortson\nDaniel Gafford\nDusty Hannahs\nScott Hastings\nSteven Hill\nDerek Hood\nByron Irvin\nChris Jefferies\nDontell Jefferson\nIsaiah Joe\nMason Jones\nJoe Johnson\nJoe Kleine\nAndrew Lang\nDaryl Macon\nLee Mayberry\nClint McDaniel\nMel McGaha\nOliver Miller\nSidney Moncrief\nMoses Moody\nIsaiah Morris\nJannero Pargo\nBobby Portis\nAlvin Robertson\nNick Smith Jr.\nDean Tolson\nStanley Umude\nDarrell Walker\nJordan Walsh\nSonny Weems\nJaylin Williams\nCorliss Williamson\n\nOther professional leagues\nArkansas Sports Hall of Fame\nOlympians\nGordon Carpenter\nJoe Kleine\nR.

He coached until 1942, when he was called overseas to fight as an officer in World War II. Following his service, Jordan returned to Auburn to coach the 1945\u201346 team. He left Auburn to become the head men's basketball coach at Georgia after the season. Jordan finished with a record of 95\u201377 (.552) at Auburn.\n\nJoel Eaves\nJoel Eaves was Auburn's 12th head men's basketball coach, coaching from 1949 to 1963.

His most successful season at Auburn was the 1998\u201399 season, where he led the Tigers to an SEC regular season championship and the program's first ever #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, in which they reached the Sweet Sixteen. Ellis was named both SEC and National Coach of the Year in 1999. Ellis would take Auburn to the NCAA tournament two more times: reaching the Second Round in 2000 and returning to the Sweet Sixteen in 2003.\nEllis was released following the 2003\u201304 season after finishing the season with a 14\u201314 record. Auburn faced NCAA sanctions over alleged recruiting violations during the season, but Ellis was not found at fault after the investigation. Ellis finished with a record of 186\u2013125 (.598) at Auburn, trailing only Eaves on the school's all-time wins list.\n\nBruce Pearl\nBruce Pearl became Auburn's 20th head men's basketball coach on March 18, 2014.

It was renamed for the final time to Beard-Eaves-Memorial Coliseum in 1993, adding the name of former Auburn athletic director Jeff Beard.\nAuburn boasted a 393\u2013182 (.683) overall record at Beard\u2013Eaves\u2013Memorial Coliseum. Auburn had a winning record at home in 37 of the 42 seasons Auburn played in the Coliseum. Auburn's 30-game home winning streak from the 1997\u201398 season to the final game of the 1999\u20132000 season was the longest in Coliseum history. It was the nation's second longest current winning streak at the time and is the second longest home winning streak in Auburn history.\nAuburn played its final season in Beard\u2013Eaves\u2013Memorial Coliseum in the 2009\u201310 season. Auburn's final game in Beard\u2013Eaves\u2013Memorial Coliseum was on March 3, 2010; Auburn beat Mississippi State 89\u201380.\n\nNeville Arena\nOn June 29, 2007, Auburn announced plans to build a new $92.5 million basketball arena and practice facilities that would eventually be completed for the 2010\u201311 season. The arena was initially named Auburn Arena, but later renamed to Neville Arena in 2022. With a seating capacity of 9,121, Neville Arena is the smallest men's basketball arena in the SEC. Aside from the main court, the arena also contains two practice courts, a weight room, 12 suites, coaches offices, the Auburn Ticket Office, and the Lovelace Athletic Museum.\nAuburn played its first game in Auburn Arena on November 12, 2010, losing to UNC Asheville in overtime 70\u201369. Auburn's first win in Auburn Arena came on November 21, 2010, when Auburn beat Middle Tennessee 68\u201366. Auburn currently holds a 175\u201364 (.732) record in Neville Arena.\n\nTraditions\nRivalries\nAlabama\nSometimes referred to as the \"Iron Bowl of Basketball,\" Auburn and Alabama have a fierce rivalry that dates back to 1924. Auburn and Alabama first met in the Southern Conference Tournament on March 1, 1924, and Auburn lost 19\u201340. The two programs did not meet again until 1941 in the SEC tournament, a matchup that Auburn lost again 16\u201338. The programs have played regularly since 1948, meeting at least twice every season starting in 1949. Auburn's first win in the rivalry came in their sixth meeting on December 20, 1949, when Auburn beat Alabama 45\u201340.\nAuburn and Alabama have met in the SEC Tournament 9 times, including Auburn's 53\u201349 overtime victory over Alabama in the 1985 SEC Tournament championship game. Alabama leads the all-time series 103\u201369.\n\nGeorgia\nGeorgia is Auburn's oldest rival, first meeting in 1908 in Columbus, GA. Auburn won that game 34\u201320. Auburn and Georgia have played at least once every year since 1945. Auburn leads the all-time series 104\u201397.\n\nUAB\nThough Auburn and UAB have met just 21 times, the two programs have a strong history. The first game between the two schools was played on November 26, 1982, a matchup won by Auburn, 63\u201361. The programs met 16 more times over the next two decades until the series was discontinued after the 1999\u20132000 season. In 2015, Auburn and UAB agreed to a four-game series that reignited the rivalry. Auburn leads the all-time series 11\u201310.\n\nStudent section\nAuburn's student section is known as The Jungle. Auburn held a vote to name their student section at the start of the 2011\u201312 season, and The Jungle was chosen from several options. Auburn officially started The Jungle on January 11, 2012, for the Auburn\u2013Kentucky game. The Jungle was awarded the Sixth Man Award at the 2012 team banquet for its \"outstanding support throughout the season and making Auburn Arena one of the loudest venues in the SEC.\"\nThe Auburn student section was previously known as Lebo's Lunatics during Jeff Lebo's tenure at Auburn and the Cliff Dwellers during Cliff Ellis' tenure.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "biography": "The BYU Cougars men's basketball team represents Brigham Young University in NCAA Division I basketball play. It currently competes in the Big 12 Conference. Established in 1902, the team has won 27 conference championships, 3 conference tournament championships and 2 NIT Tournaments (1951 and 1966), and competed in 32 NCAA tournaments. The Cougars most recently appeared at the NCAA tournament in 2025. BYU appeared in the Elite 8 of the NCAA tournament in 1950, 1951, and 1981, its deepest runs at the tournament in program history. BYU's basketball program has won 1,939 games in its 108-year history, ranking 12th in all-time victories among all Division I programs.\nFrom 1999 to 2011, the team competed in the Mountain West Conference, followed by 12 seasons in the West Coast Conference. On September 10, 2021, the Big 12 Conference unanimously accepted BYU's application for membership, and BYU officially joined the conference for the 2023\u201324 season. The team is coached by Kevin Young.\n\nHistory\nBYU fielded its first basketball team in 1903. In 1906, the Cougars played their first game against Utah State University. In 1909, the team first played against the University of Utah. These two rivalries continue to this day. The Cougars won the first of their 27 conference championships in 1922 as a member of the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference led by star point guard River Jeffcoat.\nThe Cougars made the first of their 29 NCAA tournament appearances in 1950 under head coach Stan Watts. That Cougars came within one point of reaching the national semifinals. BYU's 1951 team was even more successful, winning 28 games and once again qualifying for the NCAA tournament.  In addition, the 1951 team won the first of two NIT championships for the school. The Cougars defeated AP No. 9 St. John's, AP #10 St. Louis and AP #13 Dayton to win the title. Notable players on that team include: Mel Hutchins, who was taken #2 in the 1951 NBA draft, was named the 1951\u201352 NBA co-rookie of the year and became a 5-time NBA All-Star with the Pistons and the Knicks; Roland Minson, who was drafted #16 overall in the 1951 NBA draft; and Loren C. Dunn, a future general authority in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Cougars would go on to make five more appearances in the NCAA tournament under Watts, and win their second NIT championship in 1966, although by that time the overall prestige of the NIT had fallen considerably. BYU has the most NCAA appearances of any men's team not to make the Final Four, having made thirty NCAA tournaments. BYU, alongside Xavier, Saint Joseph's, Boston College, Arizona State, and Davidson are each tied for second most in Elite Eight appearances without a Final Four with three (Missouri has the most with five). \nUnder Watts, BYU also became the first U.S. college basketball program to include an international player on its roster, as Finland native Timo Lampen debuted in the 1958\u201359 season. Later, BYU's Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107, born in Yugoslavia (modern-day Croatia), became the first international player to be named an All-American. His jersey was retired in the Marriott Center in March 2006 in the last home game of the season against the New Mexico Lobos. Watts retired as the winningest coach in BYU history.\n\nAfter Watts' retirement following the 1972 season, the program experienced five consecutive losing seasons from 1974 through 1978 before returning to the NCAA tournament in 1979 behind Danny Ainge and coach Frank Arnold. The Cougars reached the Elite Eight, one game short of the Final Four, in 1981, Ainge's senior season. That season, Ainge won the Wooden Award as the nation's most outstanding player.\nArnold left following the 1983 season and was replaced by LaDell Andersen, who had several successful seasons in the 1980s, including the 1987\u201388 season when the Cougars rose as high as #3 in the national rankings on their way to a 26\u20136 season. Andersen then resigned following a 14\u201315 season in 1989. He was replaced by Roger Reid, who guided the Cougars to 20-win seasons in each of his first six years and five NCAA tournament appearances.\nReid was fired in the middle of the 1996\u201397 season after a 1\u20136 start. Part of his firing had to do with a private comment Reid made to Chris Burgess, then considered the top high school player in the nation and a Latter-day Saint whose father had attended BYU; Reid suggested that Burgess had let down the entire church by choosing to attend Duke rather than BYU. Assistant coach Tony Ingle coached the team on an interim basis for the rest of the season and did not win a game; the Cougars' 1\u201325 record was the first time the school failed to reach 5 wins in a season.\nFollowing the season, Steve Cleveland was hired as the new head coach and returned the Cougars to prominence. In 2001, the Cougars won the MWC regular season and tournament championships, making their first NCAA tournament appearance since 1995. BYU had success under Cleveland, winning multiple conference championships and the conference tournament, reaching the NCAA tournament three times. They also had two draft picks: Travis Hansen, drafted by the Atlanta Hawks, and Rafael Araujo, drafted by the Toronto Raptors. After the 2004\u201305 season, Cleveland resigned to become the head coach at Fresno State; he was replaced by Dave Rose.\nDave Rose, co-captain of the University of Houston's 1983 \"Phi Slama Jama\" college basketball team, began the first of six straight 20-win seasons in 2005\u201306. Rose and assistant Dave Rice continued BYU's successful recruiting with the addition of All-American Jimmer Fredette in 2007 and DeMarcus Harrison in 2011. In June 2009, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and returned to coaching later that year. In 2010, Rose coached BYU to their first NCAA tournament victory in 17 years in a double-overtime win against the University of Florida. The following year, BYU made further inroads as a #3 seed when they advanced to the Sweet 16. On March 13, 2012, BYU set a record for the largest comeback in an NCAA tournament game, as they were down by 25 points at one point in their first game of the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and came back to beat the Iona Gaels 78\u201372.\nFollowing Tyler Haws' departure for an overseas professional career, Kyle Collinsworth became the Cougars' recognized leader, setting the NCAA record for career triple doubles and earning WCC Player of the Year honors as a senior. Since Collinsworth's departure, the Cougars have struggled, especially in the postseason. The program was dealt an additional blow when the NCAA announced penalties against the Cougars due to an alleged benefits scandal surrounding shooting guard Nick Emery. As part of those sanctions, BYU was ordered to vacate all victories where Nick Emery played over two seasons (a total of 47 wins).  The BYU athletics department has appealed the decision.  An official BYU athletics department statement (not attributed to a specific employee) read in part, \u201cThe vacation-of-records penalty is extremely harsh and unprecedented given the details of the case. For more than two decades, the NCAA has not required an institution to vacate games in similar cases where the COI found there was no institutional knowledge of or involvement in the violation by either the coaching staff or other university personnel. In fact, this sanction includes the most severe vacation-of-record penalty ever imposed in the history of NCAA Division I basketball for infractions that included no institutional knowledge or involvement. In addition, in the case most similar to this situation, appropriate penalties were imposed, but no wins were vacated. BYU believes the vacating of its game record penalty is unfair and not consistent with recent NCAA precedent.\u201d\nOn March 26, 2019, after thirteen seasons as head coach at BYU, Dave Rose announced his retirement. On April 10, 2019, BYU athletics director Tom Holmoe announced that Mark Pope, a former assistant at BYU under Rose and head coach of the Utah Valley University men's basketball team, had been hired as Rose's replacement.\nOn July 23, 2019, Nick Emery announced that he was retiring from college basketball. He cited unspecified challenges in his career that led to the decision.\nPope led a turnaround for the program in his first two seasons, with his inaugural season led by a trio of seniors in Yoeli Childs, T.J. Haws (younger brother of Tyler), and Jake Toolson. The team finished that season 24\u20138 and was projected to be a lock for the NCAA tournament as a single-digit seed before all postseason play was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020\u201321 season was projected to be a rebuilding year due to the loss of Childs, Haws, and Toolson to graduation, but Pope revamped the team in the offseason. Returning senior guard Alex Barcello was joined by graduate transfers Brandon Averette and Matt Haarms. The 2020\u201321 team finished the regular season 20\u20136 and made the NCAA tournament as a No. 6 seed, the program's first appearance in the tournament since the 2014\u201315 season.\nAfter lackluster 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, BYU was picked to finish 13th of 14 teams in the Big 12 prior to the 2023-24 season, their first competing in the conference. However, the Cougars posted a 10-8 conference record and went 22-9 during the regular season to finish fifth in the final conference standings. They defeated UCF in the second round of the Big 12 Conference tournament before losing to Texas Tech in the quarterfinals. They were awarded a 6-seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they lost to Duquesne in the first round.\nOn April 12, 2024, it was announced that Mark Pope had been hired as head coach at Kentucky. On April 16, BYU announced the hiring of Kevin Young, associate head coach of the Phoenix Suns, to serve as the team's new head coach. Young proceeded to sign what were then four of the nine highest-rated recruits in BYU history (according to 247Sports)\u2014Egor Demin, Kanon Catchings, Brody Kozlowski, and Elijah Crawford. Demin, who played for Real Madrid's U18 squad and was eligible to play US college basketball under new NCAA rules, was given a five-star rating by 247Sports, becoming (at the time) the highest-rated recruit and only five-star recruit in program history. These signings led many to consider BYU's 2024 recruiting class the best in program history to that point.\nBYU finished the 2024\u201325 regular season with a 23\u20138 record, 14\u20136 in Big 12 play. After starting conference play 2-4, the Cougars won 12 of their final 14 regular season games, including road wins over ranked Arizona and Iowa State teams and a 91\u201357 home win over #23 Kansas (BYU's largest-ever win over a ranked opponent, and tied for Kansas's worst loss of the Bill Self era). BYU finished tied for third in the final Big 12 standings, earning a double bye in the conference tournament. The Cougars defeated Iowa State in the quarterfinals before losing to Houston in the semifinals. Selected as a 6-seed for the NCAA Tournament, the Cougars defeated 11-seed VCU and 3-seed Wisconsin to advance to just the sixth Sweet Sixteen appearance in program history and first since 2011, before losing to 2-seed Alabama.\nOn December 10, 2024, AJ Dybantsa, ESPN's #1 overall recruit in the 2025 class and widely anticipated to be the first overall pick of the 2026 NBA Draft, announced his commitment to BYU on ESPN's First Take with Stephen A. Smith. Dybantsa immediately became the highest-rated recruit in BYU history, as well as the first ESPN 5-star recruit ever to sign with the program. Dybantsa, who played his senior year of prep basketball at Utah Prep in Hurricane, Utah, chose BYU over finalists North Carolina, Alabama, and Kansas.\n\nCoaches\nSeason-by-season results\nUnder Kevin Young:\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament\nBYU has made the NCAA tournament 31 times, with the Cougars having a record of 16\u201335.\n\nNIT\nBYU has made the National Invitation Tournament fifteen times, going 19\u201313. The Cougars were champions in 1951 and 1966.\n\nNAIA Tournament\nBYU made two appearances in the NAIA Tournament, going 2\u20132.\n\nIndividual honors\nRetired numbers\nThe Cougars have retired the numbers of four players in their history, with the most recent being the jerseys of Hutchins and Minson on February 16, 2013.\n\nNational Players of the Year\nDanny Ainge (1981)\nJimmer Fredette (2011)\n\nAll-Americans\nElwood Romney (1931\u201332)\nMel Hutchins (1951)\nRoland Minson (1951)\nJoe Richey (1953)\nJohn Fairchild (1965)\nDick Nemelka (1966)\nKre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107 (1972\u201373)\nDanny Ainge (1980\u201381)\nDevin Durrant (1984)\nMichael Smith (1988)\nJimmer Fredette (2010\u201311)\n\nConference Players of the Year\nJohn Fairchild (1965)\nDanny Ainge (1981)\nDevin Durrant (1983)\nTimo Saarelainen (1985)\nMichael Smith (1988)\nMekeli Wesley (2001)\nRafael Ara\u00fajo (2004)\nKeena Young (2007)\nLee Cummard (2008)\nJimmer Fredette (2011)\nTyler Haws (2014)\nKyle Collinsworth (2015)\n\nIndividual records\nPoints scored, single game: 52, Jimmer Fredette, March 11, 2011 vs. New Mexico\nPoints scored, season: 1,068, Jimmer Fredette, 2010\u201311\nPoints scored, career: 2,720, Tyler Haws, 2009\u201310, 2012\u201315\nField goals made, single game: 22, Jimmer Fredette, March 11, 2011, vs. New Mexico\nField goals made, season: 346, Jimmer Fredette, 2010\u201311\nField goals made, career: 987, Danny Ainge, 1978\u201381\nThree-point field goals made, single game: 10, Chase Fischer, November 25, 2014, vs. Chaminade; and Nick Emery, February 11, 2016, vs. San Francisco\nThree-point field goals made, season: 124, Jimmer Fredette, 2010\u201311\nThree-point field goals made, career: 296, Jimmer Fredette, 2007\u201311\nConsecutive games with a Three-point field goal made: 31, Nick Emery\nFree throws made, single game: 23, Jimmer Fredette, March 11, 2010, vs. TCU\nFree throws made, season: 252, Jimmer Fredette, 2010\u201311\nFree throws made, career: 724, Tyler Haws, 2009\u201310, 2012\u201315\nRebounds, single game: 27, Scott Warner, December 18, 1969 vs. Texas Tech\nRebounds, season: 471, Mel Hutchins, 1950\u201351\nRebounds, career: 1,053, Yoeli Childs, 2016\u201320\nAssists, single game: 16, Mike May, December 11, 1976, vs. Niagara\nAssists, season: 275, Kyle Collinsworth, 2015\u201316\nAssists, career: 703, Kyle Collinsworth, 2010\u201311, 2013\u201316\nSteals, single game: 9, Mark Bigelow, November 28, 1998, vs. Arizona\nSteals, season: 101, Jackson Emery, 2010\u201311\nSteals, career: 249, Jackson Emery, 2005\u201306, 2008\u201311\nBlocked shots, single game: 14, Shawn Bradley, December 7, 1990 vs. Eastern Kentucky\nBlocked shots, season: 177, Shawn Bradley, 1990\u201391\nBlocked shots, career: 208, Greg Kite, 1979\u201383\n\nNotable players\nJimmer Fredette\nDanny Ainge\nShawn Bradley\nTravis Hansen\nGreg Kite\nKre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107\nEgor D\u00ebmin\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "biography": "The Baylor Bears men's basketball team represents Baylor University in Waco, Texas, in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. The Bears compete in the Big 12 Conference. The team played its home games in Ferrell Center from 1988 until 2023.  Baylor now plays its home games in the Foster Pavilion and is currently coached by Scott Drew.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nLuther Burleson coached the first basketball team at Baylor in 1907 also doubling as the football coach. In Baylor's second season of basketball then cross-town rival TCU began their program which the Bears defeated twice during the 1908\u201309 season. Ralph Glaze's (1911\u20131914) .788 winning percentage ranks at the best all time in school history. Ralph Wolf (1927\u20131941) led Baylor to its first SWC Championship in 1932 after surviving and overcoming one of the first great tragedies in college athletics in his first season as coach.\n\nImmortal Ten\nOn January 22, 1927, Coach Ralph Wolf's Baylor basketball team was traveling by bus to play the University of Texas. As the bus passed through Round Rock, Texas, it approached railroad tracks on the south side of the business district on a drizzly, cloudy day. As the bus crossed the tracks, the occupants failed to hear the sound of the train whistle and ringing bell. The driver caught sight of the train at the last moment and tried to steer away, but the Sunshine Special crashed into the bus at nearly 60 mph tearing off the roof and right side.\n\nTen Baylor students and basketball players were killed by the impact. One player, James Clyde \"Abe\" Kelly, pushed his friend, Weir Washam, out the window of the bus just moments before the impact, saving Washam's life but costing Kelly his own. The bodies of Kelly and Robert Hailey were found horrifically stretched across the cowcatcher on the front of the train, with arms locked around each other and Kelly missing a leg. Ivy Foster Sr. of Taylor, Texas, had heard of the accident and rushed to the train station in Taylor to meet the train and assist where needed only to find his son among the dead.\nThe deceased were Jack Castellaw, Sam Dillow, Merle Dudley, L. R. \"Ivey\" Foster Jr., Robert \"Bob\" Hailey, James Clyde \"Abe\" Kelly, Willis Murrary, James \"Jim\" Walker, and William Winchester.\nThe remainder of the 1927 season was canceled. The tragedy had reverberations over the entire state and nation and led to the construction of the first railway overpass in Texas where the event occurred at Round Rock. Buses were later required to come to a full stop and open the door at all rail crossings to listen for trains. The Immortal Ten story has been commemorated each year since 1927 at first in Chapel services then later at the Freshman Mass meeting during Homecoming Week. In 2007, the event was also memorialized in bronze on the Baylor campus in Traditions Plaza.\nOn the 90th anniversary of the tragedy, January 22, 2017, the City of Round Rock held a memorial event to remember those who were killed in the train-bus collision. At the event, the city dedicated the \"Immortal Bridge,\" which arcs over the railroad tracks where the accident occurred. Green lampposts, green-and-gold striping and other markings were added to honor the 10 students who were killed there. The event was open to the public, and attendees included Baylor administrators and student leaders, the spirit squads, and Baylor's Golden Wave Band.\n\nPost-World War II success\nBaylor men's teams won five conference championships in the former Southwest Conference (1932, 1946, 1948, 1949*, 1950*; * denotes shared title). The Bears reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 1946, and reached the Final Four in 1948 and 1950. Bill Henderson's 1948 team advanced to play the Kentucky Wildcats for the NCAA championship, but fell 58\u201342 to Adolph Rupp's first national championship team. The team again advanced to the NCAA Final Four in 1950 under Henderson losing to the Bradley Braves 68\u201366. \nHenderson would have only two more winning seasons in the decade after making the Final Four. The subpar records of Henderson's latter tenure would become the norm for Baylor in the second half of the 20th century. Bill Menefee (1961\u20131973) was the only coach over the next 50 years to have a career record of over .500. He would lead the Bears to a national ranking in 1969 but failed to make the postseason that year. Menefee would later serve as Baylor's athletic director in the 1980s. Gene Iba's 1988 NCAA Tournament team would be the first NCAA Tournament appearance for the program in 38 years.\n\n2003 scandal\nThe men's basketball program was plagued by a scandal in 2003. Patrick Dennehy, a player for the team, was murdered by former teammate Carlton Dotson; then-coach Dave Bliss was forced to resign amidst allegations that he had violated NCAA rules by making financial payments to four players and that he made improper statements to the media characterizing Dennehy as a drug dealer. The school placed itself on probation, limited itself to 7 scholarships for two years and imposed a post-season ban for one year. Additionally, the NCAA further punished the team by initiating a non-conference ban for the 2005\u201306 season and extending the probationary period during which the school would have limited recruiting privileges.\n\nRecent resurgence\nThanks to the scandal, the 2005 Bears were hindered by only having 7 scholarship players and recorded only one win in conference play. From 2003 to 2007, the Bears would only win a total of 36 games. In spite of these challenges, head coach Scott Drew was able to put together a 2005 signing class ranked No. 7 nationally by HoopScoop.\nHowever, Drew engineered a very quick return to respectability. In 2008, the Bears reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 20 years with a 9\u20137 conference record and the team's first national ranking in 39 years. The January 23, 2008 116\u2013110 5OT win over Texas A&M at College Station officially became the longest game in Big 12 history. The 2008\u201309 team again was ranked early in the season but stumbled to a 5\u201311 conference finish before heating up in the Big 12 Tournament defeating both Kansas and Texas en route to the championship game versus Missouri, and lost by a score of 73\u201360. The 2008\u201309 team recorded the program's first postseason victory since 1950 in its first round NIT victory over the Georgetown Hoyas in Waco.\nThe 2008\u201309 team went on to advance to the NIT Final where they fell to Penn State. The 2009\u201310 squad was again ranked in both polls and pulled off the biggest road win in school history over the then #6 Texas Longhorns in Austin 80\u201377 on Jan. 30th. The Bears closed out the season with a Big 12 era best 11\u20135 record and #3 seed in the Big 12 Tournament.\nThe 2009\u201310 team was picked to finish 10th in the Big 12 in the Big 12 Coaches poll due to the graduation of several key players from the previous year. However, the team finished the regular season 23\u20136 and tied for 2nd in the Big 12 standings. Following a 2\u20131 record at the Big 12 tournament, the Bears were rewarded with a #3 seed in the South Region of the NCAA Tournament. The Bears defeated #14 seed Sam Houston State 68\u201359 in First round action and then defeated #11 seed Old Dominion 76\u201368 in Second round play to advance to the Sweet 16 hosted at Reliant Stadium in Houston. The Bears' Sweet 16 match-up was #10 seed Saint Mary's, which had defeated #2 seed Villanova the previous week to advance to the Sweet 16. The Bears won handily over the Gaels, 72\u201349, after leading 47\u201319 at the half. The Elite Eight was also held at Reliant Stadium and the Bears' opponent was the #1 seed Duke Blue Devils, the last #1 seed standing in the NCAA Tournament after the other three #1 seeds (Kansas, Syracuse, and Kentucky) were all defeated by lower seeded teams. In front of a very pro-Baylor crowd of over 47,000, the Bears were defeated by the Duke Blue Devils, 78\u201371, to end the magical run to the Elite Eight. It was the best season in the Scott Drew era as defined by conference standing, overall ranking, wins, and NCAA Tournament wins. The Bears finished the season ranked #10 in the final ESPN/Coaches poll\u2014the highest ranking in program history at that time.\nThe 2010\u201311 team started the season ranked 14th (according to the AP Preseason poll). The Bears began 7\u20130, and rose to 9th in the polls before falling to Gonzaga at a neutral court in Dallas. The team finished 18\u201313 overall and 7\u20139 in league play. The highlight of the season was LaceDarius Dunn becoming the Big 12's all-time leading scorer, and a sweep of the series versus ranked Texas A&M. After freshman star Perry Jones III was suspended by the NCAA for six games, the Bears proceeded to lose their first-round game of the Big 12 Tournament against Oklahoma.\nThe 2012 season saw another historic campaign for the Bears as they followed up the 2011 season with another successful conference run which saw the Bears win 30 games and make it to the Big 12 tournament title game, but eventually losing to the Missouri Tigers. The Bears were selected for the NCAA Tournament and made it all the way to the Elite Eight, which ended in a loss to eventual national champion Kentucky.\nThe 2013 season witnesses another winning campaign for the Bears as they followed up the 2012 Elite Eight season with another successful conference run which saw the Bears sweep both TCU and Texas Tech while only dropping one game to UT.  The Bears started out with a pre-season ranking of #19 in the country. The Bears finish conference play at .500 and were selected for the NIT tournament. The Bears made it all the way to the final, which ended in a win over Iowa, winning the tournament before a large crowd in Madison Square Garden and claiming the 2013 NIT Title.\nThe 2016\u201317 season saw one of the best starts in Baylor history, going 15\u20130 with wins over #4 Oregon, #24 Michigan State, #10 Louisville, and #7 Xavier. On January 9, Baylor would reach AP #1 for the first time in program history, although they would fall to #10 West Virginia that same day. Baylor remained within the top 12 for the remainder of the season and would finish 25\u20136, 12\u20136 in conference. They would fall to Iowa State in the first round of the Big 12 Tournament and receive a #3 seed in the 2017 NCAA tournament. Baylor would get to the Sweet Sixteen before being eliminated by South Carolina.\nThe 2019\u201320 season is considered one of the greatest in program history. They came into the season ranked #16 in the nation, but would fall to #24 after losing to Washington in the Armed Forces Classic. The Bears followed this loss with a 23-game win streak, including 6 ranked victories and a rise to #1 in the country. On January 11, Baylor defeated #3 Kansas on the road, winning in Lawrence for the first time in school history. Baylor's impressive start to the season ended on a sour note, losing 3 of their last 5 games before the Big 12 tournament. Baylor would finish the regular season 26\u20134 with a 15\u20133 conference mark, the most wins they had recorded in conference play, and remained ranked within the top 5 for the back half of the season. The NCAA Tournament would be canceled amid the COVID-19 pandemic, however numerous bracketologist considered the Bears as a 1-seed and had the potential to reach the Final Four. \nIn 2021, with the Bears\u2019 help of soon-to-be consensus All-American Jared Butler, Baylor defeated Hartford, Wisconsin, Villanova, and Arkansas to reach their first Final Four since 1950, where they defeated the in-state Houston Cougars, to reach the NCAA championship, where they defeated Gonzaga, winning their first title in school history, and spoiling the Bulldogs\u2019 then-perfect season in the process.\n\nFacilities\nIn its early days, Marrs McLean Gym was Baylor\u2019s basketball home, and doubled as the site of many physical education classes. Marrs McLean Gymnasium was built in 1938 and still stands on campus today.\nThe Heart O' Texas Fair Complex, now known as the Extraco Events Center, is located in Waco, Texas. It was once the prime basketball facility for Baylor University and was used from 1953 to 1988. The H.O.T Coliseum was constructed after McLennan County voters authorized a bond issue of $1.2 million in the early 1950s.\nStarting in 1988, the Bears played their home games at the Ferrell Center, adjacent to the Brazos River. It is named for Charles R. Ferrell, a Baylor student and legacy who died in 1967, and whose family's estate was a major benefactor of the arena. The main arena, Paul J. Meyer Arena, seats 10,284 people.\nIn June 2022, Baylor began construction on the Foster Pavilion to replace the Ferrell Center as the new permanent home for both the men's and women's basketball teams. The arena held its first game on January 2, 2024 where Baylor defeated Cornell.\n\nCoaching records\nNCAA national championships\nSeason-by-season results\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Bears have appeared in the NCAA tournament 16 times.

BSU's most recent appearance in the NCAA tournament was in 2024.\n\nHistory\nGreg Graham era\nAthletic director Gene Bleymaier hired Greg Graham to be head coach in 2002. In eight seasons, Graham had a 142\u2013112 record at Boise State and led Boise State to a berth in the 2004 NIT, 2008 NCAA tournament and 2009 CBI. For leading Boise State to the NCAA tournament, the Western Athletic Conference named Graham \"Coach of the Year\" in 2008.\nIn 2010, after a 15\u201317 season, Bleymaier fired Graham and stated: \"We appreciate everything that Coach Graham and his staff have contributed to Boise State the past eight years. We felt that in the best interest of the program we needed to make a change.\"\n\nLeon Rice era\nLeon Rice replaced Graham as head coach of the Broncos on March 26, 2010. In his first season as head coach, he led Boise State to the finals of the 2011 WAC men's basketball tournament and to the semifinals of the 2011 College Basketball Invitational. He is the first Boise State head coach to win 20 games in two of his first three seasons and has 20 or more wins in eight of his ten seasons. In 2013, he guided the Broncos to their first ever at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. In 2015, he led the Broncos to their first ever Mountain West regular season championship, and first conference title for Boise State since 2008, and was named the Mountain West coach of the year. On February 13, 2021, Rice won his 214th game to become the winningest head coach in Boise State history. In 2022, Leon Rice led Boise to arguably their best season in school history. The Broncos won a program high 27 games, 15 conference games, the Mountain West conference regular season championship, Mountain West conference tournament, an 8-seed in the NCAA tournament and the highest AP ranking in program history at 23. The following season, Leon Rice helped lead the team to 24 wins and consecutive tournament bids for the second time in school history.

    "biography": "The Bradley Braves men's basketball team represents Bradley University, located in Peoria, Illinois, in NCAA Division I basketball competition. They compete as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. The Braves are currently coached by Brian Wardle and play their home games at Carver Arena.\nBradley has appeared in nine NCAA tournaments, including two Final Fours and national championship games in 1950 and 1954. They last appeared in the NCAA tournament in 2019 (they qualified for the 2020 tournament which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and last reached the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in 2006. The Braves have also appeared in the National Invitation Tournament 23 times with an all-time NIT record of 27\u201320 and have won four NIT championships (1957, 1960, 1964, and 1982), second only to St. John's in appearances (30) and titles (5). Until the introduction of the Vegas 16 tournament in 2016, the program was invited to the initial offering of every national postseason tournament.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe Braves began playing basketball in 1902, starting out as independent.\nOne of their earliest coaches was Harold Olsen, who in 1959 was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor for his 24 years guiding the Ohio State Buckeyes to multiple Final Fours, spearheading efforts to create the NCAA tournament, helping initiate the 10-second rule and coaching the Chicago Staggs to the finals of the first BAA (later renamed NBA) playoffs.\n\nAlfred J. Robertson (1920\u20131948)\nAlfred J. Robertson was named coach of the Braves football and basketball teams in 1920. Robertson coached both teams until 1948. He is Bradley's all-time winningest coach with 316 wins over 26 seasons. Robertson died in 1948.\nIn 1938, Bradley went 18\u20132 and was one of six teams invited to the inaugural NIT, where they lost 53\u201340 to eventual national champion Temple.\nIn 1939, Bradley went 19\u20133, and received invitations to both the inaugural NCAA Tournament and the second NIT.  Bradley turned down the upstart NCAA Tournament and Oregon, which the Braves had defeated, took their bid, and went on to become the inaugural NCAA champion.  Bradley lost in the NIT semifinal to Long Island, 36\u201332.\nAfter a hiatus during World War II, the Braves qualified for the 1947 NIT, losing in the quarterfinals to West Virginia, 69\u201360.\n\nForddy Anderson (1948\u20131954)\nFollowing Robertson's death, the school hired Forrest \"Forddy\" Anderson from Drake.  Also in 1948, the school joined the Missouri Valley Conference for the first time.\n\nNational runner-up and scandal\nIn 1950, the Braves went 32\u20135 and won the MVC, earning a bid to the NCAA tournament. The Braves advanced to the National Championship game and lost 71\u201368 against CCNY, which accomplished perhaps the greatest feat in basketball history, winning the National Invitation and the NCAA tournaments in the same season.\nHowever, in 1951, a point-shaving scandal rocked CCNY specifically, New York, and college basketball as a whole. The scandal affected Bradley as Bradley players Gene Melchiorre, Bill Mann, Bud Grover, Aaron Preece, and Jim Kelly admitted to taking bribes from gamblers to hold down scores against St. Joseph's in Philadelphia in 1951 and against Oregon State in Chicago. Melchiorre, Mann, and George Chianakos pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, but avoided jail time. The others were not charged.\n\nContinued success\nIn 1952, the Braves went 32\u20136 and lost to Syracuse 76\u201375 in the final of the National Campus Basketball Tournament, which was held in response to the point-shaving scandals centered around New York. After the season, the Braves left the Missouri Valley Conference and became independent again.\nIn 1954, though only going 19\u201313, the Braves again advanced to the NCAA tournament's championship game, this time falling short to La Salle, 92\u201376.\nAnderson was hired away from Peoria to coach Michigan State after the season, where he would become the first coach in NCAA history to lead two schools to the Final Four.\nBob Vanatta coached the Braves for two seasons after Anderson departed, and led Bradley to the NCAA tournament Elite Eight in 1955 as an independent, where they lost to Colorado, 93\u201381. They returned to the MVC in 1955.  Vanatta would go on to coach the Memphis Tigers.\n\nChuck Orsborn (1956\u20131965)\nChuck Orsborn, a Bradley alum and basketball player in the 1930s, took over in 1956 after being an assistant from 1947 to 1956. In 1957, his first year as head coach, the Braves won the NIT championship over Memphis State, the school's first NIT title. The school returned to the NIT in 1958 and to the NIT championship game in 1959, losing to St. John's. In 1960, the Braves won their second NIT championship, defeating Providence in the title game.  The Braves were led by Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer, 2-time Consensus first-team All-American, future NBA champion and 7 time NBA All Star Chet Walker.\nIn Orsborn's first six seasons, the Braves finished ranked in the top-20 in the final AP Poll, including finishing in the top six each year between 1959 and 1962. However, conference rival Cincinnati was in the midst of a run that ended in five straight Final Four appearances, including two national championships. In the days before at-large bids in the NCAA tournament, Bradley was left outside the tournament field all six seasons and never reached the NCAA tournament in nine seasons under Orsborn.\nHowever, the Braves did win a share of their second MVC crown in 1962, sharing that title with eventual NCAA Champion Cincinnati, but lost in the NIT's first round. A return to the NIT in 1964 resulted in the Braves' third NIT championship in eight years. After another trip to the NIT in 1965, Orsborn took the position of Bradley's director of athletics and served in that function until 1978.\nFrom 1956 to 1965, he compiled a record of 194\u201356 (.774).  During this nine-year span as head coach, the Braves also earned six Associated Press top 20 finishes, Orsborn was named MVC coach of the year in 1960 and 1962. Orsborn also has the distinction of recording his first 100 victories in 120 games, which is sixth on the all-time list for college coaches.\n\nJoe Stowell (1965\u20131978)\nThe Braves again turned to a Bradley alum as Joe Stowell, who was an assistant coach under Orsborn, became Bradley's ninth head coach in 1965. In his 13 years as head coach, the Braves made only two postseason appearances: the 1968 NIT and the 1974 National Commissioners Invitational tournament. He was fired as head coach in 1978. Stowell finished with 197 wins, the second most in Brave history.\n\nDick Versace (1978\u20131986)\nBradley hired Dick Versace from Jackson Community College in 1978.  As an assistant at Michigan State University, Versace was heavily involved in the recruitment of Magic Johnson.  Versace led Bradley to the MVC regular season and tournament championships in 1980, losing to Texas A&M in the NCAA tournament, 55\u201353.  He won the regular season MVC championship again in 1982, but was snubbed by the NCAA selection committee, and the team won the NIT championship, defeating Purdue 67\u201358 at Madison Square Garden.\nIn the 1985\u201386 season, he was named National College Coach of the Year by the U.S. Basketball Writers' Association as the Braves went 32\u20133 and were ranked as high as #7 in the nation during the season, capturing the MVC title before falling to eventual national champion Louisville in the NCAA tournament second round. His back court players included future NBA All Star Hersey Hawkins and future NBAer and Bradley Head Coach Jim Les.  After this season, Versace left for the NBA where he became head coach of the Indiana Pacers and eventually President and General Manager of the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nStan Albeck (1986\u20131991)\nBradley alumnus and former Chicago Bulls head coach Stan Albeck was hired to lead the Braves in 1986.  In 1988, Albeck led the Braves to the MVC regular season and tournament titles behind National Player of the Year and national scoring leader Hersey Hawkins, and finished #11 in the final Associated Press Poll before losing to Auburn in the NCAA tournament, 90\u201386.  After leaving Bradley in 1991, Albeck became an assistant for the New Jersey Nets, Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors of the NBA.\n\nJim Molinari (1991\u20132002)\nBradley turned to Northern Illinois University head coach Jim Molinari to lead the Braves in 1991.  After NIT appearances in 1994 and 1995 the Braves, led by future NBA first round draft pick Anthony Parker, captured the MVC championship in 1996 and advanced to the NCAA tournament where they were defeated by Stanford, 66\u201358.  Molinari led the Braves to NIT appearances again in 1997, 1999 and 2001.\n\nJim Les (2002\u20132011)\nBradley turned to another alum, Jim Les, to take over for Molinari. Les was a senior on the 1986 Braves squad that went 32\u20133 before losing in the second round of the NCAA tournament. However, the Braves failed to finish above .500 in Les's first three years as head coach.\nIn 2006, the Braves won their final five games of the season to finish in a tie for fifth place in MVC play. The Braves surprised in the MVC tournament, reaching the championship game before losing to Southern Illinois. The Braves received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 13 seed, their first trip to the Tournament since 1996. In the Tournament, the Braves upset No. 4-ranked Kansas in the first round and upset No. 5-ranked Pittsburgh to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 1955. In the Sweet Sixteen, the No. 1-seeded Memphis defeated the Braves. After the season ended, Bradley's star center Patrick O'Bryant declared for the NBA draft where he was drafted 9th overall.\nEach of Les's next three Brave teams appeared in postseason play, losing in the second round of the 2007 NIT, and finishing as runners-up in the 2008 College Basketball Invitational and 2009 CollegeInsider.com Tournament.\nAfter a disappointing 2010 and a 20-loss 2011, the Braves fired Les.\n\nGeno Ford (2011\u20132015)\nKent State head coach Geno Ford was hired to replace Les. Ford's teams struggled under his leadership, failing to win more than seven games in conference play and finishing in last place in his first and final years at Bradley. The Braves did receive an invite to the College Basketball Invitational in 2013, where they advanced to the quarterfinals. In his final year, the Braves finished 9\u201324, 3\u201315 in MVC play. After the season, Ford was fired. He finished with a four-year record of 46\u201386 at Bradley.\nFord's tenure at Bradley was most notable for a lawsuit filed by Kent State, his former employer, seeking payment on a buyout clause in his contract. Ford was found liable for $1.2 million. Kent State continued actions against Bradley for \"tortious interference with Kent State\u2019s contractual relationship\" with Ford, but Kent State dropped the case in 2013.\n\nBrian Wardle (2015\u2013present)\nFollowing Geno Ford's firing, the school hired Green Bay head coach Brian Wardle. In Wardle's first year, the Braves continued their struggles, finishing the season 5\u201324 and in last place in the MVC. Wardle would have over 10 freshmen and only Donte Thomas was an active player who stayed from the Geno Ford era. In 2017, with Junior Donte Thomas as their best player, the 2017 Braves team improved to a 13\u201320 record and finished in a tie for sixth place in MVC play. In 2018 the Braves finished 20\u201313 while going 9\u20139 in the conference. They defeated Drake in the first round of the MVC tournament. Bradley then played #1 seeded \nLoyola-Chicago, the eventual standout Final Four team. Bradley failed to score down the stretch and lost a close game.\nIn 2019 Wardle led the Braves to the Cancun Challenge championship over Penn State. After this the Braves slumped and went 0\u20135 in conference play. The Braves regrouped and finished 5th in MVC play at 9\u20139. They beat Missouri State and upset Loyola-Chicago. Bradley looked to capture their first MVC tournament title since 1988. They played UNI,  the 6 seed, and were down by 18 points in the second half. Bradley rallied and cut the deficit to 6 with a 12\u20130 point run. The Braves went on to win the game. They entered March Madness for the first time since 2006 but lost to Michigan State 76\u201365 in the opening round. It was Coach Wardle's first NCAA tournament appearance with the Braves.\nWardle led the Braves to another improved season in 2019\u201320. Bradley finished with an overall record of 23\u201311 and 11\u20137 in Missouri Valley Conference play. Bradley won the MVC tournament title for the second year in a row. Due to COVID-19, the NCAA tournament was cancelled leaving the Braves without a postseason appearance.\n\nPostseason appearances\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Braves have appeared in nine NCAA Tournaments and have advanced to two final fours and two national championship games.

  "Bryant Bulldogs": {
    "biography": "The Bryant Bulldogs men's basketball team represents Bryant University in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The team currently competes in the America East Conference. They are led by head coach Jamion Christian and play their home games at the Chace Athletic Center. The Bulldogs have appeared twice in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, most recently in 2025.\n\nHistory\nBryant University competed in the NAIA as an NAIA independent program from 1963 until 1976 as the Bryant College Indians before the college became a member of the NCAA Division II level in 1977. Bryant's most successful season during the college's tenure in the NAIA came in the 1966\u201367 season when the team recorded an undefeated regular season, going 22\u20130 before losing the final two games of the 1966\u201367 season in the District 32 Tournament. The 22\u20132 overall record was the team's best during the NAIA years. The 22 wins set a team high win streak that still stands as a school record as of 2012. And the 22 total wins was not eclipsed until the 2003\u201304 season.\nWithin a few seasons of transitioning to NCAA Division II, the college became a charter member of the Northeast-10 Conference in 1980.\nIn 2008, Bryant began the transition to Division I with former Ohio University coach Tim O'Shea. The 2012\u201313 season marked the first year Bryant was eligible for the postseason, in which they qualified for the 2013 College Basketball Invitational.\nIn 2015, Bryant University assistant basketball coach Chris Burns came out as gay, making him the first openly gay coach in Division I men's basketball.\nO'Shea retired following the 2017\u201318 season and Jared Grasso was named head coach on April 2, 2018. Grasso orchestrated one of the nation's best turnarounds in his first season in Smithfield, improving the Bulldogs to a 10-win total after inheriting a squad that went 3\u201328 the prior season. Grasso was named a finalist for the Joe B. Hall Coach of the Year Award, given to the nation's top first-year head coach. The Bulldogs would continue to improve in 2019\u201320, rising to 15 victories including a win over Fordham in December. Grasso would then lead the Bulldogs to back-to-back Northeast Conference Championship games in 2020-21 and 2021\u201322, as well as winning the school's first ever NEC regular season championship in 2022. The 2022 NEC Championship game against Wagner resulted in not only Bryant winning their first ever NEC tournament championship, but they also clinched their first appearance in the NCAA Division I Tournament. This was Bryant's last season in the NEC, as the team moved to the America East Conference.\nBryant won the America East regular season title and America East Playoffs for the first time during the 2024-25 season, taking down Maine 77-59 in the final to clinch an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\nConference affiliations\nNAIA Independent \u2013 1963\u201364 to 1975\u201376\nNCAA Division II Independent \u2013 1976\u201377 to 1979\u201380\nNortheast-10 Conference \u2013 1980\u201381 to 2007\u201308\nNortheast Conference \u2013 2008\u201309 to 2021\u201322\nAmerica East Conference \u2013 2022\u201323 to Present\n\nPostseason\nNCAA Division I Tournament results\nBryant has made two appearances in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, with an overall record of 0\u20132.\n\nNCAA Division II Tournament results\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in seven NCAA Division II Tournaments.

    "biography": "The Cal State Fullerton Titans men's basketball team is the basketball team that represents California State University, Fullerton in Fullerton, California, United States.  The school's team currently competes in the Big West Conference.\n\nHistory\nIn 1978, the Fullerton men's basketball team, coached by Bobby Dye, made it to the Elite 8 in the 1978 NCAA Division I basketball tournament. They were considered the year's Cinderella story as a #7 seed (out of 8). The team defeated University of New Mexico at Tempe, AZ, and then defeated the University of San Francisco before losing to the University of Arkansas in regionals at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Fullerton was led by Greg Bunch, a CSUF Hall of Famer.\nBob Burton was head coach of the Titans men's team starting with the 2003\u201304 season. In 2008, the team finished the season 24-9, defeated UC Irvine 81-66 in the Big West Conference Championship. They qualified for their second NCAA tournament (first in 30 years), where they faced the (#3) Wisconsin Badgers as a #14 seed in the first round of the NCAA tournament, losing the game 71\u201358. After the 2013\u201314 season, Burton resigned on June 22, 2012 after nine seasons. His final record at Fullerton was 155\u2013122.\nDuring the 2012\u201313 season, interim head coach Andy Newman replaced Burton and guided the Titans to a 14\u201318 record overall and 6\u201312 record in the Big West Conference.\nFor the start of the 2013\u201314 season, Fullerton hired Dedrique Taylor as the team's head coach. Previously, Taylor had been an assistant under coach Herb Sendek at Arizona State University since 2006. Prior to that, Taylor also coached at the University of Nevada, Portland State, Loyola Marymount University and UC Davis. Taylor, has been long respected as one of the top recruiters in the west with strong ties to the Los Angeles area, thought to be a key component in winning at Fullerton. Taylor led the 2017\u201318 team to an invitation to play in the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The team lost in the first round to Purdue.\nIn 2022 the Titans qualified for the NCAA tournament as a #15 seed; they lost in the first round to Duke.\n\nPost season results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Titans have appeared in four NCAA tournaments.

  "Charleston Cougars": {
    "biography": "The Charleston Cougars men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team representing the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina. The Cougars compete in the Coastal Athletic Association. Home games are played at TD Arena, located on College of Charleston's campus. While a member of the NAIA, they were National Champions in 1983. The Cougars have appeared in the NCAA tournament seven times, most recently in 2024.\n\nHistory\nThe College of Charleston has sponsored a men's basketball team since 1898. They have been NCAA Division I since 1991 in the Trans-Atlantic Athletic Conference (now ASUN Conference), the Southern Conference and presently the Coastal Athletic Association (formerly the Colonial Athletic Association). In 2012, ESPN ranked Charleston as the 73rd best college basketball program in the previous 50 years, which was the highest ranking of all Division I teams in the state of South Carolina.\n\nJohn Kresse era (1979\u20132001)\nAfter hiring St. John's assistant coach John Kresse in 1979, the College of Charleston Cougars began to achieve some notoriety. Kresse would lead the program to its first District Championship in 1983, propelling them to their first NAIA Tournament appearance. The Cougars advanced through the first four rounds and eventually defeated West Virginia Wesleyan 57\u201353 to win the 1983 NAIA Championship.\nKresse continued the program's success in the NAIA, winning five-straight District 6 Championships to ensure five-straight NAIA Tournament berths from 1985\u201389. Despite failing to win another national championship, Kresse led the Cougars to a third-place finish in the 1988 Tournament.\nDuring the 1991\u201392 season, the Cougars made the jump to Division I and defeated UNC\u2013Charlotte 68\u201354 in their first game. After posting a 38\u201316 record through two seasons as an Independent program, the Cougars joined the Trans Atlantic Athletic Conference in 1993.\nIn their first season of conference play, the 1993\u201394 Cougars played to a 24\u20134 record (14\u20132 against TAAC opponents), earning the school its first regular season championship. Kresse earned his first TAAC Coach of the Year award, and Marion Busby earned the school's first TAAC Player of the Year award. The Cougars were unable to participate in the 1994 TAAC Tournament due to NCAA regulations, but they did receive an at-large bid to the 1994 NCAA Tournament as a #12 seed, ultimately losing to #5 Wake Forest 68\u201358 in the first round.\nOn December 15, 1994, Charleston's home arena, the F. Mitchell Johnson Center, was renamed as the \"John Kresse Arena\" in the coach's honor.\nKresse led the program to four more TAAC regular season championships from 1995\u20131998, earning back-to-back NIT invitations in 1995 and 1996. The Cougars defeated Tennessee 55\u201349 in the first round of the 1996 NIT behind the leadership of TAAC Player of the Year Thaddeous Delaney, before falling to Rhode Island 58\u201362 in overtime during the second round.\nThe 1996\u201397 Cougars, led by TAAC Player of the Year and future NBA-player Anthony Johnson, earned the first automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament in school history. After playing to a 29\u20133 record (16\u20130 in conference) and defeating Florida International 83\u201373 in the 1997 TAAC Championship Game, the Cougars would enter the 1997 NCAA Tournament as a #12 seed, despite being ranked No. 16 in the National AP Poll. Kresse's Cougars made program history by upsetting the #5 seed Maryland Terrapins 75\u201366 in the first round, before falling to the eventual National Champion, #4 Arizona 73\u201369.\nThe following year, 1997\u201398, saw the Cougars win a fifth-straight regular season championship after playing to a 24\u20136 record (14\u20132 in conference). Kresse earned his third TAAC Coach of the Year honor, and junior guard Sedric Webber was named TAAC Player of the Year, the third-straight, and fourth overall, Player of the Year in program history. The Cougars once again defeated Florida International in the TAAC Championship game, winning 72\u201363 to ensure their second NCAA Tournament appearance in a row, and third overall. As a #14 seed in the 1998 Tournament, the Cougars lost to #3 Stanford 67\u201357 in the first round.\nDuring the 1998\u201399 season, the program transitioned from the TAAC to the Southern Conference, and gained national attention after upsetting then-No. 3 North Carolina 66\u201364 on December 5, 1998. After going 16\u20130 in conference, and 28\u20133 overall, the Cougars would win their first SoCon regular season championship, Kresse would earn his first SoCon Coach of the Year honor, and Sedric Webber would be named SoCon Player of the Year, his second-straight Player of the Year award. After running the table during the regular season, the Cougars would go on to defeat Furman 98\u201374, Western Carolina 80\u201349, and Appalachian State 77\u201367 in the championship game of their first SoCon Tournament, earning the program's third NCAA Tournament berth in a row. As a #8 seed in the 1999 Tournament, the highest seeding in program history, the Cougars were defeated by #9 Tulsa 62\u201353 in the first round.\nKresse coached the team for three more seasons into the new millennium, earning another regular season championship during the 1999\u201300 season, and Southern Division championships in 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302, with teams led by SoCon Player of the Year Jody Lumpkin. Kresse retired at the end of the 2001\u201302 season, and still lives in Charleston to this day.\nOver 23 years Kresse coached to a career record of 560\u2013143 (.797), good for the 11th-highest winning percentage across all divisions in college basketball history. His Division I coaching record of 258-64 (.801) ranked the 5th highest in Division I history at the time of his retirement.\n\nTom Herrion era (2002\u201306)\nAfter the retirement of Kresse in 2002, Tom Herrion was hired as the 20th head coach in program history.\nHis first Charleston team won the Great Alaska Shootout in 2002 after defeating Wyoming 81\u201372, Oklahoma State 66\u201358, and Villanova 71\u201369 in the championship game, earning senior guard Troy Wheless the title of Tournament MVP. Herrion led his first team to a 25\u20138 record during the 2002\u201303 season, earning a regular season championship and an invitation to the 2003 NIT before losing in the second round. After the conclusion of the season Wheless was named SoCon Player of the Year, the program's third such honor since joining the SoCon, and seventh overall. Herrion's 25 victories marked the highest total of any first-year NCAA Division I head coach during the 2002\u201303 season.\nUnder Herrion the Cougars finished with a 20\u20139 record in 2003\u201304, an 18\u201310 performance in 2004\u201305, and a 17\u201311 finish in 2005\u201306. Herrion's final record was 80\u201338.\n\nBobby Cremins era (2006\u201312)\nThe College of Charleston hired former Georgia Tech head coach Bobby Cremins in 2006. In four out of Cremins' five complete seasons, Charleston won at least 20 games, and the Cougars advanced to a national postseason tournament in three consecutive seasons. During Cremins' tenure the Cougars also relocated from John Kresse Arena to the Carolina First Center (later renamed TD Arena). Their first home game in the new stadium was a 72\u201366 victory over SIU Edwardsville on November 14, 2008.\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, the Cougars were put back in the national spotlight when they upset then-No.9 North Carolina on January 4, 2010, at TD Arena. Cremins led the program to a first round victory over Troy in the 2009 College Basketball Invitational, and had another first round win over Eastern Kentucky in the 2010 CBI.\nThe 2010\u201311 Cougars earned the program's first regular season championship in eight years with a 14\u20134 conference record, 25\u201310 overall. Cremins was named SoCon Coach of the Year and senior Andrew Goudelock was named SoCon Player of the Year. After losing to Wofford in the Championship Game of the SoCon Tournament the squad was invited to the 2011 NIT. The Cougars went on the longest postseason run in Division I program history, defeating Dayton 94\u201384 in the first round and Cleveland State 64\u201356 in the second round before falling to the eventual champions, Wichita State, 82\u201375 in the quarterfinals.\nDuring the 2011\u201312 season Cremins took a leave of absence due to exhaustion and retired at the conclusion of the season. His overall record at Charleston was 125\u201368.\n\nDoug Wojcik era (2012\u201314)\nDoug Wojcik, the all-time wins leader at the University of Tulsa, was named the 22nd all-time head coach at the College of Charleston on April 1, 2012. In his first season with the Cougars, Wojcik led Charleston to the SoCon Tournament Championship, ultimately losing to Davidson. The Cougars were added to the 2013 CBI, where they lost to George Mason in the first round. Charleston moved to the Colonial Athletic Association (now the Coastal Athletic Association) in 2013 and Wojcik's Cougars struggled to a 6\u201310 conference record. He was fired on August 5, 2014, with a 38\u201329 overall record.\n\nEarl Grant era (2014\u20132021)\nEarl Grant, a former Clemson and Wichita State assistant, was named the Cougars' 23rd all-time head coach on September 2, 2014. Charleston struggled in Grant's first year at the helm, finishing the season with just nine wins, a record-low since joining Division I. The Cougars did, however, win their first-ever CAA tournament game, a 56\u201348 decision over Drexel in the first round. Grant got his first signature win at Charleston the following season on November 30, 2015, when the Cougars defeated LSU 70\u201358 at TD Arena.\nGrant's Cougars experienced the national postseason for the first time under his watch during the 2016\u201317 season. After finishing the regular season with a 23\u20138 record and losing in the CAA Tournament final, Charleston received an at-large bid to the 2017 NIT as a five seed. The Cougars ultimately lost at Colorado State, 81\u201374.\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, Coach Grant and the Cougars managed a 26\u20138 record, going 14\u20134 in the conference and undefeated at home, with sweeps over conference teams Delaware, Hofstra, Northeastern and UNC Wilmington. The Cougars would take the regular-season conference championship in a 79\u201358 win over Elon and would enter the CAA Tournament as a #1 seed, going on to win the tournament championship in an 83\u201376 OT win over Northeastern. Charleston would then receive a #13 seed spot in the 2018 NCAA Tournament and play #4 Auburn in San Diego, CA. After three more winning seasons without reaching the postseason, Grant left to be the head coach at Boston College.\n\nPat Kelsey era (2021\u20132024)\nThe Cougars hired Pat Kelsey, former head coach at Winthrop University, on March 25, 2021. Kelsey led the Cougars for just three seasons, but his era at Charleston is considered one of the most successful in program history. He led the team to a 75\u201327 (.735) overall record over his three seasons at the helm, including two conference regular season titles, two conference championship titles and two NCAA tournament appearances. He also introduced the \"Our City\" motto, meant to unite support for the team with the city of Charleston.\nHis team finished the 2022\u201323 season with a 31\u20134 record, including 4 weeks in the AP Top 25 poll, a conference championship title, and an NCAA tournament appearance. The team also won the Charleston Classic for the first time in program history. Kelsey signed an amended 5-year contract with the College of Charleston that would pay him a $1.1 million base salary, making him highest paid head coach in the Coastal Athletic Association.\nThe success continued into the 2023\u201324 season as he led the program to its first outright regular season title since 2003 and was named the Coastal Athletic Association Coach of the Year. Following the end of the season, Kelsey accepted the position as head coach at the University of Louisville.\nCollege of Charleston president Andrew Hsu praised Kelsey upon news of his new position at Louisville, saying \"he brought so much energy and excitement to Our City ... his impact goes far beyond basketball. His success reignited a premiere basketball school in a premiere city.\"\n\nChris Mack era (2024-present)\nChris Mack, the former head coach at Xavier University and the University of Louisville, for whom Pat Kelsey was an assistant coach at the former, was named the 25th head coach in program history on April 2, 2024.\n\nConference affiliations\n1963\u201364 to 1969\u201370 \u2013 Dixie Intercollegiate Athletic Conference\n1970\u201371 to 1990\u201391 \u2013 NAIA independent\n1991\u201392 to 1997\u201398 \u2013 Trans Atlantic Athletic Conference\n1998\u201399 to 2012\u201313 \u2013 Southern Conference\n2013\u201314 to present \u2013 Coastal Athletic Association\nNotes\n\nYear-by-year history\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Cougars have appeared in the NCAA tournament seven times.

UC experienced moderate success in the early days, with the main highlights being them winning several conference championships in both the Buckeye Athletic Association and the Mid-American Conference.\n\n1954\u20131958 \u2013 The start of something special\nCincinnati opened its new on-campus arena, Armory Fieldhouse, with a 97\u201365 win over Indiana in 1954. One of the first of Cincinnati's long list of standouts was Jack Twyman, who earned All-America status in 1954\u201355. He went on to NBA stardom and is in the Basketball Hall of Fame.\nOscar Robertson made his debut in 1957, and quickly emerged as one of the top college players in the country. \"The Big O\" is still widely recognized as one of the greatest to ever play the sport\u2014college or professional. A unanimous three-time All-American, he was college basketball's all-time leading scorer at the close of his career. His 33.8 scoring average today ranks third on the NCAA career charts, and he has the NBA's third-most career assists. The Bearcats celebrated their entry into the Missouri Valley Conference by winning the league title. Cincinnati made its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1958, losing to Kansas State in overtime at the Midwest Regional.\n\n1958\u20131964 \u2013 A run unlike any other\nSparked by the exploits of Robertson, who became the first player to lead the nation in scoring in three consecutive seasons, Cincinnati advanced to the Final Four in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, settling for third place both years. Then the Bearcats, with a rookie head coach (Ed Jucker) and without Robertson, won their first national title in 1960\u201361. Then to prove that its 1961 championship was no fluke, UC repeated as national champion in 1961\u201362. Cincinnati made a fifth-straight trip to the Final Four in 1962\u201363, and narrowly missed capturing a third-straight national crown when the Loyola Ramblers overcame a 15-point deficit and defeated the Bearcats by a basket, 60\u201358, in overtime.\nDuring those five seasons, UC recorded a 37-game win streak and posted a 161\u201316 ledger. The five straight Final Four appearances is a feat topped only by UCLA. Connie Dierking (1958), Ralph Davis (1960), Bob Wiesenhahn (1961), Paul Hogue (1961, 1962), Tom Thacker (1963), Tony Yates (1963), Ron Bonham (1963, 1964) and George Wilson (1963) were accorded All-American recognition with Wilson playing on the U.S. 1964 Olympic gold medal team.\n\n1970s \u2013 Continued success\nThe Bearcats during the 1970s compiled a 170\u201385 record (.667). The success was led by flashy-dressing head coach Gale Catlett, who led the Bearcats to the NCAA tournament in the 1974\u201375 season returning Cincinnati to the Big Dance for the first time since the 1965\u201366 season. Cincinnati inaugurated the Metro Conference by winning the league's first two tournament championships and made four consecutive post-season appearances from 1974 to 1977, including a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1975. Catlett was also a skilled recruiter, bringing Jim Ard (1970), Lloyd Batts (1973), Steve Collier (1976), Gary Yoder (1977), Bob Miller (1978) and Pat Cummings (1979) to Cincinnati who all earned All-American recognition. Cummings closed his career as UC's No. 2 leading scorer of all time.\nAfter the 1977\u201378 campaign Catlett would leave to coach his alma mater West Virginia and Cincinnati hired Chicago Bulls head coach Ed Badger. A month into Badger's first season, the Bearcats were banned from postseason play and live television for two years due to numerous violations under Catlett, including recruiting violations and impermissible benefits. Badger would have only two winning seasons during his tenure, and resigned after the 1983 season.\n\n1980\u20131988 \u2013 Down in the dumps\nTony Yates, a member of the national championship teams in the 1960s, succeeded Badger as head coach in 1983. In his first season in 1983\u201384, UC went 3\u201325 (0\u201314 in conference), the school's worst season (winning-percentage-wise) since going 1\u20139 in 1915. After tallying only two more winning seasons, Yates was fired after the 1989 season. The Bearcats of the 1980s failed to make a single NCAA tournament, and only had one postseason appearance in the 1985 NIT. All told, the 1980s were an especially hard time for the Bearcats, who went 112\u2013142 over the course of the decade and notched only two winning seasons.\n\n1989\u20132005 \u2013 Back into the national spotlight\nBob Huggins, the former head coach at the University of Akron, was named head coach at UC prior to the 1989\u201390 season. Taking over a team with a proud history but one that had not had any legitimate success in over a decade, Huggins quickly turned things around and rekindled the national championship expectations of the past. Posting winning records in each of his first two seasons, Huggins would soon prove that his team was for real and in only his third season at the helm he directed UC to the 1992 Final Four. The 1992 team that went on to lose to Michigan's \"Fab Five\" in the Final Four, would set a high standard of success that would last for years to come. The Bearcats advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament three times, and reached the Sweet 16 four times while Huggins was coach. Cincinnati also won its conference season and/or tournament title in 12 years out of a 13-year span (1992\u20132004). UC was also one of the top ranked teams of this time, often being ranked in the top 10 if not number one in the country. Huggin's team merits include claiming eight league tournament titles and 10 regular season crowns in addition to appearing in 14 consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1992\u20132005).\nFifteen Bearcats had garnered first team all-conference honors during this era with three of those, Danny Fortson, Kenyon Martin and Steve Logan, picking up a total of four C-USA Most Outstanding Player Awards. Fortson, Nick Van Exel, Ruben Patterson, Bobby Brannen, Melvin Levett, Logan, Martin and Pete Mickeal have joined Cincinnati's list of All-Americans. Fortson was a consensus first team All-American in 1996\u201397 after receiving second team recognition in 1995\u201396. Martin was college basketball's top player of the 1999\u20132000 season, making a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards. Logan was a consensus All-American in 2001\u201302 and a finalist for every national player of the year award. Several Bearcats were NBA Draft Picks, including Martin being the number one overall pick in 2000.\nHuggins was forced to resign by school president Nancy Zimpher in August 2005. Zimpher was angered by the lackluster academic performance of Huggins' teams (he routinely only graduated 30 percent of his players), and felt that Huggins didn't fit in with her plan to upgrade UC's academic reputation. Huggins hadn't helped his standing with Zimpher when he was arrested for DUI in 2004.  This decision was met wide widespread criticism among virtually everyone connected to the program, creating a situation that would not bode well for the team in the near future. Looking to stay within the program, the school immediately promoted assistant coach Andy Kennedy as interim head coach for the 2005\u201306 season.\n\n2006\u20132009 \u2013 Resurrecting a gutted program\nIn the spring of 2006, Mick Cronin was hired as head coach, replacing interim coach Andy Kennedy after the dismissal of Bob Huggins. Cronin was tasked with picking up the pieces from a depleted program after Huggins was abruptly asked to resign three months before the 2005 season, and a temporary coach in Kennedy for the previous season. Due to the school having little-to-no recruiting going on for around a full calendar year, Cronin was forced to scrounge for players. He even had a couple players on the school's football team play, one being future NFL linebacker Connor Barwin.\nAlthough Cronin's teams struggled early in his UC career, he improved the school's win total each of his first five seasons. After two straight losing seasons, UC began to get back on track under Cronin in the 2008\u201309 season with an 18\u201314 record. This was then followed by an NIT appearance and a brief return to the Top 25 polls during the 2009\u201310 campaign.\n\n2010\u20132019 \u2013 Return to winning ways\nDespite the surroundings, Cincinnati began the retooling process, becoming the only program from a major conference to improve its win total every season from 2007 to 2011, building from 11 wins in 2007 to 26 victories and a return to the NCAA tournament in 2011.\nNow a fixture at the Big Dance, Cincinnati can include itself among an elite list of six programs appearing in eight consecutive NCAA Tournaments, along with Duke, Gonzaga, Kansas, Michigan State and North Carolina. This run of 9 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances by Cincinnati would see UC advance to the Round of 32 five times and to the Sweet 16 once as of the 2018\u201319 season.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, Mick Cronin discovered he had an arterial dissection and sat out the rest of the season, last coaching December 17 against San Diego State. Assistant Coach, Larry Davis took the reins and lead the team onto a respectable season and classic overtime victory over Purdue in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nIn 2013\u201314 season and 2017\u201318 season Cincinnati were American Athletic Conference regular season champions and in 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319 seasons Cincinnati won the American Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament. During this time many notable players came to Cincinnati with several progressing to the NBA, such as Sean Kilpatrick, Troy Caupain, Jacob Evans, and Gary Clark. The Bearcats also featured consecutive AAC Player-of-the-Year (POY) winners in Gary Clark and Jarron Cumberland.\n\n2020\u2013present \u2013 Coaching shakeups\nOn April 9, 2019, it was announced that Mick Cronin would be leaving Cincinnati to become the next head coach of the UCLA Bruins after UCLA had fired Coach Steve Alford earlier in the season (ironically, his firing was due in part to a blowout loss to the Bearcats). On April 14, 2019, it was announced that John Brannen was being hired as the new head coach.\nIn his first year, Brannen would lead the 'Cats to a share of the regular season AAC championship before both the AAC tournament and the NCAA tournament were cancelled due to COVID-19. In Brannen's second season, the team struggled to find its footing and dealt with 5 COVID related opt-outs and a 25-day program pause. The Bearcats would finish 12\u201311 but enjoyed a surprising run in the 2021 AAC tournament before losing in the final.\nOn March 26, Athletic Director John Cunningham announced the university would begin investigating allegations against the program. Soon after on April 3, it was announced that head coach John Brannen was placed on indefinite leave. Finally, on April 9 the school announced Brannen had been relieved of his duties effective immediately along with assistants.\nOn April 14 Cincinnati hired Wes Miller to become their next head coach, replacing Brannen.\n\nNotable seasons\n1959\u201360 Oscar Robertson scored a school record 62 points in an early-February game vs. North Texas State and in the process became the NCAA's all-time leading career scorer. Robertson claimed national player of the year honors for the third straight year while Cincinnati won its third straight Missouri Valley title. The Bearcats made their second trip to the Final Four. California again turned back UC's title hopes as UC finished third. George Smith stepped down as head coach to become athletic director, capping a career in which he posted a 154\u201356 record in eight years.\n1960\u201361 Largely an unknown team, without Robertson, and with a new head coach, Ed Jucker, in command, Cincinnati stumbled to a 5\u20133 start. The Bearcats then won their next 22 contests, garnering a league title, a third straight trip to the Final Four, and a national championship. In the first-ever championship game matchup of two teams from the same state, UC defeated Ohio State in overtime, 70\u201365.\n1961\u201362 Cincinnati fashioned a 28\u20132 record, but the Bearcats had to defeat Bradley in a league playoff game to defend their national title. UC won the Midwest Regional to earn its fourth straight trip to the Final Four. After edging UCLA, 72\u201370, in the semifinals, Cincinnati became a repeat champion with a 71\u201359 win over Ohio State. Paul Hogue was the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n1962\u201363 UC breezed to its fifth straight Missouri Valley Conference crown and, after winning the Midwest Regional, a fifth straight trip to the Final Four. An 80\u201346 win over Oregon State in the semifinals put the Bearcats in position to win a third straight national title. Cincinnati held a 15-point lead over Loyola (Ill.) in the second half of the championship game, only to have the Ramblers come back to win, 60\u201358, in overtime. Cincinnati led the nation in defense.\n1991\u201392 The Bearcats opened play in the Great Midwest Conference and marked their debut in this new league by sharing the regular season title and winning the tournament crown. Cincinnati made its first appearance in two decades in the Top 20 rankings. The Bearcats were seeded fourth in the Midwest Regional. UC defeated its four regional foes by an average margin of 20.8 points to make its sixth appearance in the Final Four. Michigan's \"Fab Five\" edged UC, 76\u201372, in the semifinal.\n1999\u201300 Cincinnati was the nation's top team and Kenyon Martin was college basketball's top player. UC was ranked No. 1 in the national polls for 12 of 18 weeks and Martin made a clean sweep of the national player of the year awards (Naismith, Wooden, Rupp, Robertson, NABC). The Bearcats tied a school record for victories with a 29\u20134 record and won their fifth straight Conference USA regular season title. UC seemed poised for a run for the national title until Martin suffered a broken leg in the Conference USA tournament. Martin was a unanimous first team All-American with Pete Mickeal earning honorable mention honors. Cincinnati went from the #1 team in the country to a 2-seed in the NCAA tournament, and fell to Tulsa in the 2nd round.\n2001\u201302 Unranked in the major polls at the start of the season, the Bearcats posted a 31\u20134 record\u2014setting a new standard for victories\u2014won a seventh consecutive Conference USA regular season championship, captured the C-USA tournament crown and earned their first-ever No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Steve Logan earned his second straight Conference USA Player of the Year award, was a consensus All-American and a finalist for every national player of the year honor. The Bearcats were upset in the 2nd round to 8-seed UCLA in a double-overtime thriller.\n2011\u201312 After starting the season 5\u20133 with bad losses and dealing with the aftermath and suspensions from the Crosstown Shootout brawl, UC's season was already on the brinks halfway through December. The Bearcats then went on a run against fantastic competition and wound up beating 8 ranked teams, the most ranked wins in any Cincinnati season in history. The biggest win came against the 31\u20131 and #2 Syracuse Orange in the Big East tournament semifinals. The Bearcats went on to the Sweet 16 where they lost to Ohio State. The latter half of this season is considered by many to be a big turning point in Mick Cronin's coaching career.\n2017\u201318 Cincinnati began the season with high hopes, featuring a team hallmarked by four \"1000 point career scorers\" (Gary Clark, Jacob Evans, Kyle Washington, and Cane Broome). They spent the entire season in the national polls, peaking at #5 - this was fueled by their defensive prowess which ranked second overall nationally. They earned their first outright American Athletic Conference regular season and tournament championships and tied the school record for wins, going 31\u20135. Their season ended with a second round NCAA tournament upset to Nevada who tied the record for the 2nd largest NCAA Tournament comeback- surmounting a 22-point deficit to win by 2.\n\nNotable games\n01/09/1958 \u2013 Cincinnati 118, Seton Hall 54: 19-year-old sophomore Oscar Robertson (\"The Big O\") dropped 56 points, scoring more than all of Seton Hall, and caught the attention of New York City in a road win. His 56 points, at the time, was a Madison Square Garden record.\n03/25/1961 \u2013 Cincinnati 70, Ohio State 65: The Buckeyes were the defending champs, 27\u20130 and No. 1 in the nation. They took on state rival No. 2 Cincinnati in the National Championship. A layup by Ohio State's Bobby Knight sent the game into overtime, tied at 61. Cincy, led by Paul Hogue and Bob Wiesenhahn, took it from there, winning, 70\u201365, giving the Bearcats their first basketball title in school history.\n03/24/1962 \u2013 Cincinnati 71, Ohio State 59: Cincinnati and Ohio State, again ranked Nos. 1 and 2 at the end of the regular season, became the first teams to play each other in two consecutive NCAA championship games. Unlike the year before, this game was not close. Cincy led by eight at the half and won by 12 as Paul Hogue and Tom Thacker led the way with 22 and 21 points, respectively. When it was over, the Bearcats' second-year coach Ed Jucker had a pair of NCAA titles in two tries.\n03/23/1963 \u2013 Loyola Chicago 60, Cincinnati 58: Despite its No. 3 ranking and a scoring average of 91.8, nobody expected Loyola of Chicago to beat Cincinnati, especially when the Ramblers fell behind by 15 in the second half. But Loyola rallied to send the game into OT and won the title on a last-second rebound and basket by Vic Rouse.\n3/13/1976 \u2013 Notre Dame 79, Cincinnati 78: Facing No. 7 Notre Dame in the NCAA tournament, the No. 15 Bearcats had led the entire game and were inbounding under the Irish basket with eight seconds left. The Bearcats were called for a five-second violation, in part for their signal for a timeout being missed by the official. Notre Dame would get the ball and score with two seconds remaining to escape with the victory.\n12/21/1981 \u2013 Cincinnati 75, Bradley 73: This contest is still listed as the longest game of NCAA Division I history, reaching seven overtimes. Reserve forward Doug Schloemer hit the decisive shot, a left-wing 15-footer with one second remaining in the seventh overtime. If he had missed that jump shot, it would have gone to an eighth overtime.\n12/12/1983 \u2013 Kentucky 24, Cincinnati 11: It what became known as the \"stall game\", first year coach Tony Yates had his players go into a four-corner spread and waste the clock. Trying to limit the pain from the No. 2 Wildcats, boos rang out for most of the game and Kentucky refused to reschedule a series with Cincinnati after the end of the contract. This game was a big factor that lead to the introduction of the shot clock for the 1985\u201386 season.\n12/12/1984 \u2013 Cincinnati 69, UAB 67: No. 17 UAB had a one-point lead, but in the waning seconds, Tony Wilson, who was on a track scholarship, hit a 54-foot shot beyond half-court at the buzzer to give Cincinnati a 2-point win at Riverfront Coliseum.\n11/25/1989 \u2013 Cincinnati 66, Minnesota 64: It was the school's first game under Bob Huggins, in their new arena, the Shoemaker Center. Walk-on Steve Sanders, who was also the school's football team's wide receiver for four years, hit the buzzer-beating three-pointer to give UC a 66\u201364 win over No. 20 Minnesota.\n01/23/1993 \u2013 Cincinnati 40, UAB 38: The No. 9 Bearcats were heavily favored playing at home vs an 11\u20137 UAB team. It was an ugly, very low-scoring affair, where UAB led at halftime 15\u201311. In a tie game with seconds left, Corie Blount for UC had his shot blocked. It was kicked around and Nick Van Exel recovered it to put up a long two-pointer at the buzzer. Nothing but net. Cats won 40\u201338.\n12/17/1994 \u2013 Cincinnati 81, Wyoming 80: UC trailed Wyoming all game, but when down 2 in the final seconds, LaZelle Durden put up a 3-point attempt as the final horn sounded. He was fouled, but hit all three free throws with no time on the clock. UC won, 81\u201380, and Durden's 45 points were the most by a Bearcat in 34 years.\n03/12/1995 \u2013 Cincinnati 67, St. Louis 65: LaZelle Durden fired in the game-winning three-pointer with 1.2 seconds to play in the conference championship game over Saint Louis, giving the Bearcats a 67\u201365 victory and clinching an NCAA Tournament berth.\n02/11/1996 \u2013 Arizona, 79, Cincinnati 76: The Bearcats had the ball under their own hoop in a tie game vs Arizona with just a few seconds left. Miles Simon stripped the ball from Danny Fortson, and hit a three-quarter-court buzzer-beater to beat UC, 79\u201376.\n02/06/1997 \u2013 Cincinnati 65, Tulane 64: The game was tied at 63 with 2 seconds left, and UC had the ball. Bobby Brannan threw the ball the length of the court. Danny Fortson made the catch near the hoop and laid it in with 0.2 seconds remaining. The majority of the Bearcats bench stormed the court in excitement, thinking the game was over. Cincinnati was given a technical foul for the incident, awarding Tulane two free throws and the ball. Honeycutt only made one of two free throws, and Tulane was unable to score with 0.2 seconds left. Cincinnati won by one.\n02/19/1998 \u2013 Cincinnati 93, UAB 76: All-American Ruben Patterson was awoken at 6:00 in the morning by Bob Huggins. The coach broke the news to him that his mother had a heart attack overnight and died. Patterson played the game that night anyway, after spending all day crying. He scored a career-high 32 points in a 93\u201376 win over UAB.\n03/15/1998 \u2013 West Virginia 75, Cincinnati 74: Cincinnati took a 2-point lead with 7.1 seconds remaining against West Virginia in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Jarrod West of WV then banked in a 30-foot three-pointer with 0.8 seconds left, a shot that was tipped by Ruben Patterson. West Virginia advanced to the Sweet Sixteen with a 75\u201374 win.\n11/29/1998 \u2013 Cincinnati 77, Duke 75: No. 14 Cincinnati took on No. 1 Duke in the Great Alaska Shootout championship. In a tie game with 3 seconds left, Cincinnati ran a \"hook-and-ladder\" type play, that had Kenyon Martin hit an open Melvin Levett sprinting towards the hoop. Levett dunked the ball with one second left, and the Bearcats won, 77\u201375. As of the 2019 season, it is their lone win vs a No. 1 team.\n03/02/2000 \u2013 Cincinnati 66, DePaul 64: DePaul led the No. 2 Bearcats by 17, and by 10 with under 4 minutes remaining. The National POY Kenyon Martin took over, scoring 5 straight field goals for UC and had 2 key blocks down the stretch. With the game tied at 62, freshman DerMarr Johnson hit the game-winning jumper with 2.7 seconds left.\n02/22/2002 \u2013 Cincinnati 63, Marquette 62: 9th-ranked Marquette led No. 4 Cincinnati by 4 with 30 seconds remaining. Steve Logan hit a three-pointer with 22 seconds left, then after a missed one-and-one free throw by Dwyane Wade, Donald Little hit a jumper with 3 seconds remaining. Cincinnati won 63\u201362 in their biggest win of the season.\n03/08/2006 \u2013 Syracuse 74, Cincinnati 73: In the first round of the Big East tournament, the Bearcats led by one with 8.3 seconds remaining. Devan Downey of UC was at the line shooting two free throws. After making the first, he missed the second. Trailing by 2, Gerry McNamara of Syracuse came down and hit a running one-handed three pointer with 0.5 seconds left, giving Syracuse a one-point win. Cincinnati, who was a bubble team, just barely missed the NCAA tournament (even with a Joe Lunardi prediction of a 9 seed on the morning of Selection Sunday), snapping their streak of 14 straight appearances.\n3/11/2010 \u2013 West Virginia 54, Cincinnati 51: The Bearcats needed a marquee win to shore up a borderline NCAA tournament at-large profile and they would get the opportunity against #6 West Virginia and their former Coach Bob Huggins in the Big East Quarterfinals. With the score tied, the Bearcats were able to force WVU into a shot clock violation with 6.4 seconds left, giving them the final possession from under the opposing team's baseline. Captain Deonta Vaughn would inbounds to sophomore Dion Dixon, who the Mountaineers were able to overwhelm near halfcourt - causing him to dribble the ball off his leg and out of bounds. On the ensuing possession, tournament MVP Da'Sean Butler would receive the ball with 3.1 seconds left and unleash a highly contested 3 pointer which banked in and sent West Virginia to their eventual Big East tournament championship and the Bearcats to the NIT.\n12/10/2011 \u2013 Xavier 76, Cincinnati 53: The 2011 rivalry game with Xavier ended in a bench-clearing brawl between the two teams, with the officials calling an end to the game with less than 10 seconds left. For more details, see 2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl.\n03/09/2012 \u2013 Cincinnati 71, Syracuse 68: Unranked Cincinnati took on No. 2 Syracuse (31\u20131) in the Big East tournament semifinals. The Bearcats were hot out of the gate, hitting 8 of their first 10 three-point attempts and jumping out to a 25\u20138 lead. Syracuse came roaring back in the game, getting it to a one-point game with a few seconds left. A Justin Jackson dunk with a second remaining capped the Bearcats 71\u201368 win, the school's highest-ranked victory since 1998.\n03/19/2015 \u2013 Cincinnati 66, Purdue 65: 8-seeded Cincinnati and 9-seeded Purdue met for the first time in the NCAA tournament in this round of 64 matchup. In a game that was close the majority of the way, Purdue began to pull away down the stretch. Down 7 with 48 seconds to go, the Bearcats hit a three pointer, forced a turnover, and made an and-one layup, all within 6 seconds to cut it to one. Down two with 7 seconds left, sophomore Troy Caupain drove to the hoop and hit a floater that dramatically spun around the rim, hung on the rim for a second, and fell in, as time expired. In overtime, UC prevailed 66\u201365, to advance to the round of 32 against an undefeated Kentucky team.\n03/11/2016 \u2013 UConn 104, Cincinnati 97: In a 4-overtime thriller for the ages, Cincinnati and UConn faced off in the AAC Tournament. In the closing seconds of the 3rd overtime, in a tie game, UC guard Kevin Johnson drained a long 3-pointer with 0.8 seconds left to take a three-point lead. In a desperation heave, Jalen Adams of UConn banked in a 75-footer to extend the game. UConn outscored Cincinnati in the 4th overtime, 16\u20139, advancing in the conference tournament in which they would end up winning.\n03/18/2016 \u2013 St. Joe's 78, Cincinnati 76: In the first round of the NCAA tournament, 9-seeded Cincinnati took on 8-seeded St. Joe's. After the Cats clawed back from a second half deficit of 12 points, St. Joe's drained a 3-pointer with under 10 seconds left to take a two-point lead. Cincy guard Troy Caupain drove the length of the floor to the hoop, and got the ball to Octavius Ellis after being swarmed by a double-team. Ellis attempted to quickly slam it home, only to discover his dunk was 0.1 seconds too late. Time expired. St. Joe's advanced.\n03/04/2018 \u2013 Cincinnati 62, Wichita State 61 : The 10th ranked Bearcats met the 11th ranked Shockers at their home arena on senior night - facing a team that regularly played six seniors - for a chance to win the American Athletic Conference regular season championship outright. In a modern classic under the gaze of a hostile sellout crowd, both squads went back and forth throughout the matchup. Down 1 with 9.3 seconds left under their own basket, Wichita State whipped it around to senior three point ace: Conner Frankamp. UC anticipated the mismatch with sophomore Center Nysier Brooks on the perimeter. Frankamp's potential game-winner missed wide with State corralling the offensive rebound; however, fellow UC sophomore Jarron Cumberland laid down some suffocating defense under the basket, causing their putback to miss off the backside of the backboard as time expired. This gave UC its second regular season AAC title and first outright.\n03/11/2018 \u2013 Cincinnati 56, Houston 55  : Cincinnati met the nationally ranked Houston Cougars for the third time this season, having split the regular season 1-1. The rubber match came in the finals of the American Athletic Conference tournament, with both schools seeking their first ever AAC tournament title. Gary Clark and company were able to cut down the nets for the first time in their collegiate careers, as Houston's star Rob Gray turned the ball over on the game's final possession.\n03/18/2018 \u2013 Nevada 75, Cincinnati 73: With the \"South bracket\" in the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament shaping up in Cincinnati's favor, the Bearcats seemed prime for continued March success as they led Nevada by 22 points with 11 minutes remaining. Nevada mounted a furious comeback, scoring 16 straight points over the next 3 minutes. The game continued to be touch and go for the remainder of the half, with an overwhelming amount of foul calls against the Bearcats. With 9 seconds left, Nevada took their first and only lead of the game at 75\u201373. The Bearcats dribbled the full length of the court but bobbled the ball and never got a clean look as time expired and Nevada tied the second largest comeback to-date in NCAA Tournament history.\n03/17/2019 - Cincinnati 69, Houston 57: After being beaten twice by the Cougars in 2019 - the second an embarrassing 85\u201369 home loss on Senior Day a week earlier that cost them a share of the AAC regular season crown - the Bearcats got a third shot at the outright AAC regular season champs, but were thought to be heavy underdogs against the 31-2 Cougars. After defeating SMU (82\u201374) and Wichita State (66\u201363) in the AAC quarterfinals and semifinals respectively, the Bearcats scored a redemptive victory. AAC Player of the year Jarron Cumberland scored 33 points and was named tournament most outstanding player as the Bearcats successfully defended their AAC Tournament Crown and delivered Houston's only double digit loss of the 2018-2019 season.\n03/07/2020 - Cincinnati 64, Temple 63: The Bearcats under new coach John Brannen endured an up and down season - epitomized by a Senior Day where they fell behind underdog Temple by as many as 14 points. Fueled by All-AAC players Jarron Cumberland and Trevon Scott, the Bearcats slowly mounted a comeback - tying the game at 54 with 2:03 left. After a hectic 2 minutes, Temple took the lead on a late 3 with 10 seconds remaining. Out of timeouts, Jarron Cumberland drove down the court but his layup ricocheted off the back iron; however, Trevon Scott heroically made a putback layup in the waning seconds to give the Bearcats a dramatic win. The win ultimately shored up the Bearcats' bubbly tournament resume and gave the Bearcats a share of the AAC regular season title.\n\nRivalries\nXavier\nCincinnati's main basketball rivalry is Xavier University. The two schools play annually in the Skyline Chili Crosstown Shootout. Cincinnati's record in the Shootout is 52\u201340, winning the most recent matchup in 2024.\n\nLouisville\nUC and Louisville were rivals, first playing in 1921, until the 2010\u201313 NCAA conference realignment put the contest on hiatus, as Louisville moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference on July 1, 2014. The rivalry has stretched over the span of four conferences from the Missouri Valley Conference, to the Metro Conference to Conference USA, and more recently in the Big East Conference, which in 2013 was renamed to the American Athletic Conference. The teams have faced off 99 times in series history, with Louisville leading the all-time series 53\u201343. Most notably, Louisville and Cincinnati faced each other twice over the course of the 2011-12 season. UC would upset then No. 17 ranked Louisville at home before facing off again in the 2012 Big East men's basketball tournament championship game, where Louisville would prevail 50\u201344.\n\nMemphis\nFirst playing in 1968, Cincinnati and Memphis have been longtime conference rivals from the Missouri Valley Conference, to the Metro Conference, Great Midwest Conference, Conference USA, and currently in the American Athletic Conference though Cincinnati is scheduled to leave for the Big 12 Conference in 2023. The teams have faced off 86 times in basketball series history, with Cincinnati leading the all-time series 47\u201338.\nFamously, Cincinnati beat Penny Hardaway's Tigers four times in the 1991\u201392 season, including in the Elite Eight on the way to the program's sixth Final Four appearance.\n\nOther rivals\nUC and Dayton have faced off 91 times, with UC leading the all-time series 60\u201331.

Similarly to Dayton, the series was played frequently until it came to a halt in 2011. However, for the 2021\u201322 season the Bearcats announced they would travel to Oxford to play Miami (OH), resuming the series for the first time in a decade, winning 59\u201358.\n\nPostseason history\nNCAA Tournament seeding history\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Bearcats have appeared in the NCAA tournament 33 times.

The arena is on-campus and has a capacity of 12,012 (with room for overflow). It is located in the Myrl H. Shoemaker Center, which was also the name of the arena until 2005, when it was named for Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank. It is still popularly known as \"The Shoe\". The Bearcats held a 42-game home win streak from 1997 to 2000. In the 1999\u20132000 season, every Bearcat home game was sold out. During the Bob Huggins era, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation due to the high decibel levels typical of his tenure.\nOn December 15, 2015, The UC Board of Trustees approved an $87-million, privately funded renovation of Fifth Third Arena. Proposed improvements to the facility, include the creation of a 360-degree seating bowl, new HD scoreboard, ribbon boards, sound system, an LED lighting system which will allow for enhanced gameday presentation, new restroom and concession facilities, a new upper-level concourse with its own fan amenities, expanded food and beverage options and a new main entrance and plaza with centralized ticketing and guest services. Construction began in April 2017 and was completed in fall 2018. During the 2017\u201318 school year, men's basketball home games were moved to BB&T Arena at Northern Kentucky University in Highland Heights, Kentucky, while women's basketball and volleyball home games were moved to the campus of St. Ursula Academy. The Bearcats christened the newly renovated arena in a rare home game vs. Ohio State on November 7, 2018.\nThe Bearcats have a 439\u201392 (.827) overall record in Fifth Third Arena as of the 2021\u201322 season.\n\nSee also\nUniversity of Cincinnati\nCincinnati Bearcats\nFifth Third Arena\nWes Miller\nNCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by coaches\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nNiesen, Joan (November 6, 2017). \"Cincinnati Bearcats\".

    "biography": "The Clemson Tigers men's basketball team is a college basketball program that represents Clemson University and competes in the NCAA Division I. Clemson is a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nClemson sponsored its first men's basketball team in 1911\u201312, winning its first conference championship in 1939 and the ACC regular season in 1990. The Tigers have never won the ACC basketball tournament since its inception in 1953.  The Tigers have reached the NCAA tournament 15 times in the modern era (1980, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021, 2024, 2025) since the tournament expansion in 1980, advancing to the NCAA Sweet 16 five times (1980, 1990, 1997, 2018, 2024), with their best performance reaching the Elite Eight twice in 1980 and 2024.\nClemson's home court is Littlejohn Coliseum. It has been the scene of 55 Clemson wins over ranked teams (23 in the Top 10) since 1968, including a victory over #1 Duke in 1980, a 75\u201365 victory over #1 North Carolina in 2001, and a 74\u201347 victory over #3 Duke in 2009. The Clemson basketball programs have won roughly 75% of their games in Littlejohn, making it one of the ACC's toughest road venues.\nClemson's current head coach is Brad Brownell.\n\nTeam history\nClemson's basketball history had an unusual beginning. The Tigers' first two basketball games were both played in Greenville, South Carolina on February 9, 1912, a 46\u201312 win at Furman, followed by a 78\u20136 victory over the Butler Guards later that evening. Brothers John and Frank Erwin scored a combined 74 points in their second game; John Erwin's 58 points still stand as Clemson's single-game scoring record, unique in college basketball for not being broken in over a century since the program's inaugural day. Clemson won its first seven games in the program's history, the longest streak to open a program among the current 15 ACC schools. Former Pittsburgh Nationals player Frank Dobson was Clemson's first basketball coach, taking the Tigers to a 13\u20135 record in the first two seasons.\n\nSouthern Conference\nThe Tigers began play in the Southern Conference in 1921, and 1922\u201323 had an 11\u20136 finish. Josh Cody coached for five seasons, the longest tenure for a Clemson Basketball coach in the first 25 years. In 1928\u201329, the Tigers won 15 games, a school record, and then followed that with a 16\u20139 mark. Cody pulled off the first huge upset in Clemson basketball history when the Tigers defeated Adolph Rupp's 10\u20131 Kentucky Wildcats, 29\u201326, at Clemson on Valentine's Day in 1931. From 1931 to 1940, Joe Davis coached Clemson to 101 victories, including 44 wins on the road. Davis still has the best winning percentage in Clemson history on the road and led the Tigers to a 15\u20133 (.833) mark in 1934\u201335. In the 1938\u201339 season, the Tigers won 10 of their last 11 games to close the regular season. Banks McFadden, eventual All-American in both football and basketball, averaged 11.8 points per game to lead the team as the starting pivot to four victories. It was an incredible run in the tournament as Clemson beat North Carolina, 44\u201343, Wake Forest, 30\u201328, Davidson 49\u201333 and Maryland 39\u201327 to clinch the Southern Conference title. McFadden's best year as coach was the 1951\u201352 season when the Tigers were 17\u20137 overall and 11\u20134 in the Conference.\n\nAtlantic Coast Conference\nIn 1953, Clemson became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. In the 1954\u201355 season, Bill Yarborough averaged 28.3 points per game, 4th best in the nation and best in the ACC. In 1958, Vince Yockel became the first Clemson player to make first-team All-ACC. Press Maravich, father of basketball legend Pete Maravich, coached the Tigers to a 96\u201394 double overtime victory against a #8 NC State team. Jim Brennan became the first Clemson player to make the first-team All-ACC Tournament in 1962 with 34 points against #8 Duke in the semifinals before losing to Billy Packer and the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, 77\u201366. In 1963\u201364, coach Bobby Roberts guided the Tigers to an 8\u20136 record in the ACC. The season included the only regular season sweep of North Carolina in school history. Roberts beat the Tar Heels and Dean Smith, 66\u201364, in double overtime at Clemson to open the season and beat them again, 97\u201390, in double overtime in Charlotte at the North\u2013South Doubleheader. In 1966\u201367. Clemson won seven straight ACC games, including consecutive wins over Wake Forest, #14 Duke, North Carolina State and #4 North Carolina. It was the first sweep of \"the North Carolina ACC schools\" in ACC history. Clemson finished with a 17\u20138 record and a 9\u20135 record in the ACC. Randy Mahaffey was a first-team All-ACC selection who became Clemson's first professional player. His teammate Jim Sutherland averaged 17 points a game and was the first Clemson athlete in any sport to win the Jim Weaver Award as the ACC's top scholar-athlete.\nIn the 1970s, Tree Rollins ushered in a new era in Clemson basketball when he matriculated to Tigertown for the 1973\u201374 season. He changed the image of Clemson basketball more than any other player. At 7\u20132, he was a shot-blocking phenomenon who burst on the national scene in his second game when he had 22 points, 20 rebounds and nine blocked shots against St. John's. Rollins started 110 games in a row, which was a national record then. His sophomore year, 1974\u201375, he joined forces with Skip Wise to take Clemson to its first top 20 final ranking and its first postseason NIT tournament bid. The Tigers defeated 3rd ranked Maryland, 10th ranked North Carolina and 4th ranked NC State at home. Wise was named first-team All-ACC and the first true freshman in league history to obtain that honor.\n\nBill Foster\nIn 1975, Bill Foster was brought in to build the program further. He had an impeccable reputation and came from a UNC Charlotte program he helped advance.  When Tree Rollins decided not to turn professional, Foster coached the Tigers to a 22\u20136 record, the program's ninth straight year with an improved winning percentage. Before his final game, Rollins had his #30 jersey retired, the first athlete in Clemson history so honored. It was a fitting way to honor Rollins, who averaged a double-double for four years and is still first in ACC history in blocked shots, before starting his 18-year career in the NBA. Bill Foster did a remarkable job in keeping Clemson at a winning level. He won 100 games in his first 147, still fifth in ACC history in terms of the fewest games required to get 100 wins. He could find diamonds in the rough that kept Clemson competitive in the ACC: Bobby Conrad, Horace Grant, Harvey Grant, & Larry Nance an eventual All-West regional choice in the 1980 NCAA tournament and NBA All-Star. Foster's 1979\u201380 team defeated six top 20 teams during the year, including #1 ranked Duke on January 9, 1980, in overtime, 87\u201382. Clemson went to the NCAA Tournament defeating Danny Ainge and BYU in Round 2 before being eliminated by Larry Brown and UCLA in the Elite Eight.\n\nCliff Ellis\nCliff Ellis became the winningest coach in Clemson basketball history on a total victories basis (177\u2013128). He took the Tigers to eight post-season tournaments, including three NCAA tournaments. He coached a record 25-win season in 1987, with ACC Player of the Year and future NBA champion Horace Grant. Ellis coached Clemson to the ACC regular season title in 1990, with the Tigers posting a 24\u20138 record that year behind Dale Davis and Elden Campbell, ending in a last-second shot by UConn in the Sweet 16. Ellis set 33 Clemson coaching records, including ACC regular season victories, victories at home and home winning percentage. The Tigers won 22 games over the top 25 teams in Ellis' ten years at Clemson, including an upset of 12th-ranked Florida State in the 1993 ACC Tournament and a victory over #2 North Carolina in 1994. Ellis was also named ACC Coach-of-the-Year in 1987 and 1990, the only Clemson coach to win that award.\n\nRick Barnes\nRick Barnes was the first coach in Clemson history to take the Tigers to the NCAA Tournament three consecutive years. Barnes coached Clemson into post-season play every year of his tenure and to the NCAA in 1996, 1997, and 1998. The Tigers' top season was his third year, when he coached the Tigers to a 16\u20131 start and a #2 national ranking. In the season, he opened with a 79\u201371 overtime victory against defending National Champion Kentucky. The team ended the season 23\u201310 and ranked #8 in the final USA Today poll. Picked last in the ACC before his first season, he shocked the basketball world by winning his first ten games, including a 75\u201370 victory over 9th-ranked Duke in Cameron Indoor Stadium. In his second season, he featured an 18\u201311 record, including Clemson's first-ever ACC Tournament victory over #20 North Carolina. The Tigers were ranked fifth in the nation in the preseason poll of 1997\u20131998, an example of the level of respect that Barnes had brought back to the program. His fiery on-the-floor interactions with Dean Smith and the teams' physical style of play made him a basketball fan favorite. Clemson defeated three top-25 teams in 1997\u20131998, including sixth-ranked South Carolina. Barnes concluded his four years with a 74\u201348 record, a 60.7 percent winning mark before leaving for the University of Texas.\n\nLarry Shyatt\nBarnes' assistant Larry Shyatt, who was a part of Clemson's success in the three seasons prior, took over as head coach for five seasons from 1998 to 2003.  Shyatt led the Tigers to a 20-win season in his first season (20\u201315). The Tigers advanced to the 1999 NIT Championship Game before losing to California by one point, 60\u201361.  At the time, Shyatt became only the fourth first-year coach in Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) history to guide his team to a 20-win season. Also during his time as head coach at Clemson, the 2000\u201301 team set a school record for three-point field goals in a season and recorded one of the biggest wins in school history with a 75\u201365 win over No. 1 ranked North Carolina on February 18, 2001, ending an 18-game winning streak for the Tar Heels.\n\nOliver Purnell\nAfter several lackluster seasons and renovations to Littlejohn Coliseum, Oliver Purnell rebuilt the program steadily, improving each subsequent season. The trademark of Purnell's teams was full-court pressure defense. In 2008, he guided the Tigers to a third-place 10\u20136 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference and a runner-up position in the ACC Tournament in Charlotte, losing to North Carolina by 5 points. The 2008\u201309 season was record-breaking on many fronts. Purnell's team finished with a 23\u20139 record, a .719 winning percentage, and a No. 24 final ranking in the Associated Press poll. Clemson's victims that season were #3 Duke, who lost to the #10 Tigers by a score of 74\u201347 at Littlejohn Coliseum. It was the largest margin of victory ever for Clemson against a ranked opponent. Coaching players such as Cliff Hammonds, K.C. Rivers, and Trevor Booker, Purnell finished with a record of 138\u201388 and guided the Tigers to 3 NCAA appearances.\n\nBrad Brownell\nBrad Brownell is the current Clemson head basketball coach. In his first season in 2010, Brownell guided the Tigers to a 4th-place ACC finish and a 2nd-round finish in the NCAA Tournament and set a record with 22 wins (9 ACC), the most ever by a rookie coach. Jerai Grant and Demontez Stitt became the first scholarship players in school history to be consistent contributors to four straight NCAA Tournament teams. Brownell's second team went 16\u201315 and 8\u20138 in ACC play, a record fifth straight season the Tigers were .500 or better in conference games, defeating three teams that advanced to the NCAA Tournament, including NC State.  In 2013, the Tigers suffered a 13\u201318 overall record. Still, they were impressive in several statistical categories, yielding just 60.1 points per game, finishing 2nd in the ACC in Scoring Defense, and setting a record for fewest turnovers.  Brownell's defensive style continued to stifle teams into the 2014 season, as the Tigers, led by blocking and scoring leader K. J. McDaniels, was ranked 2nd in the nation in Scoring Defense (56.8 ppg), which helped elevate Clemson to a 72\u201359 upset of #16 Duke on January 11.  The Tigers were seeded 6th in the 2014 ACC tournament and advanced to the semifinals of the NIT at Madison Square Garden.  On January 16, 2016, the Clemson Tigers defeated #8 Miami, marking the first time Clemson has defeated three consecutive top-25 opponents.  In the two games prior, Clemson defeated #16 Louisville and #9 Duke.  Brownell was announced after the 2016\u20132017 season to stay as Clemson's head coach with a contract extension until 2021. \nIn 2017\u201318 the Tigers went 25-10 (9-9) and Brownell and the Tigers made their first appearance in the NCAA tournament since 2010\u201311. Clemson would beat #12 seed New Mexico State 79\u201368 and #4 seed Auburn 84\u201353 before losing to #1 seeded Kansas 80\u201376. In the 2019\u201320 season, the Tigers beat #3 Duke at home and North Carolina back to back and won in Chapel Hill for the first time. The Tigers also beat #5 Louisville and #6 Florida State, finished with a 16\u201315 (9\u201311) record, and finished 9th in the ACC. \nThe 2023\u20132024 season proved to be one of the most successful seasons in Clemson history. Led by All-ACC selection PJ Hall and senior guard Chase Hunter, the team boasted ranked non-conference wins over in-state rival South Carolina and Alabama, the latter coming in the ACC\u2014SEC Challenge. Clemson also achieved their second-ever win in Chapel Hill over #3 UNC, the second highest-ranked road win in history for the Tigers, second only to Clemson's win over #2 Maryland in 1976. The Tigers earned a 6 seed in the ACC tournament, only to fall in their first game to 12 seed Boston College. The Tigers were selected for their first NCAA tournament appearance since 2021, as a 6 seed. Rebounding from their disappointing ACC tournament finish, the Tigers earned their first Elite Eight appearance since 1980, beating three favored teams in 11 seed New Mexico, 3 seed Baylor, and 2 seed Arizona before falling to 4-seed Alabama in the Elite Eight. Clemson's 2024 Elite Eight finish is Brownell's best as a head coach, and Clemson's best finish since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.\nThe 2024\u201325 season was another very successful season for the Tigers. The team was led by senior guard Chase Hunter and senior forward Ian Schieffelin. The team posted an early season non-conference upset of the #4 ranked Kentucky Wildcats during the ACC/SEC Challenge, defeating them 70\u201366. Clemson would post an 18\u20132 (.900) ACC regular season record, the best in its history, featuring wins over North Carolina 85\u201365 and #2 Duke 77\u201371 matching their highest ranked opponent to ever be defeated with the only other instance coming against #2 Maryland in 1976. Clemson earned the 3 seed in the 2025 ACC Tournament where they defeated SMU in the quarterfinals 57\u201354 but ultimately being eliminated in the semifinals falling to Louisville 76-73.

    "biography": "Cleveland State Vikings men's basketball is the men's college basketball team that represents Cleveland State University. Prior to rebranding from Fenn College, they were known as the Fenn College Foxes. Cleveland State has been in Division I since 1972 and are currently led by first-year head coach Rob Summers. They have been a member of the Horizon League since 1994. Cleveland State was formerly in the Mid-Continent Conference (1982\u20131994). Prior to 1982, Cleveland State was an independent program. The Vikings have appeared in three NCAA Tournaments, most recently in 2021. In 1986, Cleveland State advanced to the NCAA Sweet 16.\n\nHistory\nThe 1985\u201386 season is arguably the most memorable in Vikings history, as they achieved the improbable in becoming the first ever 14th seeded team to make it to the Sweet Sixteen of the  1986 NCAA tournament. Coach Kevin Mackey's squad, led by Ken 'Mouse' McFadden and Eric Mudd, upset Bobby Knight's 3rd seeded Indiana Hoosiers, by a final of 83-79. Following a 75-69 second round win against 6th seeded St.Joseph's, the Vikings would ultimately lose to Navy 71-70 on a clutch basket in the waning seconds by future Hall of Famer, David Robinson. Cleveland State would qualify for the NIT Tournament the following two seasons, but went 23 seasons until returning to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nOn Monday, December 15, 2008, Cleveland State had their biggest regular season victory in school history, upsetting the #11 Syracuse Orange, 72-69, on a last-second, three-quarter court shot from senior guard Cedric Jackson. It was CSU's third-ever win over a Top 25 ranked opponent, and first ever on the road. They would pick up their fourth and fifth wins over Top 25 opponents later that same season when they won at #17 Butler in the championship game of the Horizon League Tournament 57-54, and then in the first round of the 2009 NCAA tournament when, as the 13th seeded team in the Midwest bracket, they routed 4th seeded and #12 Wake Forest by a final score of 84-69.\n\nRecords\nRecord versus Horizon League\nRecords vs. Horizon League schools as of the end of the 2020\u20132021 school year.\n\nRecord versus Ohio schools\nRecords vs. Ohio schools as of the end of the 2015\u20132016 school year.\n\nIndividual career records\nCleveland State wins vs. the AP Top 25\nAwards\nAMCU/Mid Continent Player of the Year\n\nKen McFadden \u2013 1988\nAMCU/Mid Continent Coach of the Year\n\nKevin Mackey - 1985, 1986\nMike Boyd - 1993\nAMCU/Mid Continent Newcomer of the Year\n\nClinton Smith - 1985\nSam Mitchell, 1993\nHorizon League Player of the Year\n\nNorris Cole - 2011\nHorizon League Newcomer of the Year\n\nDamon Stringer - 2000\nBryn Forbes - 2013\nJe\u2019Shawn Stevenson - 2025\nHorizon League Defensive Player of the Year\n\nCedric Jackson - 2009\nNorris Cole - 2011\nTre Gomillion - 2021\nD'Moi Hodge - 2022\nHorizon League Sixth Man of the Year\n\nJon Harris - 2014\nChase Robinson - 2025\nHorizon League Coach of the Year\n\nGary Waters - 2008\nDennis Gates - 2020, 2021\nHoopDirt.com Division I Coach of the Year\n\nDennis Gates - 2021\n\nAttendance\nYear-by-year\nLargest Crowds\nWolstein Center\nWoodling Gym\nPublic Auditorium\nNBA draft history\n8 total NBA draft picks.\nRegular Draft\n\nRecord by year\nConference tournaments\nAMCU\n1988, No tournament held\n1989, Ineligible for tournament\n1990, Ineligible for tournament\n\nHorizon League\n1996, Did not qualify as 9th overall in the conference.\n\n2019, Did not qualify as 9th overall in the conference.\n\nPostseason history\nNCAA Division I Tournament history\nCleveland State has made three appearances in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, having a record of 3\u20133.\n\nNIT results\nCleveland State has appeared in the National Invitation Tournament six times, with the Vikings having a record of 3\u20136.\n\nCBI results\nThe Vikings have received three College Basketball Invitational (CBI) berths.

  "Colorado Buffaloes": {
    "biography": "The Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball team represents the University of Colorado Boulder. The team competes in the Big 12 Conference of NCAA Division I.  They are currently coached by Tad Boyle.\nThe Buffaloes have competed in sixteen NCAA Tournaments, most recently appearing in 2024. Colorado made it to the Final Four in 1942 and 1955. Colorado has played in eleven National Invitation Tournaments, winning the tournament in 1940 and making the semifinals in 1991 and 2011. The Buffs won the Pac-12 conference tournament in 2012, their first season as a member.\n\nTeam history\nThe Silver & Gold become Buffaloes\nThe Colorado Men's Basketball team was initially known as the Silver and Gold, and began play on January 10, 1901, and beat State Prep School 34\u201310.  While unaffiliated their first few seasons, the school joined the Rocky Mountain Conference in 1909.  From 1902 to 1935, the school racked up a 200\u2013151 record.\nIn 1934, the Silver and Gold became known as the Buffaloes.  CU students rented a buffalo calf to cheer the team on for the final football game that year, and the nickname stuck with the school since then.\n\nThe Frosty Cox era\nThe first coaching star for CU was Forrest B. \"Frosty\" Cox.  Cox spent 13 years on the sidelines from 1936 to 1950.  In his second season with the school, the Buffaloes joined the Mountain States Conference, where they would proceed to win four MSC titles.  Under Cox, the Buffs had quite a bit of success\u2014both individually and as a team.  Cox had four All-Americans during his time with the Buffs \u2013 Jack Harvey (1939 & 1940), Jim Willcoxon (1939), Bob Doll (1942), and Leason McCloud (1942).  Cox lead the team to three NCAA tournament bids and two NIT bids while in Boulder.\nArguably the greatest team in CU Basketball history was the 1940 squad which not only got invited to the NCAA tournament but to the NIT tournament as well.  The Buffs won the more prestigious at the time NIT Tournament, which leads some to claim that the 1940 team were National Champs. In 1942, the Buffs lost in the NCAA Tournament championship game to the Stanford Cardinals, which is the school's all-time best finish in that tournament.\nIn 1947, the Buffs left the Mountain States Conference and joined the Big Seven Conference.  When Cox concluded his CU career, he had the best win\u2013loss percentage (62.3%) of any CU coach who coached for more than one season.\n\n\"The Big Burd\" rules the court\nAfter Cox left CU, Horace \"Bebe\" Lee took over as the Buffs head coach. He led the school to two NCAA Tournament bids, including a Third Place finish in the 1955 NCAA tournament.  However, the star of this era was Burdette \"Burdie\" Haldorson. Also known as \"The Big Burd,\" Haldorson was arguably the best player in Colorado Men's Basketball history.  An All-American whose number is retired at CU, Haldorson was named to All-Big 7 Conference team two times and is also a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, The Colorado Sports Hall of Fame, the University of Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame, and the Pac-12 Basketball Hall of Honor.  He also won two gold medals with USA Basketball (1956 & 1960).\nIn 1955, Haldorson led the Big 7 Conference in scoring with 23.9 points per game as he led the Buffs to the third-place finish in the 1955 NCAA Tournament.\n\n\"Sox\" Walseth leads The way\nIn 1956, CU named former player Russell \"Sox\" Walseth as their head coach.  Walseth graduated from CU in 1948 as a three-time letterman in both basketball and baseball for the Buffaloes, and came back to coach after stints at High School (Bakersfield, California) and South Dakota State.  \"Sox\" led the team to three Big 8 titles (the school joined the conference in 1958) and three NCAA tournament bids.  In both the 1961\u201362 & 1962\u201363 seasons, the Buffs reached the second round of the NCAA tournament before being eliminated by Cincinnati.\n\"Sox\" had two All-Americans while at CU\u2014Ken Charlton (1963) and Cliff Meely (1971).  Another key performer on the successful 1961\u201362 team, which beat Kansas to take the Big Eight Conference title before proceeding to the NCAA tournament, was Wilky Gilmore. Charlton and Gilmore were both named to the All Big-Eight team that year.\nSomewhat later in Walseth's tenure as coach, another standout at Boulder was Scott Wedman \u2013 a sharp-shooting forward from Denver's Mullen High School.  Wedman made a huge mark on the CU record books as he led the team in scoring and rebounding for two seasons, free throw percentage for one season and field goal percentage all three years he played at CU.  Those numbers placed him seventh in career scoring, sixth in rebounding and eighth in field goal percentage in CU history at the time he left the school.  He also was the highest draft pick in school history, going 2nd overall in the ABA Draft to the Memphis Sounds (he was also drafted 6th overall in the NBA draft by the KC-Omaha Kings).  Wedman went on to play 12 years in the NBA.\nWhen he retired after twenty seasons, \"Sox\" was the all-time winningest coach in CU history with a 261\u2013245 record.  Four years later, he came back to coach the women's team to a 77\u201321 record, including an incredible 43\u20130 home record, before retiring again.  In 1996, the CU Event Center basketball court was named after him, so the Buffs all play on \"Sox Walseth Court\" now.\n\nCliff Meely\nThe star of the program under \"Sox\" Walseth was undoubtedly Cliff Meely.  Walseth often called Meely \"the most complete player\" he had ever coached, and Meely set sixteen school records while playing for the Buffaloes and eight Big 8 Conference records.\nMeely is the school's all-time leader in points and rebounds per game, and was named an All-American during the 1971 season.  The list of accolades he received while in Boulder is numerous, but along with being an All-American, in 1969 he was named both Big 8 Player of the Year and Big 8 Sophomore of the Year.  In fact, all three years he was at Colorado he was named to the All-Big 8 First Team.  Because of his dominant play, he was not only named to the 1970s Big 8 All-Decade First Team, but in 1996 he was named to the AP's All-time Big 8 Conference Basketball first team along with Wayman Tisdale (Oklahoma), Danny Manning (Kansas), Jo Jo White (Kansas) and Rolando Blackman (Kansas State).\nColorado has retired the #20 that he wore while in Boulder.\n\nIndividual talents lead the way\nThe lackluster results of Walseth's latter tenure would become the norm for Colorado over the next two decades. From 1977\u201378 to 1995\u201396, the Buffs would only have four winning seasons, and only once would even get to .500 in Big Eight play.\nWhile the Buffs struggled record-wise in the '80s and early '90s, they did have a few individual standouts that brought the team national attention.  From 1980 to 1984, the Buffs were led by Jay Humphries, an exciting guard who made his mark all over CU's record book in just those three seasons.  On offense, he became the school's all-time assist leader and also finished fourth all-time in scoring.  Even with that though, Humphries was best known for his defense.  Humphries is the school's all-time leader in thefts and led the nation in steals in 1982\u201383 with 115.  Humphries was twice named Honorable Mention All-American (1982\u201383 & 1983\u201384) before being drafted by the Phoenix Suns with the thirteenth pick of the NBA draft. A teammate of Humphries in high school and at Colorado was post player Vince Kelley. Kelley also played with the Buffaloes from 1980 to 1984 and finished third all-time in career rebounds at CU. Kelly graduated in 1984 and played professionally in Australia and Portugal.\nAfter starting out the '80s with talent like Humphries and Kelley, the Buffs found a way to round the decade out with two more stars to lead the team.  Shaun Vandiver was a transfer from Hutchinson CC who only played three years in Boulder, but when it was all said & done finished as the school's all-time leader in field goal percentage and was the school's second leading scorer & rebounder in history.  For his work, he was named Honorable Mention All-American in 1989\u201390 and was named Big Eight tournament MVP from a losing team after leading the 8th seeded Buffs to the Tournament Championship game before falling short \u2013 the first eight seed to ever make the championship game.\nVandiver wasn't alone on the team though as he had guard Stevie Wise there to help lead the way.  Wise played 119 games for the Buffs, the fifth most in school history. He was known for being one of CU's all-time great 3 point specialists and he holds numerous CU shooting marks.  He finished his time as the number three scorer in school history and is still in the top 10 for assists in school history.  Wise & Vandiver led the team on their run to the 1991 NIT Final Four.  It was the school's first postseason appearance since 1969, and when it was said & done, they got to cut down the nets in front of a standing room only crowd at the Events Center before heading to the NIT Final Four in NYC where they ended up third.\nThe next player to make his mark on the record books was Donnie Boyce.  The Illinois product spent four years at CU and when he left he was the school's all-time leading scorer with 1,995 points.  He was the first Buff to lead the team in scoring all four years at CU, and only the second Buff to ever do it.  While Boyce was lighting it up, the team struggled.  It appeared that Boyce was finally going to get to play in a postseason tournament in 1995, but he broke his leg in the opening round of the Big Eight tournament against Oklahoma.  The team went on to earn an NIT bid\u2013their first postseason bid of any sort since 1969\u2013but he was unable to play.\n\nThe Chauncey Billups years\nThe most beloved player in school history, Chauncey Billups is usually the first person that people think of when they think Colorado basketball. The three-time winner of Colorado's Mr. Basketball award and a member of the McDonald's All-American team his senior year, the Denver native could have gone anywhere in the nation to play college ball. Even though it was obvious he wouldn't be staying for the entire four years due to a pro career calling his name, he had no shortage of suitors. With all of that, he decided to stay close to home and enroll at CU.\nIn his first year at Colorado, he set a school record for points scored by a freshman and was named to the Big 8 All-Freshman team as well as the All-Big 8 Conference Second Team and the Kansas City Star Big 8 team\u2014an honor that was voted on by the players themselves. Unfortunately, Chauncey's first year in Boulder was filled only with individual accolades as the team underperformed and head coach Joe Harrington was relieved of duties. His sophomore year however, Chauncey was able to get the team going. Behind new head coach Ricardo Patton, and in a new conference (the Big 12 Conference), Chauncey at one point had led the Buffs to a 14\u20133 record and the #18 ranking in the nation. This team would make the Buffs' first NCAA Tournament appearance in 28 years, and notched their first winning conference record in 24 years. They would upset Indiana in the first round before losing to North Carolina in the second round. For his work, Chauncey was named not only to the All-Big 12 Conference First Team, but was named an All-American as well.  Chauncey declared for the NBA draft, where he was picked third overall by the Boston Celtics, and he went on to play 17 years in the NBA.\n\nThe Buffs enter The Big 12\nOnce Chauncey left, the Buffs were faced with a rough conference slate, but still managed to have some success behind head coach Ricardo Patton.  Players such as Jaquay Walls (Big 12 All-Newcomer Team) and Jamahl Mosley helped lead the team to back-to-back NIT bids, but things started to improve once David Harrison showed up on campus for the 2001\u201302 season.  Harrison was named to the Big 12 All-Freshman team and lead the school in scoring, while also setting a school record with a field goal percentage of 63.8% \u2013 good enough for third nationally.  Harrison had help though in the form of St\u00e9phane Pelle. Pelle was the first player in 11 years to average a double-double, putting up 12.8 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in the 2001\u201302 season.  The next season, with Harrison & Pelle down low and Michel Morandais coming in to form on the wing, the Buffs won 20 games and capped it off with an NCAA Tournament bid.  They made the NIT the next season after Harrison left early to go into the NBA draft.\n\nNew all-time scoring leaders\nRichard Roby stepped on the CU campus in 2004 and became the first freshman since Chauncey Billups to lead the team in scoring and he ended up joining Donnie Boyce as the only Buffs to lead the team in scoring all four years on campus.  In his sophomore season, Roby & the Buffs won twenty games and ended up in the NIT Tournament, while also being named to the All-Big 12 First Team.  Unfortunately, he was faced with a freshman-laden team the next season, as there were eight first year players (a school record) on the 2006\u201307 squad.  The next season showed improvement and the Buffs became the first team in Big 12 history to be a 12 seed and upset a number 5 seed (Baylor) in the Big 12 Tournament.  When he finally graduated from CU, he left the school as the all-time leading scorer with 2,001 points\u2014a record that still stands to this day.\nBut it is a record that is shared, because during his senior year, he shared time on the floor with a freshman named Cory Higgins who would one day tie him as the school's all-time leading scorer.  Higgins was more than just a scorer though as during his sophomore year he was one of only 13 players nationally to lead or finish second on his team in five major statistical categories\u2014points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocked shots.  Higgins also found a way to rank nationally in steals, free throw percentage and scoring as well.  For his junior year, Higgins got some more help with the arrival of freshman guard Alec Burks.  Higgins & Burks became the first tandem to net over 500 points in the same season since the 1990\u201391 campaign and were rewarded as Higgins was named to the All-Big 12 Third Team and Burks was named All-Big 12 Freshman of the Year.\n\nThe Tad Boyle era\nTad Boyle was named the 18th coach in University of Colorado men's basketball history on April 19, 2010. In his first season in Boulder, Boyle led the Buffs to a school-record 18 home wins and their highest Big 12 finish (t-5th) since 2005\u201306. CU ranked first in the Big 12 and fifth nationally in free throw percentage (77.8) for the 2010\u201311 season. Boyle's efficient attack also ranked 12th nationally in scoring (79.6 ppg) and 19th nationally in field goal percentage (47.3).\nBoyle earned National Coach of the Week honors (Hoops Report, Jan. 10\u201316) after leading the Buffs to a 3\u20130 conference start, including wins over No. 9/8 Missouri and No. 21/20 Kansas State. The win over the Wildcats gave CU its first road win over a nationally ranked opponent since defeating No. 20 Texas Tech in January 1997. For the season, CU defeated four ranked teams, including a comeback of 22 points down (ranking second all-time in school history) to upset No. 5/5 Texas, 91\u201389. Despite having a very solid season and getting to the semi-finals of the conference tournament, Boyle and the Buffs were snubbed of a bid in the NCAA tournament. CU ended up making it all the way to the NIT semi-finals but lost to Alabama.\nIn his second season at the helm Tad faced an uphill battle, losing 4 starters, 78% of the scoring and most notably Alec Burks to the NBA (#12 overall pick to the Utah Jazz). He was able turn all of this into his second 24 win season in a row, a Pac-12 tournament championship and a trip to the NCAA Tournament as a #11 seed where CU advanced to the round of 32 for the first time in 15 years after beating #6 seed UNLV 68\u201364 in Albuquerque. CU's magical run was ended by Baylor in the round of 32, but in just two seasons, Boyle became the most successful post-season coach in the history of Colorado Basketball.\n\nThe AllBuffs.com All-Time Men's Basketball Team\nThe users on AllBuffs.com had a vote in the summer of 2012 to decide who they considered to be the members of the \"All-Time Men's Basketball Team\" at the University of Colorado.

Their best performance came in the 1990 season when they became the first #8 seed to make the conference championship game before falling to Oklahoma in the championship match.  For their effort, Shaun Vandiver was named Tournament MVP despite being on the losing team.\n\nBig 12 Conference tournament\nIn their fifteen seasons in the Big 12, the Buffs managed to go 9\u201315 in Conference tournament play.  Despite not winning a conference championship, they do have two successful claims to fame during their time.  The first one was in 2008 when the Buffs became the first #12 seed to upset a #5 seed as they beat Baylor in the opening round.  The other one was during their last year in the conference when they beat Iowa State in the opening round and followed that up with their third win of the season over Kansas State before falling just short to Kansas in the semifinals.\n\nPac-12 Conference tournament\n2012 Pac-12 Tournament champions\nThe Buffs won their first conference tournament championship in 2012, their first year in the Pac-12 conference.  Led by tournament MVP Carlon Brown, the 6th\u2013seeded Buffs won four games in four days to bring the championship back to Boulder and earn an invitation to the 2012 NCAA tournament where they would go on to beat UNLV in the second round before losing to Baylor in the third round.\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Buffaloes have appeared in the NCAA Tournament 16 times, with a combined record of 12\u201317.\n\nNIT\nThe Buffaloes have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 14\u201312. They were NIT Champions in 1940.\n\nCBI\nThe Buffaloes have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time. Their record is 1\u20131.\n\nCBC results\nColorado has appeared in the College Basketball Crown once.  Their overall record is 0\u20131.\n\nRecord vs. Big 12 opponents\nThe Colorado Buffaloes have the following all-time series records against Big 12 opponents.\n\nNote all-time series includes non-conference matchups.\n\nFacilities and fans\nCU Events Center\nThe CU Events Center is an 11,064-seat multi-purpose arena on the Boulder main campus of the University of Colorado. The arena opened in 1979, and is home to the Colorado Buffaloes men's and women's basketball teams and the CU volleyball team.  The CEC opened in 1979 and the first game played there was the CU Men's Basketball team hosting the USSR basketball team.  The largest crowd ever to witness a game was on December 5, 2012, when 11,708 people watched CU play CSU (CU won the game 70\u201361).   The facility has also hosted its fair share of concerts as Bob Dylan, U2 and Stevie Wonder are some of the artists to have performed there.\nThe facility was originally named the CU Events/Conference Center and cost $7.7 million to build.  In September 1990, it was renamed the Coors Event Center to honor a $5 million gift from the Adolph Coors Foundation. In 2018, the name was changed to the CU Events Center.\n\nPractice facility\nIn the fall of 2011, the school opened the doors on a brand new practice facility that is located right next to the CU Event Center.  This provides locker rooms and practice courts for the men's & women's basketball teams as well as the women's volleyball team.  The facility is 43,000 square feet and cost $10.8 million, all from private funds.  Each of the two practice courts are 11,000 square feet and are exact replicas of the CU Event Center\u2014down to the lines and logos.  The school also took extra care to make sure that the facility matches the other 200-plus buildings on campus by using sandstone and red-tiled roofs.\nThe facility is also one of two athletic facilities to be given LEED Platinum Certification, which is the highest possible by the internationally recognized system developed by the US Green Building Council.  The facility is estimated to be 40% more energy efficient and 30% more water efficient than similar buildings to it.\n\nC-Unit\nThe student section for CU Basketball is referred to as the C-Unit.  A grassroots organization that was started by a few students in 2004, the C-Unit has gone on to receive tons of praise for their ability to cheer the Buffs on. They started getting attention nationally when the school sent 50 members to Los Angeles for the 2012 Pac-12 Tournament, and then upon getting a bid to the NCAA Tournament, the school sent 100 of them to The Pit in Albuquerque to cheer the team on in their victory over UNLV in the second round of the tournament. The C-Unit, combined with the large number of CU fans who followed the team down for the weekend, turned The Pit into \"Coors Event Center South\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

  "Creighton Bluejays": {
    "biography": "The Creighton Bluejays men's basketball team represents Creighton University of the NCAA Division I  college basketball. It competes in the Big East Conference, which it joined following the Big East conference realignment in 2013. The Bluejays play their home games at CHI Health Center Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska. Creighton finished sixth nationally in home attendance, averaging 17,048 fans per home game in 2014\u201315.\nBefore joining the Big East, Creighton was a member of the Missouri Valley Conference from 1976 through 2013. The Jays were also members of the MVC from 1928 to 1948 and participated as an independent from 1948 to 1977 before rejoining the MVC. The Bluejays have won a record 15 MVC regular season conference titles and a record 12 MVC tournament titles.\nThe team has 23 appearances in the NCAA tournament. The Jays last played in the NCAA Tournament in 2024, and have won at least one NCAA tournament game each of the last four seasons.\nCreighton reached the second weekend of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for the first time in 2021, before losing to eventual runner-up Gonzaga in the Sweet Sixteen. In 2023, they reached their second Elite Eight Regional Final in program history before losing to eventual runner-up San Diego State.\n\nHistory\nArthur Schabinger era (1923\u20131935)\nArthur Schabinger took over the program after Kearney's graduation. He guided the team into its first conference, the North Central Conference, in 1923. His teams would win 4 titles in the league. In 1928, Shabinger would again guide Creighton to another conference, the Missouri Valley Conference. Creighton's winningest men's basketball coach for 75 years, Arthur A. Schabinger helped build the Creighton basketball program. Schabinger posted a 165\u201366 record as coach of the Bluejays from 1922 to 1935. Eleven of his 13 teams finished first or second in the league, including eight teams that won or tied for the title.\n\nEddie Hickey era (1936\u20131947)\nEddie Hickey took over the program for the 1935\u201336 season. Hickey was reared in small-town Nebraska and graduated from Creighton University School of Law in 1926. Sawed-off at 5'5\", Edward 'The Little Giant' Hickey was a dynamic chunky man who had quarterbacked Creighton university football in the Roaring 20's.  He was enamored more by the game he could teach if not, obviously lacking size, play well.  He was the head coach of both the football and basketball teams at Creighton Prep for eight years before moving to Creighton University.\nHickey was a master of the fast break and winning.  He immediately led the Bluejays to the Missouri Valley title in his first season. Their fast break \u2013 'controlled fast break' Eddie would emphasize sarcastically \u2013 featured an explosive movement that required the ball not to hit the floor. 'The Little Giant' would take Creighton to new heights by the early 1940s, with 1943 Consensus First Team All American Ed Beisser in the middle and his high powered offense. Hickey would lead the Jays to their first NCAA tournament and two National Invitation Tournaments, including a Final Four (Third-place game winner) in 1942, (when the NIT was bigger than the NCAA tournament). With his flair for 'run-sheep-run' basketball, Hickey and his teams were a good show in the Big Apple.\nWorld War II would briefly suspend Creighton's basketball program and Hickey would return to coach for one year after the war before moving on to St. Louis.  His 126\u201371 record and four conference titles in nine seasons at Creighton was followed by success in St. Louis and later Marquette. Edgar Hickey would go down as a hall of fame coach with a 36-year college career of 570\u2013268.\n\nPost-war era (1948\u20131959)\nThe post-war era was full of change and mediocrity for the Jays. Future athletic director Julius 'Duce' Belford coached the Jays immediately after the war. Creighton would leave the Missouri Valley Conference and switch from Division I to Division III during this era. The Jays would not find success at this new level. Belford finished with a 56\u201383 record over six seasons. His successors would not fare better.  Sebastian 'Subby' Salerno took the reins in 1952 and left three years later. Salerno finished with a 30\u201345 record.  Theron Thomsen replaced Salerno and found some success. After eight losing seasons, Thomsen's 1956\u201357 Bluejays would post a 15\u20136 mark. However, the Jays would slide back toward mediocrity finishing 10\u201312 and 13\u20139 in the following two seasons. In 1959, Athletic Director Duce Belford made it a priority to bring back the once proud Creighton basketball program.\n\nJohn 'Red' McManus era (1960\u20131969)\nJohn J. 'Red' McManus came to Creighton after a successful career of eight seasons at St. Ambrose Academy and a year as head freshman and assistant varsity coach at Iowa. The 1959\u201360 Bluejays were a far cry from the previous year's team. Whereas the team had previously utilized a slow methodical type of basketball, McManus brought a fast break offense and a box zone defense. Utilizing sharp recruiting and tough coaching, Red quickly had the Bluejays back on the road to becoming a national power.  The 1961\u201362 Creighton Bluejays men's basketball team finished 21\u20135 and reached the Sweet Sixteen of the 1962 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, going on to win the third spot in the NCAA Regional. Paul Silas was the nation's top rebounder.\nThe 1963\u201364 Bluejays finished with a 22\u20137 record, a record for most wins in a season. All-American and team captain Paul Silas rounded his collegiate basketball career by leading the team back to the Sweet Sixteen in the 1964 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Silas, who guided the Bluejays to two NCAA tournament berths in his three-year career, led the nation in rebounding his sophomore and junior years.\nMcManus would continue to coach at Creighton until 1969.  He would go down as the third-winningest coach in school history, leaving with a 138\u2013118 mark. Red McManus was a colorful character, with a mean streak who was always a respected gentleman off the court. He rebuilt the Jays' schedules into coast-to-coast clashes with the nation's top basketball powers. His teams got NCAA post-season tourney bids in 1962 and 1964, and his players included professionals Paul Silas, Neil Johnson, Elton McGriff, Bob Portman and Wally Anderzunas.  McManus resigned after building a schedule of national prominence-the job he was hired to do.\n\nEddie Sutton era (1970\u20131974)\nOne of college basketball's legendary coaches, Eddie Sutton got his first Division I head coaching job at Creighton. Sutton left College of Southern Idaho in 1969 to coach at Creighton. It was with the Bluejays that he made his first coaching appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1974. With a patient passing offense, he led the Bluejays to an 82\u201350 mark between 1969 and 1974.\nSutton's career coincided with the apex of the Travelin\u2019 Jays Era.  Red McManus coined the phrase \"border to border and coast to coast\" in 1959 when he began the Travelin\u2019 Jays era, but it was under Eddie Sutton that the philosophy really bore fruit and gained the Jays national recognition.  During his last three years at Creighton, the Bluejays played in 36 cities and 20 states, logged more than 65,000 miles in the air, made a South American jaunt (entertaining the Chile national team at home in exchange), and visited Hawaii.  Sutton was a Tulsa native, and in 1974 a bidding war commenced between Oral Roberts, Duke, and Arkansas for Sutton's services. Arkansas won the battle, announcing Sutton as their new head coach on March 27, 1974.\nOver an illustrious 37 year coaching career, Sutton compiled an 804\u2013328 record, putting him eighth on the all-time Division I wins list. He became the first coach to lead four schools to the NCAA Tournament, taking Creighton, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Oklahoma State.\n\nTom Apke era (1975\u20131981)\nAssistant coach Tom Apke took over for the departing Sutton. Apke planned to run the same defensive schemes Sutton had: namely, a fierce man-to-man base defense, with a 2\u20133 zone as a change-up. The offense was where major changes were made. Apke looked to run a fast break at every opportunity, taking advantage of every shot opportunity. The news media was pessimistic as Apke entered his first season.  Prognostications grew even worse after Mike Heck, Creighton's first 7 footer and a rising star, suddenly died because of an enlarged heart after the first game of the season. The 1974\u201375 Creighton Bluejays rallied after Heck's death and ended up reaching the 1975 NCAA tournament finishing with a 20\u20137 record.\nApke led Creighton back to the Missouri Valley Conference in 1977 after 29 years of independence. He found instant success winning the 1978 conference regular and conference tournament titles and advancing to the 1978 NCAA tournament. The Bluejays would continue winning at a high level again returning to postseason play in the 1981 NCAA tournament.\nAfter the 1980\u201381 season, Apke accepted the head coaching position at Colorado.  Apke spent 17 years in all at Creighton \u2013 four as a player, six as an assistant coach and seven as head coach. He is the only coach in school history to have led Creighton to the NCAA Tournament in his first season with the team (1974\u201375). A team captain on Creighton's 1964\u201365 team, Apke went on to coach the Jays to a 130\u201364 record from 1974\u201381. Three of his teams went to NCAA tournaments and another to the National Invitation Tournament.\n\nWillis Reed era (1982\u20131985)\nSutton and Apke's departures upset Creighton officials who yearned to make the program 'big time'. Officials hinted that the new head coach would be a 'big name' hire. Former New York Knicks great Willis Reed fit the bill.  After being fired in 1978 after a season and a fraction as the Knicks' coach, Reed was determined to prove himself as a coach. Reed accepted the position at Creighton, generating controversy in the Bluejay community.\nLongtime assistant coach Tom Broshnihan, who had been around since Sutton, was seen as the rightful heir to the Creighton head coaching job. A sizable segment of the fan-base criticized Reed as lacking experience in college coaching and recruiting.  High school basketball in Nebraska produced a record number of prospects prior to Willis Reed's first season. Reed was unable to sign any of the blue-chips, including Ron Kellogg and Dave Hoppen. It did not help that Reed was breaking the color barrier, becoming the first black head basketball coach at Creighton.\nComing off Tom Apke's impressive 21\u20139 season featuring an NCAA appearance, Reed's inaugural 7\u201320 mark added fuel to the fire. Reed proved himself as a recruiter that off-season. Considered by many scouts to be the top prospect in the country, Benoit Benjamin was sought by 350 colleges. Benjamin came from a single-mother home and looked for a father figure, preferably a college coach who had played center. Fortunately for Creighton, coach Willis Reed was a former seven-time NBA All-Star center with the Knicks and a member of the Hall of Fame.\nBenjamin's signing gave Reed instant credibility as a recruiter. Despite the landmark signing, the Jays would again struggle in 1982\u201383 finishing with an 8\u201319 record. Coach Reed worked with Benjamin over the off-season.  Benoit came back as a sophomore in 1983\u201384 and dominated college basketball. The Bluejays would reach the NIT that year finishing 17\u201314. The 1984\u201385 season team would win 20 games. As a junior during the 1984\u201385 season, Benoit Benjamin led all of NCAA Division I in blocked shots and was the nation's second-leading rebounder. Benoit Benjamin would leave for the NBA following the season. A two-time AP All-America center for the Bluejays, Benoit Benjamin would begin a 15-year NBA career in 1985 as the third overall draft pick in the first round by the Los Angeles Clippers. He would go down as the all-time leader for blocked shots in Missouri Valley Conference history with 411 rejections. Coach Reed had proven himself as a coach, recruiting a top prospect and developing him into one of the nation's best.\nWillis Reed resigned as coach of the Creighton University basketball team after the 1984\u201385 season. He compiled a 52\u201365 record at Creighton. His 1984\u201385 Bluejays were 20\u201312 but lost their last six games. Reed felt that he would be unable to maintain a high level of success without violating NCAA rules.\n\nTony Barone era (1985\u20131991)\nInheriting Reed's team was fiery Tony Barone.  His 1985\u201386 team posted a 12\u201316 record, finishing tied for fifth in the Valley. Coach Barone's second team would fare even worse finishing 9\u201319.  During the off-season, Creighton would bring in a talented class of freshman including Bob Harstad and Chad Gallagher. The pair would go down in Creighton lore as the Dynamic Duo. The 1987\u201388 squad would exhibit markedly improved play, finishing 16\u201316 after playing a schedule featuring some of the top teams in the country.\nThe 1988\u201389 team would be Tony Barone's breakthrough team.  Creighton surprised everyone outside Omaha and claimed its first regular season MVC championship in 11 years.  The Bluejays would cap the season by winning the MVC conference tournament in epic fashion.  The conference championship saw Harstad lead the Jays over Southern Illinois 79-77.  The game was punctuated by a James Farr game winner with 2 seconds remaining.  Creighton clinched an automatic berth to the 1989 NCAA tournament with the win.\nCreighton followed up their NCAA Tournament berth in 1988\u201389 by winning more games overall than the year before, going 21\u201312 in 1989\u201390. The consensus favorite to repeat as MVC champions, they got off to a good start, as they scored wins over Iowa State and Notre Dame before going on the road and taking #5 Missouri to the wire. They would finish tied for second in the conference and bow out of the conference tournament semifinals. Juniors Bob Harstad and Chad Gallagher would have break out seasons. Harstad would win the 1990 Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year Award. Gallagher would finish as runner-up.\nExpectation were high entering the Dynamic Duo's senior season. The 1990\u201391 Creighton Bluejays finished as one of the school's all-time best, finishing 24\u20138. The Jays claimed both the regular season and conference tournament crowns before advancing to the second round of the 1991 NCAA tournament. Chad Gallagher was named the 1991 Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year. Gallagher and Harstad both rank in the top five all-time in both scoring and rebounding for Creighton. Together they won two MVC regular season and conference tournament titles as well as two NCAA and one NIT appearances. Following the 1990\u201391 season, coach Tony Barone accepted the head coaching job at Texas A&M.\n\nRick Johnson era (1991\u20131994)\nAssistant coach Rick Johnson was promoted to head coach following Tony Barone's departure. Johnson's tenure at Creighton was a struggle. His teams finished with progressively worse records.  He left after the 1993\u201394 season in which the team posted a 7\u201322 mark. Johnson finished with a 24\u201359 record over three seasons at Creighton.\n\nDana Altman era (1995\u20132010)\nRodney Buford era\nDana Altman, a Wilber, Nebraska native, left his position as head coach at Kansas State for Creighton in 1994.  Altman immediately went to work rejuvenating the program. He struggled at first posting a 7\u201319 record in his first year. That off-season, Altman signed Rodney Buford. Altman's Jays improved to 14\u201315 and 15\u201315 the following two seasons.  After the 1996\u201397 season, coach Altman brought in talented prospects Ryan Sears and Ben Walker. The two, along with Buford, would help rebuild Creighton into a college basketball power.  The 1997\u201398 team finished 18\u201310 and reached the NIT.  The 1998\u201399 team would finish second in the Valley and reach the 1999 NCAA tournament after claiming the MVC conference tournament title.  The Jays reached the second round following a 62\u201358 first-round victory over Louisville. Rodney Buford would finish as the all-time leading scorer for the Jays, with 2,116 points.\n\nRyan Sears & Ben Walker era\nThe 1999\u20132000 would repeat as MVC conference tournament champions, earning a berth in the 2000 NCAA tournament. Led by Juniors Ryan Sears and Ben Walker and MVC Newcomer of the Year Kyle Korver, the Jays would finish with a 23\u201310 record. The 2000\u201301 team improved to 24\u20138 and won the first Missouri Valley Conference regular season title in 9 seasons. Senior guards Ryan Sears and Ben Walker finished their careers with another trip to the NCAA tournament.  Creighton's field marshal, Sears started every game of his 4-year career and finished each of his four seasons with more steals than turnovers. Walker, Creighton's go-to player during late-game situations, finished with 1,238 points and 677 rebounds.\n\nKyle Korver era\nThe 2001\u201302 team was replacing both Ben Walker and Ryan Sears and defending a regular season MVC crown, yet behind Kyle Korver's brilliance, they shared the league title and won the MVC Tournament while having a nearly identical record as the year before at 23\u20139.  Korver's deadly 3-point shooting forced many teams to employ a box and one defense against the Creighton star. Despite the added attention, Korver scored 20 or more points 10 times. The Creighton-Southern Illinois Rivalry reached its peak during the early 2000s.  Korver scored a combined 49 points in two regular season losses before leading the Jays to victory over the Salukis 84\u201376 in the conference championship game.  Kyle Korver was named the 2002 MVC Player of the Year.  In the 2002 NCAA Tournament, the Jays vanquished Florida in the first round.  Korver fouled out late in the second overtime and saved the late game heroics for Terrell Taylor, who drained a buzzer-beating three-pointer.\nThe Bluejay bandwagon was growing and the Jays consistently sold out the 9,377 capacity Civic. Expectations were at a record high entering the 2002\u201303 season.  Creighton would live up to most of them, setting a school record for wins. The team went 29\u20135 and was ranked in the top 25 most of the season. Kyle Korver would be chosen by ESPN's Dick Vitale as the 2002\u201303 Midseason National Player of the Year. Korver would set a school record with nine three-pointers against Evansville and repeat as MVC conference Player of the Year. The Jays would finish second in the Valley behind rivals Southern Illinois, but once again knock off the Salukis in the conference championship game throttling them 80\u201356. The Jays would finish ranked 15th following the 2003 NCAA tournament.\nTwo-time league Player of the Year Kyle Korver ranks as one of the top players in Creighton and Missouri Valley Conference history. Korver finished his career tied for sixth in NCAA history with 371 three-pointers while placing 14th in accuracy at 45.3 percent from long-range. Korver helped lead Creighton's return to the top-25 and garnered unprecedented attention for his all-around play. He had a successful NBA career and last played for the Milwaukee Bucks in September 2020. As of April 2022, he is a free agent.\n\nNate Funk era\nCreighton's basketball program had grown too big for the Civic Auditorium and the Jays moved into the 17,975 seat Qwest Center, now known as CHI Health Center, prior to the 2003\u201304 season.  The Jays would fill up the arena on a consistent basis and become one of the nation's perennial leaders in attendance.\nThe sharpshooter torch was passed from Kyle Korver to sophomore guard Nate Funk for the 2003\u201304 season.  He responded by leading the team in both scoring and assists.  The 2003\u201304 Jays would finish 20\u20139 and reach the NIT.  Funk took a massive leap forward his junior year, going from the best player on his own team to arguably the best player in the league.  The 2004\u201305 team finished 23\u201311 and won the MVC conference crown.  Nate Funk was runner-up for the conference player of the year and the Bluejays earned a berth in the 2005 NCAA tournament.\nThe 2005\u201306 Creighton men's basketball team entered the season with high hopes that were cut short when star guard Nate Funk went down with injury in a game at DePaul.  Funk would try to make a comeback but wasn't the player he had been.  He would request and receive a medical redshirt.  Without Funk, the Bluejays still managed a 20\u201310 record reaching the second round of the 2006 NIT.\nNate Funk returned for his fifth season and center Anthony Tolliver emerged as one of the best players in the conference.  Although the team 2006\u201307 team struggled early, the team found its groove down the stretch as Funk scored 20 or more points in 11 games and Tolliver dominated the post.  The 2006\u201307 team finished 22\u201311 and won the MVC conference tournament over rival Southern Illinois 67\u201361 to earn a berth in the 2007 NCAA tournament.  For his career, Nate Funk had 1,754 points, which ranks sixth all-time in Creighton history.\n\nArkansas fiasco\nOn April 2, 2007, Altman announced that he would become the head coach for the Arkansas Razorbacks, in a deal that was rumored to be a five year, $1.5 million per year contract. Only one day later he had a change of heart and returned to Omaha and his team at Creighton, citing family reasons. Altman never again reached the NCAA Tournament at Creighton even though his teams would continue to post 20 win seasons.\nThe 2007\u201308 team finished the season 22\u201311, but would lose in the quarterfinals of the MVC tournament. The Bluejays received an invitation to the NIT where they defeated Rhode Island before losing to Florida. The 2009 Bluejays shared the MVC regular season title and was led by Booker Woodfox. Despite the Bluejays gaudy 26\u20137 record, a loss to Illinois State in the semifinals of the MVC Tournament led to another trip to the NIT where they would lose in the second round to Kentucky. The 2009\u201310 team would be Altman's last, finishing 18\u201316. Dana Altman accepted the head coaching position at Oregon shortly after the season ended.\nCreighton's second winningest coach with 327 wins, Dana Altman was the only coach in MVC history to lead his school to seven straight years of improved records. Altman won three MVC regular-season titles, six MVC Tournament crowns, and led his troops to 13 consecutive postseason bids.\n\nGreg McDermott years (2010\u2013present)\nFormer Northern Iowa coach Greg McDermott resigned from Iowa State and accepted the head coaching job at Creighton following Altman's departure. The 2010\u201311 Jays finished 23\u201316 and reached the finals of the College Basketball Invitational to face their former head coach's new team, Oregon. The Ducks would win the best-of-three series two games to one. The following year, the Jays featured senior point guard Antoine Young and Rutgers transfer Gregory Echenique in the post. Coach McDermott's son, Doug McDermott, emerged as a star player, being named a consensus first-team All-American and MVC Player of the Year in both 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Creighton finished second in the Valley during the regular season and won the MVC Conference tournament. Finishing the season 29\u20136, they advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament by beating Alabama before falling to North Carolina. In 2013, Creighton won both the MVC regular-season and Tournament titles, ending the season 28\u20137. They defeated Cincinnati in the first round before losing to No. 2-seeded Duke in the second round.\nShortly after the end of the 2013 season, Creighton was one of three schools invited to join the Big East Conference by the \"Catholic 7\", the group of schools that split from the original Big East to form a non-football version of the league.\nIn their first season in the Big East, Creighton finished as runner-up in both the regular season (to Villanova) and Tournament (to Providence). Doug McDermott was named Big East Player of the Year, was again named a consensus first-team All-American, and was the consensus national player of the year. Also, McDermott became only the eighth player in Division I men's basketball history to score 3,000 career points, finishing fifth on the all-time scoring list. The Jays received a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament, their highest seeding ever. They beat Louisiana-Lafayette in the second round, but lost to No. 6-seeded Baylor in the Third Round.\nWith the departure of Doug McDermott to the NBA, the 2015 Bluejays struggled to a 14\u201319 record, their worst finish since 1995. In 2016, the Bluejays improved to 20\u201315, finishing in sixth place in the Big East and receiving an invite to the NIT. They advanced to the NIT quarterfinals before losing to BYU.\nThe 2017 Bluejays returned to a conference power, beginning the season 13\u20130. Led by senior point guard Maurice Watson Jr, the Bluejays moved to 18\u20131 (their only loss to No. 1 Villanova) before Watson tore his ACL and was lost for the remainder of the season. Shortly after he was injured, Watson was arrested for sexual assault and was suspended from the team. With the loss of Watson, the Bluejays lost seven of their remaining 12 games to finish the regular season at 23\u20138 and in a tie for third place in the Big East. They were able to rebound in the Big East tournament, advancing to the championship game before losing to Villanova. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 6 seed and lost to Rhode Island in the first round.\nIn June 2017, Coach McDermott received interest from the Ohio State University to fill its head coaching vacancy. However, he turned down the offer choosing to remain at Creighton.\nOn March 22, 2022, McDermott received a \"multi-year\" contract extension. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The Bluejays finished the 2022\u201323 season with a 24\u201312 record. They advanced to the Elite Eight for the second time in school history, and first time since 1941.\nOn March 8, 2024, McDermott received another contract extension to keep him at Creighton through the 2027-2028 season; his previous contract was due to expire after the end of the 2025-2026 season. The new contract also makes McDermott one of the highest-paid coaches in the Big East. On November 13, 2024, McDermott became Creighton's all-time winningest coach.\n\nFacilities\nVinardi Center\nThe Bluejays went 336\u201392 (.785) in 42 seasons in the 3,000-seat Vinardi Center (then known as University Gym) from the time Creighton began sponsoring men's basketball in 1916 through the 1959\u201360 season.  Creighton split its home games between University Gym and the Omaha Civic Auditorium from 1955\u201360 before moving into the Civic full-time for the 1960\u201361 year.\n\nOmaha Civic Auditorium\nHome to Creighton men's basketball from 1955 to 2003, the Omaha Civic Auditorium provided a tremendous home-court advantage for the Jays. Creighton went 434\u2013155 (.737) overall in the facility.  The Civic was home to five regular-season MVC champs and eight MVC Tournament champs before the CU men closed their run at the Civic in 2003 with six straight sellouts. The Jays returned to the Civic for the first time in seven years in 2010, winning two CIT games when CenturyLink Center Omaha was booked.\n\nCHI Health Center Omaha\nHome to Creighton men's basketball since 2003, CHI Health Center Omaha ranks as one of college basketball's best venues. The arena was originally known as Qwest Center Omaha, changing in 2011 to CenturyLink Center Omaha after Qwest was purchased by CenturyLink. When CenturyLink opted out of the naming rights contract after the 2017\u201318 season, a new deal was reached with locally based healthcare provider CHI Health, and the arena was accordingly renamed in September 2018. Creighton finished sixth nationally in home attendance, averaging 17,048 fans per home game in 2014\u201315. It's the ninth straight season that Creighton has been among the nation's top-25 in average home attendance. During their time in the Missouri Valley, they set multiple average home attendance records.\n\nDancing Grandma\nMary Ann Filippi, known as 'Dancing Grandma', was a fixture at Creighton basketball home games and a local celebrity. She had been attending Creighton men's basketball games since the Red McManus Era, rarely missing home games. Filippi quickly became a video-board favorite after the move to Qwest Center. Whenever the camera would show her cheering for her beloved Bluejays, the arena would erupt in cheers. She often hyped up the crowd with her signature 'Raise the Roof' dance and had appeared in several Athletic Department videos and television broadcasts. She was popular with Creighton students and fans alike, who often posed for pictures with her prior to tip-off. Filippi died on September 28, 2015, at the age of 92.\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Bluejays have appeared in 27 NCAA Tournaments.

The teams met 42 times between 1950 and 1988, but the series was discontinued once Marquette dropped its independent status and joined the Midwestern Collegiate Conference in 1988. The rivalry was renewed when both schools joined the newly reformed Big East conference in 2013. \nSince 1923, Marquette has lead the series 60-40.\n\nTrivia\nCreighton is the only NCAA Division-I men's basketball team with a Bluejay as its mascot.\nFrom 1961\u20132003, the Creighton men's basketball team played their home games at the Omaha Civic Auditorium. The \"Civic\" was the home of the Creighton women's basketball and volleyball teams until 2009, when they moved into the D.J. Sokol Arena at the Ryan Center in 2009. The building is located across Interstate 480 from Morrison Stadium in downtown Omaha.\nBenoit Benjamin and Baylor Scheierman are the only two players in team history to have recorded a triple-double in a single game.  Benjamin recorded three triple-doubles during his college basketball career.\nBaseball Hall of Famer Bob Gibson finished his Creighton basketball career in 1957 as the school's third-best scorer (1,272 points) and second on the CU list for free throws made in a career (418).

When the 2020 seasons was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Flyers did not get to participate in the 2020 NCAA Tournament, despite being projected as a #1 seed by several outlets.\nA 2015 study of college basketball team valuations placed Dayton No. 23 in the nation with 2014 adjusted revenues in excess of $16.6 million (highest for non-football conference programs) and a valuation of nearly $84 million (second highest for non-football conference programs and higher than programs such as Florida, Texas, and Michigan).\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1903\u20131947)\nThe first collegiate basketball team began play at Dayton, then known as St. Mary's Institute, during the 1903\u201304 season. The school's early teams were informally nicknamed \"The Saints\" by local sportswriters and competed against colleges, high schools, and club teams throughout the Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and New York region. Early rivalries with Notre Dame and Miami (Ohio) began in the 1908\u201309 season, and with Ohio State in the 1913\u201314 season,. Fr. William O'Malley is recognized as the first coach of the Saints, but the team had no coach for the first six seasons. Harry Solimano, believed to be a former Saints player, succeeded O'Malley in the 1910 season and coached the team four seasons and again for the 1919\u201320 seasons. In 1920 the school changed its name to the University of Dayton and its sports teams gradually became known as the Flyers. Also in 1920, the school began playing nearby Xavier University, a rivalry that has spawned 156 meetings as of 2014. Games were originally played in an on-campus gymnasium, but later (1969) moved to the nearby University of Dayton Arena. Harry Baujan became both the football and basketball coach in 1923 and later became the school's athletic director. Through the 1920s and 1930s, the basketball program was subordinate to the football program with respect to resources and athletic department focus. In 1939, Baujan hired James Carter as both an assistant football coach and head basketball coach. Carter moved to expand Dayton's national profile by issuing basketball scholarships and scheduling trips to east coast basketball powers such as St John's and St Joseph's,. Carter is also recognized as the first Dayton coach to play an African American student-athlete. World War II brought a two-year hiatus to the basketball program between 1943 and 1945. Most people think \"America's Team\" refers to the Dallas Cowboys. However, it was originally coined in 1945, referring to the Dayton Flyers Men's Basketball team.\n\nTom Blackburn era and national emergence (1947\u20131964)\nIn 1947, Tom Blackburn succeeded Carter as the school's first full-time head basketball coach. Blackburn, noted as a strict disciplinarian, recruited many former military men to his early squads and began to shift Dayton's scheduling focus from strictly local Ohio collegiate teams to a more regional focus, starting series with such programs as Louisville in 1947\u201348 season. Blackburn would recruit future NBA player Don Meineke, along with local standouts Junior Norris & Chuck Grigsby in 1948 to form the nucleus of the school's first nationally recognized teams. The 1950\u201351 Flyers reached #13 in the AP Poll and the finals of the NIT before bowing out to Brigham Young. The following year, the Flyers also reached the NIT Finals, while also participating in the NCAA tournament for the first time, finishing in the regional semi-final. In light of the school's growing national stature and increasing fan base, the university constructed the 5,800 seat on-campus University of Dayton Fieldhouse in 1950. Blackburn established Dayton as a national basketball power, winning the National Invitation Tournament in 1962, reaching the NIT finals six times during the 1950s and early 1960s, and securing a #2 AP ranking for most of the 1955\u20131956 season. The foundation established by Blackburn led to Dayton being the most successful Division I basketball program through the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nDon Donoher era (1964\u20131989)\nTom Blackburn became ill with terminal lung cancer during the 1963\u201364 season. Don Donoher, a former Dayton player and assistant coach took over for the final three games of the 1963\u201364 season. Blackburn died in March, and Dayton formally named Donoher as his successor. Donoher, with Assistant Coach Chuck Grigsby, guided the Flyers to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in his first two years as coach; they then led the Flyers to the 1967 NCAA Championship game by beating Western Kentucky, #8 ranked Tennessee, Virginia Tech, and #4 ranked North Carolina, before falling to #1 ranked and eventual champion UCLA 79\u201364 in the final. Donoher's 1967\u201368 squad began the season ranked #6 in the country in the AP Poll, but faltered in early competition and finished with a 17\u20139 record, missing the NCAA tournament. Nonetheless, Donoher's Flyers made a successful run through the 1968 NIT field, besting Kansas in the championship to win their second NIT crown. The Flyers would again face UCLA in a pivotal NCAA tournament game in 1974. The 20\u20137 Flyers squared off against the Bruins in the West Regional Sweet Sixteen and took the Bill Walton-led seven consecutive NCAA Champions to three overtimes before eventually falling 111\u2013100. Donoher would again lead the Flyers to NCAA success in 1984 as Roosevelt Chapman led Flyers bested LSU, #7 ranked Oklahoma, and #15 ranked Washington before falling in the Elite Eight to eventual national champion Georgetown. The 24-season Donoher era was arguably Dayton's finest, producing eight NCAA tournament invitations, and eight NIT invitations. Following the success of the 1967 National Runner Up squad, the university began planning for a new 13,500 seat facility to house the nationally prominent Flyers. The UD Arena became the Flyer's home court at the start of the 1969\u201370 season.\nDayton resisted the trend towards league affiliation that began to sweep over college basketball in the 1970s and early 1980s. Instead, Dayton formed an informal home-home scheduling alliance with peer programs such as DePaul, Marquette, and Notre Dame during the early-mid 1980s in an effort to fill their schedules with quality opponents,. Dayton was approached as early as 1978 to join what would eventually become the Horizon League, but avoided league affiliation until the 1987\u201388 season when the school began play in the future Horizon League, then the Midwestern Collegiate Conference,.\n\nJim O'Brien era (1989\u20131994)\nFollowing three successive losing seasons, Donoher retired after the 1988\u201389 season. He was succeeded by Jim O'Brien, former head basketball coach at Wheeling Jesuit University. The Flyers won the MCC conference tournament in 1990, and defeated Illinois in the first round of the NCAA tournament before bowing out to eventual Final Four participant Arkansas in the second round, 86\u201384. The Flyers moved to the Great Midwest Conference in 1993, but produced a dismal 1\u201323 conference record over their two seasons of league play. O'Brien was dismissed following the 1993\u201394 season after successive 4\u201326 and 6\u201321 seasons, their worst in modern school history.\n\nOliver Purnell era (1994\u20132003)\nDayton turned to Old Dominion head basketball coach Oliver Purnell to resurrect their moribund basketball program. The dissolution of the Great Midwest Conference in 1995 and subsequent snub by former conference mates in joining the new Conference USA further complicated Purnell's rebuilding task. In 1995 the Flyers accepted an invitation to join the A10, where they remain today. Purnell guided the Flyers to the 1998 NIT, the school's first post-season appearance in eight seasons. Purnell would lead the Flyers back to the NCAA tournament in 2000 following the Co-SIDA Classic Championship, an 11\u20135 conference record and non-conference victories over #12 ranked Kentucky, New Mexico, and rival Marquette. Purnell's 2000\u201301 team earned the program's first national ranking for the school since 1974 following victories over #12 UConn and #6 Maryland in the 2000 Maui Invitational Tournament. Dayton would go on to reach the quarterfinals of the 2001 NIT. Dayton would again make the NIT field in 2002. The 2002\u201303 season would mark the completion of Purnell's rebuilding project as the Flyers compiled a 24\u20136 record and reached as high as #16 in the AP Poll following victories over #21 Cincinnati, #13 Marquette, and two wins over #25 St Joseph's en route to their first Atlantic 10 championship. The Flyers earned a #4 seed in the 2003 NCAA tournament, but fell to Tulsa in the first round. Following the season, Purnell accepted an offer to become the Clemson head basketball coach.\n\nBrian Gregory era (2003\u20132011)\nOn April 9, 2003, the University of Dayton announced that Michigan State assistant Brian Gregory would become the 18th head basketball coach for the Flyers. Gregory enjoyed immediate success with his new team, guiding the senior-laden Flyers to a 24\u20139 record, the 2003 Maui Invitational Tournament Championship and a berth in the NCAA tournament in his inaugural season. The 2006\u201307 team finished the season 19\u201312 with wins over NCAA tournament bound Louisville, Creighton, Holy Cross, Miami, and George Washington.\nThe Flyers opened the 2007\u201308 campaign with a 14\u20131 record and wins over 12th-ranked Louisville, sixth-ranked Pitt, and 22nd-ranked Rhode Island. On December 31, 2008, the team was voted into both Top 25 polls for the first time since 2003. The team reached as high as 14th in the AP Poll and 18th in the Coaches Poll. However injuries to Chris Wright and Charles Little derailed Dayton's season. The Flyers finished 9\u201310 in conference play, but 23\u201311 overall and were able to reach the quarterfinals of the NIT, losing at Ohio State.\nThe Flyers built upon the progress of the 2007\u201308 season by compiling a 27\u20138 overall record (11\u20135 Atlantic-10) and defeating No. 15 Marquette and No. 17 Xavier en route to an NCAA tournament berth. The Flyers stunned higher seeded West Virginia before bowing out to Kansas in the Second Round. The 2009\u201310 Flyers began the season with high expectations, but faltered in league play to miss the NCAA tournament. However, the Flyers regrouped to storm through the NIT bracket, defeating Cincinnati and Illinois on their home floors and besting Ole Miss and North Carolina in New York to win the 2010 NIT Championship, the school's third NIT title. Gregory compiled a 172\u201394 record with the Flyers through eight seasons, leading them to two NCAAs and three NITs. Gregory also recruited future NBA players Brian Roberts, Chris Wright, and Chris Johnson, Dayton's first NBA players since Negele Knight in 1990. Gregory accepted the head coaching position at Georgia Tech following the 2010\u201311 season.\n\nArchie Miller era (2011\u20132017)\nThe Dayton Flyers turned to Arizona assistant Archie Miller in 2011 to lead the program. Miller's first team won the 2011 Old Spice Classic, shocked No. 16-ranked Alabama and reached the 2012 NIT as a No. 2 seed, but would lose in the first round.\nThe 2013\u201314 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team placed third in the 2013 Maui Invitational, beating No. 11-ranked Gonzaga and California. The 2013\u201314 team experienced a mid-season swoon due to injuries, but entered A-10 tournament play on a 9\u20131 run with victories over league rivals No. 17 Saint Louis, UMass and George Washington.\nDayton received a No. 11 seed as an at-large team to the 2014 NCAA tournament South Region. The Flyers faced in-state foe Ohio State in the second round, winning a thrilling 60\u201359 decision. The Flyers next faced Syracuse in the third round and again upset the heavily favored higher seed 55\u201353 to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in three decades. The Flyers advanced to the Elite Eight with an 82\u201372 victory over Stanford in the Sweet Sixteen, but fell to Florida in the South Regional Championship, 62\u201352.\nThe 2014\u201315 team began the season with high expectations as the Flyers returned a solid nucleus of experienced players. The Flyers placed third in the 2014 Puerto Rico Tip-Off, besting Texas A&M and Boston College. However, the Flyers suffered a seemingly debilitating setback when two front court players were dismissed from the team in mid-December. Coupled with season-ending injuries to other players and the loss of a freshman to NCAA partial qualifier status, the Flyers were left with only six scholarship players, none of whom were taller than 6'6\". The Flyers regrouped and finished the non-conference part of their season with wins over Georgia Tech and Ole Miss. The Flyers carried this momentum into league play and finished second in the Atlantic 10 regular season with a 13\u20135 mark. The Flyers squared off against VCU in the Atlantic 10 Tournament Championship game, but fell 71\u201365.\nDespite an RPI ranking of 32, the Flyers were placed in the First Four of the 2015 NCAA tournament against Boise State in the East Region. In their First Four play-in game, Dayton beat Boise State, advancing to the Round of 64. The Flyers pulled off another upset of a No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament, beating the Providence by double digits, 66\u201353, thus advancing to the Round of 32. However, they fell to No. 13 Oklahoma in the third round.\nThe 2015\u201316 team was predicted to win the A-10. They started the season well beating No. 21 Vanderbilt and finishing the non-conference schedule at 10\u20132. They finished in a first place tie in the A-10 season and earned their third consecutive trip to the NCAA tournament. However, they could not repeat past success as they were upset by eventual Final Four participant Syracuse in the First Round.\nIn 2017, the Flyers won the regular season championship of the A-10 by one game over VCU. However, they were upset in the quarterfinals of the A-10 tournament. The Flyers did receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 7 seed. In the First Round, they faced Wichita State who many argued was underrated as a No. 10 seed. The Flyers would lose to Wichita State 64\u201358. On March 25, 2017, Archie Miller left the school to accept the head coaching position at Indiana. He finished with a six-year record of 139\u201363 at Dayton.\n\nAnthony Grant era (2017\u2013present)\nShortly after Miller's departure for Indiana, the school hired Oklahoma City Thunder assistant coach and Dayton alum Anthony Grant as head coach on March 30, 2017. Grant previously served as head coach at VCU and Alabama. Grant began laying the groundwork for the future with his first recruiting class that included future stars Obi Toppin and Jalen Crutcher.  His first season at Dayton saw the Flyers finish 14\u201317 overall, the first time since the 2005\u201306 season that the team finished with a losing record.  His second season featured breakout red-shirt freshman Toppin, who led the team to a third-place finish in the A-10. They lost their first game of the conference tournament, and missed the NCAA tournament for the second straight season. They earned a five seed in the NIT, but lost in the first round at Colorado.\nGrant's third season proved to be one of the best in Dayton basketball history. The 2019\u201320 team began by routing Georgia and Virginia Tech en route to the finals of the 2019 Maui Invitational Tournament where they lost in overtime to Kansas. The Flyers steadily climbed the 2019\u20132020 AP Poll, finishing the season 29\u20132, 18\u20130 in Atlantic 10 Conference play and ranked number three in the nation. Dayton was the only team in the nation not to have lost in regulation during the 2019\u201320 season and was a projected #1 seed in the East Region in several NCAA tournament bracket projections. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA tournament on March 12, 2020, prior to completion of the Atlantic 10 tournament and the NCAA opted not to release the Men's and Women's Championship brackets. A post cancellation computer simulation of Jerry Palm's projected field resulted in Dayton winning the championship.  Despite the abrupt end, the season yielded numerous highlights for the team and program. Toppin & Crutcher were both named to the Atlantic 10 Conference First Team, while teammates Trey Landers and Ryan Mikesell were named to the Third Team and All-Academic Teams respectively. Toppin was named the Atlantic 10 Player of the Year and Grant was named A-10 Coach of the Year. Toppin was a unanimous selection to the AP All-America First Team, and would receive further recognition, winning the Wooden Award, Naismith Trophy, and being named AP player of the year. Meanwhile, Coach Grant received national coach of the year accolades from Sporting News, as well as winning both the AP coach of the year and Naismith coach of the year award. Finally, ESPN College Gameday made its first ever visit to the Dayton campus on March 7, 2020, highlighting the #3 ranked Flyers and their passionate fan base prior to the final game of the season, a 76\u201351 victory over George Washington.\nThe fourth season under Anthony Grant started out promising, led by a trio of Senior Guards in Jalen Crutcher, Ibi Watson, and Rodney Chatman, they picked up two wins against SEC foes in Ole Miss and Mississippi State. Unfortunately injuries, along with PF Chase Johnson leaving the team yet again, led to the team under performing. They did pick up a strong road win against 23rd ranked Saint Louis, giving them a perfect 1\u20130 record versus AP ranked teams on the season, as well as advancing to the quarterfinals of the 2021 Atlantic 10 tournament. Following the conclusion of the A10 tournament, they earned a bid into the shortened 2021 NIT tournament as a four seed. All games were played at a neutral site in Texas, acting as a \"bubble\". The team lost in the first round after a close game against #1 seed and eventual champions Memphis.\nThe Flyers signed their highest rated high school prospect ever in 2020 when DaRon Holmes II agreed to play for the Flyers. Alongside Georgia transfer and future NBA player, Toumani Camara and highly rated freshman point guard Malachi Smith, Holmes' freshman season yielded upsets of Elite Eight bound Miami and eventual National Champion Kansas en route to their second ESPN Events Invitational championship.  The 2021-22 team would finish second in the Atlantic 10, but falter in the semi-finals of the conference tournament to Richmond when Malachi Smith suffered an ankle injury. The loss to Richmond and their eventual A-10 tournament championship made Dayton the first team out of the 2022 NCAA tournament. The Flyers would accept an invite to the NIT where they would beat Toledo before falling in overtime on the road to Vanderbilt.\nThe 2022-23 team began the year with high expectations, ranked #24 in the preseason polls and rising as high as #21.  However, an injury plagued trip to the Bahamas for the 2022 Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament resulted in the loss of starting guards Smith and Kobe Elvis, putting the season in jeopardy. Despite this setback, the Flyers regrouped to again finish second in the A-10 regular season, but fell in the conference tournament championship game to VCU, despite a tournament MVP performance by Holmes. Citing injuries, the Flyers declined all post season tournament invites.\nHolmes and Camara tested the NBA draft waters following the 2022\u201323 season. Camara was drafted in the second round by Phoenix, but Holmes withdrew from the draft to return to the Flyers for his junior season. The Flyers were again preseason favorites to win the A-10, but a season ending injury to starting point guard Malachi Smith seven minutes into their first game again threatened to derail the Flyers. Nevertheless, the team reached the championship of the 2023 Charleston Classic and defeated rival Cincinnati heading into conference play. Led by Holmes and Koby Brea, the 2023-2024 NCAA leader in 3-Point Percentage at 50%, the Flyers would enter the AP poll mid-season and remain there through all but one week of the remainder of the season, reaching as high as #16.  The Flyers would receive a 7-seed in the West Region of the 2024 NCAA tournament where they would defeat Nevada in dramatic comeback fashion for their first NCAA tournament win since 2015. The Flyers would fall to Arizona in the Round of 32. DaRon Holmes received recognition as the A-10 co-player of the year, and was a consensus Second Team All-American, the second Flyer in five years to receive All-American honors. \nFollowing the conclusion of the 2023-2024 season, Holmes would declare for the NBA draft where he would be selected in the 1st round with the 22nd pick by the Denver Nuggets. Koby Brea would also depart, transferring to the University of Kentucky despite previous comments to the media about his intent to return for the 2024-2025 season. \nFollowing these departures, the 2024-2025 season would follow the path of many other flyer seasons under Anthony Grant. The Flyers would once again start the season off well, defeating 2nd ranked and back-to-back national champions UConn at the Maui invitational. They followed that up by defeating 6th ranked Marquette at UD Arena, leading to their brief appearance in the Top 25 as the 22nd ranked team in the country. The team would however falter in A10 play, picking up critical losses that ultimately left the team on the wrong end of the bubble. After a quarterfinal loss to Saint. Josephs in the A10 tournament, the flyers would receive a 1 seed to a depleted NIT field. After defeating FAU in the first round, the team would be knocked out by Chattanooga.\n\nAtmosphere\nThe Flyer Faithful\nThe Flyers are noted for their fan base, dubbed \"The Flyer Faithful.\" The Flyers are routinely in the top-30 in average game attendance among all NCAA Division I basketball programs. As a result of this support, UD Arena is regarded as not only an extremely challenging venue in which to play, but has been hailed as one of the greatest basketball atmospheres in all of college basketball. Additionally, this fan base is noted for its willingness to travel and enthusiastically support the Flyers in both neutral and hostile environments.\n\nRivalries\nDayton has historical rivalries with several area teams including Xavier, Miami (Ohio), and Wright State (Gem City Jam), as well as fellow Catholic schools such as Marquette, DePaul, and Notre Dame. Dayton has met Xavier 158 times, more than any other opponent, and holds an 84\u201375 edge in the series through 2019; however, the Flyers have struggled against Xavier in recent decades, posting a 19\u201345 record against the Musketeers over the past four decades. Dayton and Xavier played for the Blackburn/McCafferty Trophy.\nWith the departure of Xavier to the Big East in 2013, Dayton searched for a new Atlantic 10 rivalry game that involved a trophy. Each year Dayton plays Atlantic 10 rival Saint Louis University for the rights to the Arch Baron Cup. The team has developed a similar rivalry with the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Rams since the exit of Xavier from the Atlantic 10 in 2013.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Flyers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 19 times. Their combined record is 20\u201321.\n\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nNIT results\nThe Flyers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 28 times. Their combined record is 42\u201326. They are three time NIT champions (1962, 1968, 2010). The Flyers also turned down a 2023 NIT invitation due to health and safety concerns.\n\nAwards and Statistics\nAll-time statistic leaders\n1,000-point scorers\nThe Flyers currently have been 51 players who have scored 1,000 points as a Flyer.  Additionally, they have three other players who have transferred to UD and scored their 1,000th point in a Flyer uniform.\nRoosevelt Chapman is the all-time leading scorer at UD with 2,233 points.

    "summary": "The Dayton Flyers men's basketball team is a college basketball program that competes in NCAA Division I and the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) representing the University of Dayton in Ohio. The Flyers play their home games at University of Dayton Arena. The Flyers are coached by Anthony Grant who is in his seventh season. Dayton has appeared 19 times in the NCAA tournament, most recently in 2024.\nIn March 2020, Dayton was ranked #3 in the AP Top 25 Poll, its highest ranking since the 1955\u201356 season when it was ranked #2. The Flyers have never been ranked #1, but Dayton did receive a lone first place vote in the final AP poll of the 2019\u20132020 season. When the 2020 seasons was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Flyers did not get to participate in the 2020 NCAA Tournament, despite being projected as a #1 seed by several outlets.\nA 2015 study of college basketball team valuations placed Dayton No. 23 in the nation with 2014 adjusted revenues in excess of $16.6 million (highest for non-football conference programs) and a valuation of nearly $84 million (second highest for non-football conference programs and higher than programs such as Florida, Texas, and Michigan).",

    "biography": "The Drake Bulldogs men's basketball team represents Drake University, located in Des Moines, Iowa, in NCAA Division I basketball competition. The program is best known for making the 1969 Final Four. The Bulldogs have appeared eight times in the NCAA tournament, making their most recent appearance in 2025.\n\nHistory\nThe early years (1906\u20131959)\nThe first season Drake fielded a men's basketball team was 1906\u201307. The Bulldogs finished with a 2\u20131 record as an independent. The next year, during the 1907\u201308 season, they were charter members of the Missouri Valley Conference.\nDrake went on to dominate the 1930s, winning three conference titles in the decade (1934\u201335, 1935\u201336, and 1938\u201339). The Bulldogs did not qualify for a postseason tournament by winning the conference title, though, as no post-season tournaments were held during the 1934\u201335  season. The following 1935\u201336 season Drake was invited to the District Olympic Tournament post-season tournament (defeating North Dakota 49\u201346, falling to Minnesota 36\u201319). The Bulldogs participated in the National Intercollegiate Tournament in 1937\u201338 (losing to Murray State 47\u201340) and 1938\u201339 (losing to Oklahoma State 28\u201315).\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s Drake's winning streak secured eight winning seasons. There was no Missouri Valley Conference play during the 1943\u201344 and 1944\u201345 seasons because of World War II. This was in part because most MVC schools did not play basketball during those seasons. In 1951 Drake withdrew from the MVC, along with Bradley, in protest of the MVC's failure to discipline Oklahoma A&M in the Johnny Bright Incident. Drake would not compete in the Missouri Valley Conference again until the 1956\u201357 season.\n\n1960\u20131986\nDuring the 1960s through mid-1980s, the Bulldogs were in the national rankings on a regular basis and the MVC was one of the premier conferences in men's basketball. Drake had fourteen winning seasons during this time.\n\nMaury John era\nCoach Maury John had a Drake record 211 wins (211-131) coaching the Bulldogs from 1958 to 1971. John came to Drake after he had compiled a 285\u201358 record (.831) at Moberly Junior College (1946\u20131958) and led Moberly to back-to-back NJCAA National Championships in 1954 and 1955. (John was replaced by Cotton Fitzsimmons at Moberly when he came to Drake.) After Coach John, Howard Stacey compiled a 34\u201344 record coaching Drake from 1971 to 1974, Bob Ortegel compiled a 94\u2013103 record from 1974 to 1981 and Gary Garner was 95-104 from 1981 to 1988.\nUnder Coach John, Drake shared the 1963\u201364 Missouri Valley Conference title with Louisville and received an invitation to the 1964 National Invitation Tournament (NIT). In the NIT, Drake defeated Pittsburgh 87\u201382 in the first round and lost to tournament runner-up New Mexico 65\u201360 in the second round.\nThe 1968\u201369 Drake Bulldog season was by far the most accomplished in program history, as the Bulldogs advanced to the 1969 NCAA Final Four. The Bulldogs, under Coach John, won the Missouri Valley Conference outright and advanced to the 1969 NCAA Tournament Final Four, finishing third. During the tournament, Drake received a bye in the first round, defeated Texas A&M 81\u201363 in the Sweet Sixteen and Colorado State in the Elite Eight 84\u201377. The Bulldogs would fall to eventual champion UCLA with Coach John Wooden 85\u201382 in the national semifinal before routing North Carolina under Coach Dean Smith 104\u201384 in the third-place game.\nIn the 1969 NCAA Final Four, on March 20, 1969 in the National Semi-Final, Drake lost to UCLA with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Coach John Wooden 85\u201382. Drake, with 24 points from Willie McCarter, 13 points with 16 rebounds from Willie Wise, and defense from Rick Wanamaker and Dolph Pulliam, almost pulled off a historic upset. UCLA led 83\u201374 with one minute and 12 seconds remaining before Drake scored eight straight points to make the score 83\u201382 with just seconds remaining. (UCLA would go on to defeat Purdue (92\u201372) in the NCAA Championship game, their fourth of seven consecutive NCAA Championships.\nThe Los Angeles Times described the closing moments of the UCLA game: \"Late in the game, UCLA led by three, but Drake had the ball and the momentum. Guard Willie McCarter put up a jumper from the left corner that ricocheted around the rim before falling into the hands of Drake forward Dolph Pulliam, who went straight back up with it. On the way up, Pulliam was hammered by Alcindor and Curtis Rowe, but the ball somehow made it through the hoop. The basket counted, but no foul was called against the Bruins. Eight seconds remained, and Drake trailed by one. UCLA escaped the Bulldogs' full-court press and got a pass through to Lynn Shackelford. In desperation, Drake's Ron Gwin fouled him. Shackelford made both of his one-and-one attempts.\"\nAfter the game, Coach John Wooden was asked what had been wrong with UCLA. Wooden replied simply,\"Drake.\"\nIn the 1969 NCAA 3rd-place game, the Bulldogs defeated Coach Dean Smith's ACC Champion North Carolina Tar Heels, with Charlie Scott convincingly, 104\u201384, behind 28 points from Willie McCarter. Drake finished the season 26\u20135.\nDrake continued their success under Coach John in the next two seasons as they advanced to the Elite Eight of both the 1970 NCAA tournament and the 1971 NCAA tournament. Drake finished 22\u20137 in 1969\u20131970 and 21\u20138 in 1970\u20131971.\nIn the 1969\u201370 season once again captured the Missouri Valley Conference title and made their second straight NCAA tournament. Earning a bye in the first round, Drake defeated Houston, with Coach Guy Lewis and Dwight Davis, 92\u201387. Drake lost to New Mexico State 87\u201378 in the 1971 Midwest Regional Final.\nIn 1970\u201371, the Bulldogs earned their third straight Missouri Valley Conference championship. They made their third straight NCAA trip, qualifying for the 1971 NCAA tournament. There, Drake (21\u20138) defeated Notre Dame University with Austin Carr 79\u201372 in OT, then lost to Kansas 73\u201371 in the Midwest Regional Final.\nIn 1971, after 13 seasons and a Drake record 211 wins, Coach John left Drake for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. John's tenure at ISU was short, as he died of cancer on October 15, 1974 at the age of 55.\n\nBob Ortegel era\nDrake won their first national tournament title during the 1974\u201375 season, capturing the National Commissioners Invitational Tournament postseason title under Coach Ortegel. In the tournament, the Bulldogs defeated USC 80\u201370, Bowling Green 78\u201365, and Arizona in the championship game 83\u201376.\nThe Bulldogs also advanced to the National Invitational Tournament during the 1980\u201381 season, under Coach Ortegel, losing to Minnesota in the first round 90\u201377 and the 1985\u201386 season under Coach Gary Garner, falling to Marquette 79\u201359 in the first round.\n\n1987\u20132006\nFrom 1987 to 2006, Drake did not have a winning season in men's basketball; the stretch included a 2\u201326 season in 1996\u201397 and a 3\u201324 season in 1997\u201398. The Bulldogs went through four coaches, none of whom finished with a winning coaching record at Drake.\nIn the 2001\u201302 season Drake suspended four players at winter semester break due to their not abiding by the school's 2.0 GPA rule (NCAA requires 1.8), but despite having a depleted roster, the Bulldogs nearly eked out a winning season. Drake entered the MVC tournament with a 14\u201314 record; but fell to Illinois State 63\u201364 on a buzzer beating shot, ending the season 14\u201315.\nThe next season (2002\u201303) Drake would finish 10\u201320, leading to the dismissal of head coach Kurt Kanaskie at season's end.\n\nTom Davis era\nOn April 22, 2003, Drake announced the hiring of former Iowa head coach Dr. Tom Davis as its new men's basketball coach. The hiring drew national attention and brought instant credibility to the struggling program. Davis\u2019 career included sixteen 20-win seasons, 18 post season appearances, and he was named Associated Press National Coach of the Year in 1987.\nDuring the 2003\u201304 season, Davis began a massive rebuilding project of Bulldog basketball. After going 37\u201351 in his first three seasons, the team finished 17\u201315 in the 2006\u20132007 season for its first winning record in 21 years. Following the season, Davis resigned and was succeeded by his son Keno Davis.\n\n2007\u20132008 season\nUnder the guidance of Keno Davis, the 2007\u201308 season was one of the most storied in Drake history. The Bulldogs won the Missouri Valley Conference regular season and tournament titles, advancing the NCAA tournament. Drake earned a five seed in the NCAA tournament and they were ranked nationally throughout the year. While playing Western Kentucky, though, Ty Rodgers hit a last-second 26-foot three-point shot, giving Western Kentucky a 101\u201399 overtime victory in the first round. Drake finished the season with a school best 28\u20135 record.\n\n2008\u20132017\nAfter the successful 2007\u201308 season, Keno Davis accepted the head basketball coach position at Providence. As a result, Drake AD Sandy Hatfield Clubb hired former Arizona State assistant coach Mark Phelps. In 2008\u201309, Phelps' first season, the Bulldogs finished with a 17\u201316 record, falling in the College Insider Tournament to Idaho. Despite his ability to recruit, Phelps' on the court coaching led to finishes of 7th and below in the MVC and dwindling fan attendance and support. Phelps's contract was not renewed following the 2012\u201313 season, and Drake AD Sandy Hatfield Clubb replaced him with her new choice Ray Giacoletti. After failing to finish above .500 for three seasons and a 1\u20138 start in his fourth year, Giacoletti turned in his resignation to Drake AD Sandy Hatfield Clubb on December 6, 2016, and Interim Head Coach Jeff Rutter took over in his place, leading the team to their ninth play-in game in nine seasons under a coach chosen by Drake AD Sandy Hatfield Clubb.\nOn March 26, 2017, Drake University President \"Marty\" Martin named former Furman University head coach Niko Medved as head men's basketball coach.  After a 17\u201317 season that exceeded low expectations, Medved announced his departure from Drake, accepting an offer from Colorado State University on March 22, 2018, less than one year after his tenure at Drake began.\n\n2018\u20132024\nOn March 29, 2018, Creighton University assistant coach Darian DeVries was named the new head coach of the team. Devries led the Bulldogs to a regular season record of 23\u20138 and won the MVC Championship in his first year as head coach. Devries was named MVC Coach of the Year for his role in returning Drake to the top of The Valley.\nIn 2020, Drake hosted Northern Iowa in a nationally televised game which was also the first Knapp Center sell out since the 2007-08 season. Drake lost in humiliating fashion to their instate conference rival scoring a season low 43 points in route to a 70-43 loss. Six days later at Arch Madness Drake scored a revenge upset against Northern Iowa, becoming the first team in tournament history to upset a 1-seed in the quarterfinal round 77-56. Drake would lose in the semifinal round to eventual tournament champion Bradley. Although the NCAA tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic before brackets could be announced, the loss sent their instate rivals to the tournament bubble and many bracketologists expected the loss to cost Northern Iowa their chance at an at-large NCAA Tournament bid. Drake's upset also became the first time in school history a coach had led their team to back-to-back 20 win seasons in their first two seasons at the school.\nFor the 2020-21 season, Drake had an undefeated non-conference season and started the season with an 18-0 record, the best start in school history. The Bulldogs finished regular season with 24 wins to mark their third-straight 20-win season, a feat which had only previously happened once. The Bulldogs also equaled a school record with 15 Missouri Valley Conference wins.\nThe 2020-21 team made the program's first NCAA Tournament appearance in 13 years. Their First Four appearance against former MVC foe Wichita State on March 18 resulted in a 53-52 victory, which was the team's first win in the tournament in 50 years. The Bulldogs bowed out in the next round against the USC Trojans two days later, ending their season at 26-5.\nIn the 2022-23 season the team won the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament and returned to the NCAA Tournament as the number 12 seed in the Midwest Region loosing in the first round to #5 seed Miami 56-63. The Bulldogs finished the season 27 and 8. The Drake Bulldogs gymnasium was featured in the final scene of the 2023 Peacock streaming movie Champions starring Woody Harrelson, Matt Cook & Caitlin Olson.\nThe 2023-24 season was Drake's sixth straight season, all under Devries, with 20 or more wins and saw Drake go undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Drake received an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament and was selected as the No. 10 seed in the East Region, but lost to the #7 seed Washington State in the first round 61 to 66. After three NCAA appearances in four seasons, Devries left just three days after the conclusion of the season to become the head coach at West Virginia.\n\n2024\u201325 season\nThe 2024\u201325 season marked a new era for the Drake Bulldogs men's basketball program. Following the departure of head coach Darian DeVries to West Virginia after the 2023\u201324 season, Drake hired Ben McCollum as the program\u2019s new head coach in April 2024. McCollum, who previously led Division II powerhouse Northwest Missouri State to four national championships, was tasked with continuing the program\u2019s recent success at the Division I level.\nIn his first season at Drake, McCollum guided the Bulldogs to a 27\u20133 overall record and a 17\u20133 record in Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) play. The team captured its first outright MVC regular season championship since the 2007\u201308 season. Drake carried its momentum into the MVC Tournament, earning victories over Southern Illinois, Belmont, and Bradley to secure its third consecutive tournament title.\nDrake received an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament and was selected as the No. 11 seed in the West Region. In the first round, the Bulldogs defeated No. 6 seed Missouri 67\u201357, earning their first Round of 64 NCAA Tournament win since 1971. Their season came to an end in the second round after a hard-fought loss to Texas Tech.\nJunior guard Bennett Stirtz played a key role throughout the season, leading the team in scoring and assists. He was named the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player following his performance during the Bulldogs' championship run.\nOn March 24, 2025, McCollum accepted the head coaching position at the University of Iowa. Later that week, Drake announced the hiring of Eric Henderson, former South Dakota State head coach, to lead the program moving forward.\n\nDrake Bulldog head coaches\nList of Drake Bulldogs men's basketball head coaches\n\nRecord versus conference teams\nBelow are the records of the Bulldogs versus current members of the Missouri Valley Conference as of the 2024\u201325 regular season.\n\nMVC All-Centennial Team\nIn 2006\u201307, the Missouri Valley Conference celebrated its centennial as the nation's second-oldest NCAA Division I conference.

    "biography": "The Drexel Dragons men's basketball program represents intercollegiate men's basketball at Drexel University. The team currently competes in the Coastal Athletic Association in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and plays home games at the Daskalakis Athletic Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Drexel last appeared in the NCAA tournament in 2021.\n\nRivalries\nThe Dragons, a member of the City 6, have rivalries with multiple institutions, these include La Salle University, Temple University, University of Pennsylvania, Saint Joseph's University, and Villanova University.\nThe  most notable rivalry Drexel has is with Penn, nicknamed Battle of 33rd Street, one of the closest rivalries geographically.\n\nHistory\nAccording to Basketball-Reference.com, Drexel was the 5th US school to start up collegiate basketball, their first season being 1894\u20131895. Drexel's first basketball game was played against Temple College on November 22, 1894, which Drexel won by a score of 26\u20131. The Dragons joined Division I in 1974. Drexel has received bids to five NCAA basketball tournaments in 1986, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 2021. During the 1996 tournament, Malik Rose led the team to their only second round appearance after an upset of fifth-seeded Memphis. Prior to this, Drexel had appeared in four Division II NCAA tournaments in 1957, 1960, 1966 and 1967, including the very first Division II tournament in 1957. Drexel's men's basketball team was ranked as high as 35th nationally in 2007, finishing the season with a 23\u20139 record while making the National Invitational Tournament for the fourth time in the prior five years.\nOn February 22, 2018, Drexel came back from a 34 point deficit (trailing 53\u201319 at one point), coming back to defeat Delaware 85\u201383 to complete the largest comeback in Division I history.\n\nVenues\nMain Building\nBeginning in 1894, Drexel played their games and held all athletic activities in a gymnasium that was located in the 4th floor of the Main Building. This gymnasium was sometimes referenced as West Philadelphia College Court.\n\nCurtis Hall Gymnasium\nIn 1929, Curtis Hall, an extension of Drexel Main Building, was completed and included a new gymnasium.  The gymnasium was prioritized in construction to be completed 3 months before the rest of the building, in December 1928, in order to be completed prior to the start of the 1928\u201329 Drexel basketball season.  The gym featured a full-sized basketball floor, and separate locker rooms for the home and visiting teams.  This gym is known as Curtis Hall Gym, or Curtis Gym, and was also nicknamed \"The Band Box.\"  During construction of Curtis Hall, an entrance was added on Chestnut Street to allow quicker access to the gym.  The gymnasium had a seating capacity of 500. After moving home games to Sayre Junior High School, games were played in Curtis Hall again for one last season in 1953\u20131954, before they once again were relocated back to the high school.\n\nSayre Junior High School\nAs the popularity of the basketball and other sports teams grew, Curtis Hall Gym became less suitable for hosting the games. During the 1951\u201352 season, Drexel decided to move 3 of its 4 remaining league games to Sayre Junior High School, located in West Philadelphia. Drexel also played 6 of its 9 home games at the high school in the following 1952\u20131953 season. A single home games were scheduled at Curtis Hall in the 1953\u20131954 season, however the remaining home games would be played at Sayre High School. From that point forward, Sayre Junior High School served the home court for Drexel through the 1968\u20131969 season.\n\nDrexel Armory\nBeginning in the 1969\u20131970 basketball season, the Drexel home basketball games were moved to the 32nd Street Armory, also known as the Drexel Armory. Drexel first began holding various athletic and recreational activities in the armory in 1947, while the building was still state owned and used exclusively for National Guard and ROTC drills. While home games were moved out of the Armory after the 1974\u20131975 season, the armory was considered for renovation in the 2010s in order to make it suitable for hosting home basketball games. Instead, renovations were made at Daskalakis Athletic Center, allowing the DAC to continue to serve as the home court.\n\nDaskalakis Athletic Center\nSince the 1975\u20131976 season, the Dragons' home games have been played at the Daskalakis Athletic Center, formerly known as the Physical Education and Athletic Center (PEAC). While it was considered to move the games back to the Armory at one point, Drexel instead decided to renovate the Athletic Center beginning in 2012 and keep the games there instead.  Within the Daskalakis Athletic Center, games are played on Sam Cozen Court in the main gym.\n\nOther Venues\nDrexel previously held a number of home games at other local venues in Philadelphia. In the 1952\u201353 season when 6 of Drexel's 9 home games were played at Sayre Junior High School, 2 home games were played at Philadelphia Convention Hall (as was one game the previous season), and the final game was played at St. Joseph's Field House. In the 1950s and 1960s a number of Drexel home games were also played in The Palestra.\nSince moving to the Armory in the 1969\u20131970 season, it has become rare for home games to be played at alternative venues. In the 1995\u201396 season, Drexel played their first game at the CoreStates Spectrum in Philadelphia against conference rival Delaware, however it was considered a neutral site game. In the 2015\u201316 season Drexel played what was considered a home game against Penn State at The Palestra, and also played a home game at The Palestra against Temple in the 2018\u201319 season. However, in many seasons, Drexel has played games at the Palestra that were considered a neutral game statistically, even while serving as a seldom used \"home\" court for the team's higher demand games. For example, on January 21, 1987, Drexel beat No. 18 ranked Navy at the Palestra, which was considered a neutral site (rather than an alternate home court) according to NCAA records. In the 1987\u201388 season, Drexel played 3 games at the Palestra that were considered at home. The designation of the Palestra being a neutral site or an alternate home court has varied over the years.\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA Division I Tournament results\nThe Dragons have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament five times.

    "biography": "The Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team represents Duke University in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The team is fourth all-time in wins of any NCAA men's basketball program, and is currently coached by Jon Scheyer.\nDuke has won five national championships (tied with Indiana for fifth all-time behind UCLA, Kentucky, North Carolina and UConn), and appeared in 11 national championship games (third all-time) and 18 Final Fours (third all-time). Duke has an NCAA-best .755 NCAA tournament winning percentage. Eleven Duke players have been named the National Player of the Year, and 72 players have been selected in the NBA draft, six of which were selected first overall (most all-time). Additionally, Duke has had 36 players named All-Americans (60 total selections) and 14 players named Academic All-Americans. Duke has been the Atlantic Coast Conference Champions a record 23 times, and also lays claim to 21 ACC regular season titles. Prior to joining the ACC, Duke won the Southern Conference championships five times. Duke has also finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll eight times and is the all-time leader in total weeks ranked as the number one team in the nation by the AP with 145 weeks. Additionally, the Blue Devils have the third longest streak in the AP Top 25 in history with 200 consecutive appearances from 1996 to 2007, trailing only Kansas' 231 consecutive polls from 2009 to 2021, and UCLA's 221 consecutive polls from 1966 to 1980.\n\nTeam history\nEarly years (1906\u20131953)\nIn 1906, Sydney Colon, Trinity College's Athletic Director and a member of the Class of 1900, introduced the game of basketball to Trinity. The January 30 issue of The Trinity Chronicle headlined the new sport on its front page. Trinity's first game ended in a loss to Wake Forest, 24\u201310. The game was played in the Angier B. Duke Gymnasium, later known as The Ark. The Trinity team won its first title in 1920, the state championship, by beating the North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering (now NC State) 25 to 24. Earlier in the season they had beaten the University of North Carolina 19\u201318 in the first match-up between the two schools. Trinity college then became Duke University.\nBilly Werber, Class of 1930, became Duke's first All-American in basketball. The Gothic-style West Campus opened that year, with a new gym, later to be named for Coach Card. The Indoor Stadium opened in 1940. Initially it was referred to as an \"Addition\" to the gymnasium. Part of its cost was paid for with the proceeds from the Duke football team's appearance in the 1938 Rose Bowl. In 1972 it would be named for Eddie Cameron, head coach from 1929 to 1942.\nIn 1952, Dick Groat became the first Duke player to be named National Player of the Year. Duke left the Southern Conference to become a charter member of the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953. The Duke team under Vic Bubas made its first appearance in the Final Four in 1963, losing 94\u201375 to Loyola Chicago in the semifinal. The next year, Bubas' team reached the national title game, losing to the Bruins of UCLA, which claimed the first of that program's 10 titles in the next 12 years. Bob Verga was Duke's star player in 1967.\n\nBill Foster (1974\u20131980)\nThe basketball program won its 1000th game in 1974, making Duke only the eighth school in NCAA history to reach that figure. In a turnaround, Coach Bill Foster's 1978 Blue Devils, who had gone 2\u201310 in the ACC the previous year, won the conference tournament and went on to the NCAA championship game, where they fell to Kentucky. Gene Banks, Mike Gminski ('80) and Jim Spanarkel ('79) ran the floor.\n\nMike Krzyzewski (1980\u20132022)\nMike Krzyzewski was at Duke from 1980 to 2022.\n\n5 National Championships \u2013 2nd most all time, the last being in 2015\n13 Final Fours as well as five in a row from 1988 to 1992\n17 Elite Eights\n26 Sweet Sixteens and nine straight from 1998\u20132006\n36 NCAA tournament berths\n101 NCAA tournament wins (most ever)\n14 No. 1 seeds\n28 conference titles (13 regular season, 15 tournament), 10 of the 13 ACC Tournament Titles from 1998\u201399 through 2010\u201311\n15 30-win seasons\n36 20-win seasons\nNumber 1 AP ranking in 17 of the past 28 seasons\n8 Naismith College Player of the Year Awards\n9 National Defensive Players of the Year Awards\n26 AP All-Americans\n14 consensus first team All-Americans\n11 NBA top-10 picks: T-1st\n23 NBA Draft first round picks\n1,202 career wins\nKrzyzewski's teams made the Final Four in 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2010, 2015 and 2022.\n\nIn Krzyzewski's first season, the Blue Devils would finish the season with a 17\u201313 overall record and 6\u20138 record in ACC play. The team would later play in the NIT tournament advancing to the quarterfinals. Despite having a good record the previous season, the Blue Devils would struggle during the next two seasons finishing with 10 wins in 1982 and 11 wins in 1983. The 1984 team, led by Tommy Amaker & Johnny Dawkins, would bounce back in strong fashion finishing 24\u201310 and was ranked the No.14 in the AP and Coaches poll, but lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament to the Washington Huskies (having earned a first-round bye).\nIn 1985 Duke defeated Pepperdine in the first round of the NCAA tournament, for Krzyzewski's first tournament win, but lost to Boston College in the second round 74\u201373. The next season the Blue Devils made their first Final Four under Krzyzewski. They beat Kansas to advance to the title game against Louisville, where they ultimately lost 72\u201369.\n\nDuke upset the heavily favored UNLV Runnin' Rebels 79\u201377 in the Final Four in 1991, a rematch of the 1990 final in which Duke lost by 30 points. The team, led by Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley, Grant Hill, and Thomas Hill, went on to defeat Kansas 72\u201365 to win the university's first NCAA Championship. Ranked #1 all season and favored to repeat as national champions in 1992, Duke took part in a game \"acclaimed by many [as] the greatest college basketball game ever played,\" according to ESPN. In the Elite Eight, Duke met the Rick Pitino-led Kentucky Wildcats. It appeared Kentucky had sealed the win in overtime when guard Sean Woods hit a running shot off the glass in the lane to put Kentucky up by one with 2.1 seconds left on the clock. After a timeout, Duke's Grant Hill threw a full-court pass to Christian Laettner. Laettner took one dribble and nailed a turn-around jumper at the buzzer to send Duke into the Final Four with a 104\u2013103 victory (The Shot). Duke went on to defeat sixth-seeded Michigan, led by the Fab Five as freshmen starters including Chris Webber, Jalen Rose and Juwan Howard, 71\u201351 to repeat as national champions. Following the successful repeat, Laettner was the only collegiate player to be chosen for the Dream Team that won Olympic gold in Barcelona, while Krzyzewski was an assistant coach under Chuck Daly of the Detroit Pistons in a precursor to his becoming Team USA coach in 2006 and coaching them to two gold medals.\nThey would later meet Kentucky for another classic regional final game, but blow a 17-point second half lead in losing to the Wildcats. The Blue Devils would lose the 1994 title game to Arkansas and their \"Forty Minutes of Hell\" defense. The next two seasons would see them fall to just 31\u201331, though they made the 1996 tournament with an 18\u201312 record, 8\u20138 in conference play. They would also fall in the 1999 title game, this time to Jim Calhoun and the UConn Huskies. Duke defeated Arizona 82\u201372 to win its third NCAA Championship in 2001, becoming one of a handful of teams in NCAA Tournament history to defeat all of their tournament opponents by double digits. Krzyzewski was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame later that year. On April 5, 2010, Duke Men's Basketball won their fourth NCAA Championship by defeating Butler 61\u201359. On April 6, 2015, Duke's Men's Basketball won their fifth NCAA Championship by defeating Wisconsin 68\u201363.\nCoach K announced that the 2021\u201322 season would be his last coaching for Duke. Making it to the Final Four one last time, Duke fell just short of the championship game losing to the North Carolina Tar Heels 81\u201377 in the first ever meeting between the rivals in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nJon Scheyer (2022\u2013present)\nOn June 2, 2021, Scheyer was named as the next head coach at Duke following Krzyzewski's retirement at the end of the 2021-22 season. On March 11, 2023, he became the first person to win an ACC tournament title as both a coach and a player.\nFormer Duke stars such as Jim Spanarkel, Gene Banks, Alaa Abdelnaby, Johnny Dawkins, Cherokee Parks, Bobby Hurley, Antonio Lang, Roshown McLeod, William Avery, Trajan Langdon, Grant Hill, Danny Ferry, Christian Laettner, Kenny Dennard, Brian Davis, Elton Brand, Shane Battier, Carlos Boozer, Chris Duhon, Mike Dunleavy Jr., Dahntay Jones, Daniel Ewing, JJ Redick, Shavlik Randolph, Shelden Williams, Corey Maggette, Luol Deng, Josh McRoberts, Gerald Henderson, Andre Dawkins, Austin Rivers, Lance Thomas, Kyle Singler, Miles Plumlee, Mason Plumlee, Marshall Plumlee, Bob Verga, Quinn Cook, Nolan Smith, Jason Williams, Jabari Parker, Rodney Hood, Seth Curry, Kyrie Irving, Matt Jones, Amile Jefferson, Jahlil Okafor, Tyus Jones, Justise Winslow, Grayson Allen, Brandon Ingram, Luke Kennard, Jayson Tatum, Harry Giles, Frank Jackson, Gary Trent Jr., Trevon Duval, Marvin Bagley III, Wendell Carter Jr., RJ Barrett, Marques Bolden, Cam Reddish, Zion Williamson, Tre Jones, Vernon Carey Jr., Cassius Stanley, Jalen Johnson, Paolo Banchero, Mark Williams, Wendell Moore Jr., Trevor Keels, AJ Griffin and Dereck Lively II have gone on to play in the NBA.\nMany of Krzyzewski's assistants and former players, such as Tommy Amaker (Seton Hall, University of Michigan and Harvard), Bob Bender (Illinois State University and University of Washington), Chuck Swenson at William & Mary, Mike Brey (Delaware and Notre Dame), Jeff Capel (VCU, Oklahoma and Pittsburgh), Chris Collins (Northwestern), Johnny Dawkins (Stanford, UCF), Quin Snyder (Missouri, Utah Jazz, Atlanta Hawks), Steve Wojciechowski (Marquette), and JJ Redick (Los Angeles Lakers) have become head basketball coaches at major universities and the NBA, while Pete Gaudet is now the head coach of the India women's national basketball team.\n\nTeam captains\nResults by season (1980\u20132024)\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1978 edition.\n\nNational championships\nFinal Four history\nComplete NCAA tournament results\nThe Blue Devils have appeared in the NCAA tournament 47 times.

Their combined record is 5\u20136.\n\nKey statistics\nAs of the 2017\u201318 season, the Blue Devils' program record is as follows.\n\nDuke has been ranked as the #1 team in the nation 235 weeks in their history.\nDuke had not lost a non-conference game at Cameron from 2000 until 2019, when SFASU beat Duke in overtime (85\u201383). Duke maintains a tradition of hosting the previous season's Division II national champion in an exhibition game each November.\n\nCameron Indoor Stadium\nCameron Indoor Stadium was completed on January 6, 1940, having cost $400,000.  At the time, it was the largest gymnasium in the country south of the Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Originally called Duke Indoor Stadium, it was renamed for Coach Cameron on January 22, 1972. The building originally included seating for 8,800, though standing room was sufficient to ensure that 12,000 could fit in on a particularly busy day. Then, as now, Duke students were allowed a large chunk of the seats, including those directly alongside the court. Renovations in 1987\u20131988 removed the standing room areas and added seats, bringing capacity to 9,314.\n\nCameron Crazies\nDuke's men's basketball teams have had a decided home-court advantage for many years, thanks to the diehard students known as the Cameron Crazies. The hardwood floor has been dedicated and renamed Coach K Court in honor of head coach Mike Krzyzewski, and the tent city outside Cameron where students camp out before big games is known as Krzyzewskiville. In 1999, Sports Illustrated ranked Cameron the fourth best venue in all of professional and college sports, and USA Today referred to it as \"the toughest road game in the nation\".\n\nPlayer awards\nRetired numbers\nNational Players of the Year\nDick Groat Helms, UPI\nArt Heyman AP, UPI, U.S. Basketball Writers\nJohnny Dawkins  Naismith\nDanny Ferry  Naismith, UPI, U.S. Basketball Writers\nChristian Laettner  AP, Basketball Times, NABC, Naismith, Rupp, U.S. Basketball Writers, Wooden\nElton Brand  AP, NABC, Naismith, Rupp, U.S. Basketball Writers, Wooden, Sporting News\nShane Battier  AP, Basketball Times, Naismith, Rupp, U.S. Basketball Writers, Wooden, Sporting News\nJay Williams  AP, Basketball Times, NABC (2), Naismith, Rupp, U.S. Basketball Writers, Wooden, Sporting News\nJJ Redick AP, Basketball Times, NABC, Naismith, Rupp (2), U.S. Basketball Writers, Wooden, Sporting News\nMarvin Bagley III, NABC\nRJ Barrett, Wooden, USA Today\nZion Williamson AP, NABC, Naismith, U.S. Basketball Writers, Wooden, Sporting News\nCooper Flagg U.S. Basketball Writers, NABC\n\nACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year\nACC Rookies of the Year\nNational Defensive Player of the Year\nTommy Amaker (1987)\nBilly King (1988)\nGrant Hill (1993)\nSteve Wojciechowski (1998)\nShane Battier (1999, 2000, 2001)\nShelden Williams (2005, 2006)\n\nACC Defensive Player of the Year\n(since 2005)\n\nShelden Williams (2005, 2006)\nDeMarcus Nelson (2008)\nTre Jones (2020)\nMark Williams (2022)\n\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\nMike Krzyzewski (2001)\nGrant Hill (2018)\n\nMcDonald's All-Americans\nThe following 78 McDonald's All-Americans have signed and played for Duke. \n\n \n\n1977 \u2013 Gene Banks\n1978 \u2013 Vince Taylor\n1982 \u2013 Johnny Dawkins\n1983 \u2013 Tommy Amaker & Martin Nessley\n1985 \u2013 Danny Ferry & Quin Snyder\n1986 \u2013 Alaa Abdelnaby & Phil Henderson\n1988 \u2013 Christian Laettner & Crawford Palmer\n1989 \u2013 Bobby Hurley & Billy McCaffrey\n1990 \u2013 Grant Hill\n1991 \u2013 Cherokee Parks\n1992 \u2013 Chris Collins\n1993 \u2013 Joey Beard\n1994 \u2013 Trajan Langdon, Ricky Price & Steve Wojciechowski\n1995 \u2013 Taymon Domzalski\n1996 \u2013 Nate James\n1997 \u2013 Elton Brand, Shane Battier & Chris Burgess\n1998 \u2013 Corey Maggette\n1999 \u2013 Carlos Boozer, Mike Dunleavy Jr., Casey Sanders & Jay Williams (basketball)\n2000 \u2013 Chris Duhon\n2001 \u2013 Daniel Ewing\n2002 \u2013 Sean Dockery, JJ Redick, Shavlik Randolph & Michael Thompson\n2003 \u2013 Luol Deng\n2004 \u2013 DeMarcus Nelson\n2005 \u2013 Eric Boateng, Greg Paulus & Josh McRoberts\n2006 \u2013 Gerald Henderson Jr., Jon Scheyer & Lance Thomas\n2007 \u2013 Taylor King, Kyle Singler & Nolan Smith\n2008 \u2013 Elliot Williams\n2009 \u2013 Ryan Kelly & Mason Plumlee\n2010 \u2013 Kyrie Irving\n2011 \u2013 Quinn Cook, Marshall Plumlee & Austin Rivers\n2012 \u2013 Amile Jefferson & Rasheed Sulaimon\n2013 \u2013 Matt Jones & Jabari Parker\n2014 \u2013 Grayson Allen, Tyus Jones, Jahlil Okafor & Justise Winslow\n2015 \u2013 Brandon Ingram, Chase Jeter & Luke Kennard\n2016 \u2013 Marques Bolden, Frank Jackson & Jayson Tatum\n2017 \u2013 Wendell Carter Jr., Trevon Duval & Gary Trent Jr.\n2018 \u2013 RJ Barrett, Tre Jones, Cam Reddish & Zion Williamson\n2019 \u2013 Vernon Carey Jr., Matthew Hurt & Wendell Moore Jr.\n2020 \u2013 Jeremy Roach, DJ Steward, Mark Williams\n2021 \u2013 Paolo Banchero & AJ Griffin\n2022 \u2013 Dereck Lively II, Mark Mitchell & Dariq Whitehead\n2023 \u2013 Jared McCain & Sean Stewart\n2024 \u2013 Isaiah Evans & Cooper Flagg\n\nCurrent Blue Devils in the NBA & International leagues\nAs of October 7, 2024, these former Blue Devils players were in the NBA:\n\nFormer Blue Devils in International leagues\nJavin DeLaurier \u2013 Promitheas Patras B.C.\nTrevon Duval \u2013 Manisa B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir Belediyespor\nHarry Giles III - Shanxi Loongs\nJacob Grandison \u2013 Vilpas Vikings\nJordan Goldwire \u2013 Lobos Plateados de la BUAP\nMatthew Hurt \u2013 South East Melbourne Phoenix\nFrank Jackson \u2013 Nanterre 92\nJahlil Okafor \u2013 Capitanes de Arecibo\nJabari Parker \u2013 FC Barcelona\nJustin Robinson \u2013 Elitzur Netanya B.C.\nCassius Stanley \u2013 Hapoel Afula B.C.\nRasheed Sulaimon \u2013 KK Budu\u0107nost\nDerryck Thornton \u2013 Leicester Riders\nJordan Tucker \u2013 Chorale Roanne Basket\nJack White \u2013 Melbourne United\n\nRivalries\nThe Duke\u2013North Carolina rivalry is often ranked among the top rivalries in both college basketball and all North American sports. Entering the 2023 - 2024 season, North Carolina leads the rivalry, winning 141 games to Duke's 115. The Duke Blue Devils face the North Carolina Tar Heels twice each year during ACC play, with thousands of Duke undergraduate students participating in an annual tradition of camping out in Krzyzewskiville, a lawn in front of Cameron Indoor Stadium, for months to line up for admission into the rivalry game. The two teams always face each other for their last game of the regular season, with the home team hosting their Senior Night. Some years, the two teams meet for a third game in the ACC tournament. The teams have met twice in post-season tournament play.  In 2022, the two schools met in the Final Four to face each other in the NCAA Tournament for the first time. In that game, the Tar Heels defeated the Blue Devils 81\u201377.  In 1971 the two rivals met in the semi-finals of  the NIT, a game also won by North Carolina by a score of 73 - 69.  Duke also has rivalries with NC State and Wake Forest, and together with UNC, the 4 schools form Tobacco Road.\nDuke and North Carolina have combined for 11 national championships, with North Carolina leading Duke 6\u20135. The intensity of the rivalry is augmented by the proximity of the two universities, located only ten miles apart along U.S. Highway 15\u2013501 (also known as Tobacco Road) or eight miles apart in straight-line distance in the cities of Durham and Chapel Hill. In addition, Duke is a private university whereas North Carolina is a public school; the vastly different funding structures and cultures between the two further contribute to the intensity of the rivalry.\nFormer Esquire editor and author (and North Carolina graduate) Will Blythe argues that the rivalry's passion can be attributed greatly to class and culture in the South.\n\nTo legions of otherwise reasonable adults, it is a conflict that surpasses sports; it is locals against outsiders, elitists against populists, even good against evil... The rivalry may be a way of aligning oneself with larger philosophic ideals \u2014 of choosing teams in life \u2014 a tradition of partisanship that reveals the pleasures and even the necessity of hatred.\n\nThe rivalry has been the subject of various books and articles, including To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever by Blythe and Blue Blood by Art Chansky.\nFurther illustrating the intensity of the rivalry, U.S. Representative Brad Miller, a die-hard Carolina fan, told an Associated Press writer in 2012, \"I have said very publicly that if Duke was playing against the Taliban, then I'd have to pull for the Taliban.\"\nHowever, also due to the close proximity of the two schools, there is respect and collaboration within the rivalry. Inspired by the men's basketball teams, twenty-four students from the two schools got together from January 14\u201316, 2006 in order to attempt to break the world record for the longest continuous game of basketball ever recorded. The game set a new world record at 57 hours, 17 minutes and 41 seconds with Duke winning the game 3699\u20133444. All $60,000 raised from the marathon benefited the Hoop Dreams Basketball Academy, an organization which helps children with life-threatening illnesses develop successful life skills through basketball.\nBeyond athletics, the school papers have also engaged in the rivalry. As a tradition, one day prior to a Duke-North Carolina basketball game, The Chronicle, Duke's student newspaper, publishes a spoof cover page for the day's edition with the title The Daily Tar Hole. Contained within are satirical stories poking fun at The Daily Tar Heel and the North Carolina Tar Heels.  The Daily Tar Heel typically publishes former columnist Ian Williams' \"Insider's guide to hating Duke\" for the two basketball match-ups each year.  There is a longstanding agreement that if Duke wins the first matchup, The Daily Tar Heel's masthead is printed in Duke blue, and if North Carolina wins the first matchup, The Chronicle's masthead is painted Carolina blue. The losing school's paper also has to put the other school's logo in a conspicuous location and claim that the winning school is \"still the best.\"\nThe Michigan Wolverines and the Maryland Terrapins basketball teams have also claimed rivalries against the Blue Devils, but Duke has long rejected both claims and considers North Carolina to be its only rival.\n\nBy the numbers\nAll-time wins \u2013 2,271\nAll-time winning percentage \u2013 .712\nNCAA championships \u2013 5\nNCAA tournament runner-up \u2013 6\nAll-Americans \u2013 49 players\nACC regular season titles \u2013 23\nACC tournament titles \u2013 23 (most all-time)\nNCAA championship games \u2013 11\nNCAA Final Fours \u2013 18\nNCAA tournament appearances \u2013 47\nNCAA tournament wins \u2013 121\nNo. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament \u2013 14\nNumber of weeks ranked all-time in the top 25 of the AP Poll \u2013 870\nNumber of times defeating the No. 1 ranked team in the country \u2013 10\n\nVictories over AP No. 1 team\nDuke has 10 victories over the AP number one ranked team.\n\nJanuary 27, 1958 \u2013 NR Duke 72, No. 1 West Virginia 68\nDecember 10, 1965 \u2013 No. 8 Duke 82, No. 1 UCLA 66\nDecember 11, 1965 \u2013 No. 8 Duke 94, No. 1 UCLA 75\nMarch 11, 1984 \u2013 No. 16 Duke 77, No. 1 North Carolina 75\nMarch 26, 1988 \u2013 No. 5 Duke 63, No. 1 Temple 53\nMarch 30, 1991 \u2013 No. 2 Duke 79, No. 1 UNLV 77\nDecember 5, 1992 \u2013 No. 4 Duke 79, No. 1 Michigan 68\nNovember 26, 1997 \u2013 No. 4 Duke 95, No. 1 Arizona 87\nFebruary 22, 2014 \u2013 No. 5 Duke 66, No. 1 Syracuse 60\nNovember 26, 2021 \u2013 No. 5 Duke 84, No. 1 Gonzaga 81\n\nSee also\nKrzyzewskiville\nCameron Crazies\nDuke Blue Devils women's basketball\nMike Krzyzewski\nJon Scheyer\n\nFootnotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

Duke has been the Atlantic Coast Conference Champions a record 23 times, and also lays claim to 21 ACC regular season titles. Prior to joining the ACC, Duke won the Southern Conference championships five times. Duke has also finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll eight times and is the all-time leader in total weeks ranked as the number one team in the nation by the AP with 145 weeks. Additionally, the Blue Devils have the third longest streak in the AP Top 25 in history with 200 consecutive appearances from 1996 to 2007, trailing only Kansas' 231 consecutive polls from 2009 to 2021, and UCLA's 221 consecutive polls from 1966 to 1980.",

    "biography": "The Duquesne Dukes represent Duquesne University in college basketball. The team, which started in 1914, has only ever played in NCAA Division I and has had six appearances in the NCAA Tournament. The Dukes play in the Atlantic 10 Conference, of which they have been members since 1976 (minus the 1992\u201393 season in which the Dukes were single-season members of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference). Their head basketball coach is Dru Joyce III.\nThe Dukes men's basketball team has had great success over the years, playing twice in national championship games in the 1950s and winning the National Invitation Tournament championship in 1955. Duquesne also emerged victorious in the 1976\u201377 Eastern Collegiate Basketball League (the forerunner to the Eastern Athletic Association, now known as the Atlantic 10 Conference) tournament and 2024 Atlantic 10 tournament. The Dukes were also 1979\u201380 and 1980\u201381 Eastern Athletic Association regular-season co-champions. The Associated Press ranked Duquesne as the No. 1 college basketball team in the country for two consecutive weeks during the 1953\u201354 season. They reached (and lost) the A10 tournament final in 1981 and 2009 before finally winning the conference tournament in 2024 and snapping the 47-year appearance drought in the NCAA tournament.\nDuquesne is the only school to have back-to-back first overall picks in the National Basketball Association draft (Dick Ricketts by the Saint Louis Hawks in 1955 and Sihugo Green by the Rochester Royals in 1956). The Dukes men's basketball program can also claim the first African-American player selected in an NBA draft (Chuck Cooper by the Boston Celtics in 1950). The 1939\u201340 Dukes basketball team finished with a 20\u20133 record and appeared in the Final Four of both the NIT and NCAA Tournaments. Duquesne has had the most Atlantic 10 scoring champions in conference history.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe history of basketball at Duquesne University can be dated back to 1914, when the university administration established basketball as a varsity sport. The first game, against Bethany College, was won in a gym under the college chapel on January 9, 1914 (Rishel 23). The team was first coached by Alexander Hogarty, whose tenure lasted only one season. The position was filled by Father Eugene McGuigan, who was called \"Father Mac\" on campus and \"Coach Gene Martin\" in newspaper reports in order to prevent the name of a Holy Ghost father from being associated with the rowdiness of \"Basket-ball\". Father McGuigan coached football, baseball, and basketball until he was transferred from Duquesne University in 1923 (Rishel 38).\nWhen a proper gymnasium was constructed in 1923, Duquesne Basketball was finally allowed to come into its own, as the previous court was in reality a stage below the chapel and was not only slanted but demarcated by a steel cage on its perimeter. Teams had previously refused to play the \"Bluffites\" on their home court. Coach \"Chick\" Davies initiated a new era in the basketball program, filling the 1,200-seat gymnasium and bringing the team into national prominence. In its first season with Davies, Duquesne tied with Waynesburg University for the Tri-State Conference championship and dominated the same conference in 1926 and 1927 before moving to a higher level of competition. The season expanded from 20 to 28 games and became more competitive in 1930 when the team faced the University of Iowa, Loyola University Chicago, Adrian College, Elmhurst College, Alfred State College, John Carroll University, American University, Catholic University, Colgate University, St. Bonaventure University, Seton Hall University, Manhattan College, and the City College of New York. Davies, immensely popular, coached Duquesne basketball until 1948 (Rishel 40\u201341).\n\nWorld War II era\nThe university tried to hold on to basketball during World War II, having reworked the gymnasium in 1942 to seat an extra 800 spectators, but was forced to drop the sport at the end of the 1943 season (Rishel 81\u201382). However, the sport was reinstated in the spring of 1946. During the 1946\u20131947 season Davies led the Dukes to 19 straight victories before a loss to Georgetown University. In that same season, Duquesne received its third invitation to the NIT, losing by one point to the University of Utah, the eventual champion, which it had defeated during the regular season (Rishel 101).\nDuring this first postwar season, the University of Tennessee refused to play a scheduled game against Duquesne at the McKeesport (PA) Vocational High School because the Dukes had a black player--Chuck Cooper. The December 23, 1946, game had been highly anticipated since Tennessee had two All-Americans and four other returning lettermen. As Davies refused to remove Cooper from the squad, Tennessee canceled at the last minute. In 1950, Cooper became the first African-American drafted to play professional basketball when he joined the Boston Celtics (Rishel 101).\n\nMid-century success\nDukes Basketball continued to impress with a new coach in the 1948\u201349 season--Donald \"Dudey\" Moore, who had also played for Duquesne. In the 1949\u201350 season, Moore's team achieved a 17\u20135 record in the 1948\u201349 season, and in 1950, 23 wins and another bid to the NIT. By the 1950s, Duquesne's Locust Street gym had become inadequate to seat the team's spectators, so games were usually played in a high school gym in McKeesport or the Duquesne Gardens in Oakland. Even at this point, daily practice was held at North Catholic High School (Rishel 102).\nThe 1950s marked an age of immense success for Dukes Basketball, with Moore leading his team to six NIT bids (1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956). The team went 21\u20131 during the 1951\u201352 regular season and was the top seed in the tournament. Moore was named \"Coach of the Year\" by the New York Basketball Writers Association. In 1953, Duquesne was rated as a preseason \"best in the East\" and possibly the nation. With a 23\u20132 record, they were top seed for the NIT that year. Although they lost to the College of the Holy Cross, they achieved a new record of 26 victories in a season. Top-seeded again in '54, Duquesne, following a 19\u20134 regular season, finally won the title of NIT Champions in 1955 (Rishel 137\u2013138).\nThe 1956 season almost came to an early end, as the Duquesne Gardens, then Duquesne's home court, was to be demolished. However, in a gesture which athletic director Doc Skender called \"one of the finest acts of sportsmanship I've ever known,\" long-standing rival the University of Pittsburgh allowed the Dukes use of the Fitzgerald Field House for home games (Rishel 138).\nCoach Red Manning, initially unpopular, soon led the Dukes to another era of postseason play, ending up in the Final Four in the 1962 NIT tournament, with further appearances in the NIT in 1964, 1968, and 1970, plus appearances in the NCAA Tournament in 1969 and 1971.\nNotable in this decade was Willie Somerset, nicknamed by the press as \"Wonderful Willie.\" Though only 5'11\", he could jump higher than any other player on the team (Rishel 177).\n\n1970s to 1990s\nThe 1970s saw the end of Manning's tenure. Duquesne had seen only four different basketball coaches in fifty years, but this decade alone saw three coaches: Red Manning, John Cinicola, and Mike Rice. The decade was relatively lackluster, although it saw the likes of \"the greatest guard in Duquesne basketball history\"--Norm Nixon (Rishel 216). The 1980s were marked by problems with many players' academic eligibility\u2014calling into question the university's recruiting and support procedures\u2014and are best described as \"trying times\" for the Dukes (Rishel 246). There were only two winning seasons in the decade--'80\u201381 and '85\u201386. Even so, the 1988 construction of the A. J. Palumbo Center\u2014Duquesne Basketball's current home\u2014is a notable event of this time period.\n\n21st century\nThe Dukes have had mixed success in the 21st century, reaching one NCAA Tournament (reaching the second round in 2024), one NIT Tournament (eliminated in the first round in 2009) and four College Basketball Invitational tournaments (twice making the second round). Despite coming off a second straight winning season and losing to Temple in the Atlantic 10 Conference Championship Game in 2009, coach Ron Everhart was fired after the 2011\u20132012 season; the university cited a lack of postseason success as the main reason for the firing. Jim Ferry was hired but failed to improve the team's performance and was fired in 2017 with an overall record of 60-97. Keith Dambrot was hired away from Akron and coached the team to a bid in the 2024 NCAA Tournament as an 11 seed after winning the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament for the second time. They defeated the 6th-seeded BYU Cougars in the first round 71-67, their first NCAA tournament win in 55 years.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Dukes have appeared in the NCAA Tournament six times. Their combined record is 5\u20136.\n\nNIT results\nThe Dukes have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 17 times. Their combined record is 17\u201319. They were NIT champions in 1955.\n\nCBI results\nThe Dukes have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) four times. Their combined record is 2\u20134.\n\nNational Campus Basketball Tournament results\nThe Dukes appeared in the only National Campus Basketball Tournament. Their record is 0\u20131.\n\nRetired numbers\nOn January 27, 2001, during the halftime of a game against Xavier University, the Duquesne University Department of Athletics retired the jersey numbers of five of its all-time greatest players: Chuck Cooper, Sihugo Green, Norm Nixon, Dick Ricketts and Willie Somerset.

  "Florida Atlantic Owls": {
    "biography": "The Florida Atlantic Owls men's basketball team represents Florida Atlantic University and competes in the American Conference of NCAA Division I college basketball. Their home games are played on the Abessinio Court in the Eleanor R. Baldwin Arena on the school's Boca Raton, Florida campus. The Owls have appeared in the NCAA tournament three times: in 2002, 2023, and 2024. The Owls joined Conference USA (C-USA) in 2013 as part of the early-2010s NCAA conference realignment. After not winning a single NCAA Tournament game coming into 2023, the Owls qualified for their first Final Four in program history by defeating the Kansas State Wildcats 79\u201376. After the 2022\u201323 season, FAU left C-USA for the American Conference.\n\nOverview and history\nFlorida Atlantic University basketball began play in the 1988\u201389 season. The Owls competed as an NCAA Division II independent until the 1993\u201394 season, when they moved up to Division I and the Atlantic Sun Conference, now known as the ASUN Conference. After spending 11 seasons in the Atlantic Sun, the Owls moved to the Sun Belt Conference, with the rest of Florida Atlantic University's intercollegiate sports teams. The Owls moved to C-USA in July 2013, and then moved to The American in July 2023.\n\nBeginning: FAU gets basketball (1988\u20131993)\nFlorida Atlantic University played its first-ever intercollegiate basketball contest on November 18, 1988, against fellow local NCAA Division II school, Palm Beach Atlantic University.  The Owls won the game 111\u201362.  Even though the newly formed college squad hung 111 points in their first game, they would finish the inaugural season 9\u201319, which included a 12-game losing streak in the middle of the year.  Head coach, Lonnie Williams, was known to be a \"program-builder\", but after one year, left FAU after its first season to become head coach at the University of California, Davis. Williams would only last one year at UC Davis, posting an 11\u201316 record.\nReplacing Williams was Penn State assistant coach, Tim Loomis.  Loomis started his coaching career with a 21\u20137 record, and followed that up with back-to-back 15\u201313 seasons.  The three consecutive winning seasons is a feat that no other Owls coach has ever matched, until Dusty May did it in his first three seasons.  Along with the winning seasons, Loomis was able to schedule games against neighbor and powerhouse, University of Miami Hurricanes.  Though Miami would beat the Owls soundly in the appearances, the ability to schedule games against them was seen as the Owls basketball program's growth.  Loomis would lose the core of that inaugural team after the Owls' fourth season, and the Owls would suffer devastating 3\u201324 (1992\u201393) and 3\u201325 (1993\u201394) seasons the latter being their first official year as Division One.  The members of these teams were true pioneers and super fundraisers for the athletic department as they hit the road to play teams like Florida State, Georgetown, and Iowa State while taking large paydays and suffering losses to higher ranked (#10 Georgetown) opponents.  In fact, Loomis' team beat NC State on the road in 1993\u201394 to become the first Atlantic Sun team to ever beat an ACC team at the time.\n\nMove to Division I (1993\u20132005)\nThe 1993\u201394 season would mark the beginning of the Owls competition in the NCAA Division I.  The Owls joined the Atlantic Sun Conference later, mostly due to the fact that the Owls baseball team was exceeding expectations so early in its development.  In 1994\u201395, the team improved to 9\u201319 while in Loomis' last year.  The team repeated that win total in 1995\u201396 under new coach Kevin Billerman but showed improvement by taking South Florida, Saint Louis, and Southern Illinois to close road losses determined by the last possession, while winning two conference games to end the season.  Former Duke Blue Devil captain and leader, Kevin Billerman, was hired to further lead the Owls into Division I; his second season produced the most wins of any Division One FAU men's basketball coach up to that point.  Due to NCAA's rule, the Owls were not eligible for the NCAA tournament for four years, with their first season of tournament eligibility coming in 1993\u201394.  In Billerman's four seasons, the Owls had two 20+ loss seasons (his last two) and only one winning season (his second).\nFor the 1999\u20132000 season, FAU hired decorated UNLV All-American forward/center and NBA first-round draft pick Sidney Green.  In his first season, Green's Owls went 2\u201328, with a 25-game losing streak in the middle of the season.  In each of his first and second seasons, the Owls would win their opening round game in the Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament, but would lose in the second round.\n\n2001\u201302 season: A-Sun champions\nDuring the 2001\u201302 season, Green would lead the Owls to his only winning season, as FAU finished 19\u201312 and 13\u20137 in the Atlantic Sun.  In the first-round of the 2002 Atlantic Sun Conference Tournament, FAU would again win their opening game, this time defeating Jacksonville University.  The Owls would break their second-round losing tradition, beating Jacksonville State University.  In the Atlantic Sun Conference Championship, the Owls faced Georgia State University and won 76\u201375, clinching their first conference championship and a bid to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nIn the 2002 NCAA tournament, the Owls were seeded as a 15-seed, and placed in the South Region, and were paired with 2-seed Alabama.  Though the Owls hung tight throughout the game, heavily favored Alabama held on to win 86\u201378.\n\nCoaching carousel (2005\u20132018)\nGreen was fired after the 2004\u201305 season and the Owls landed former NCAA Coach of the Year and Tar Heel Matt Doherty.  Doherty led the Owls to a 15\u201313 record and then left abruptly to become the head coach at Southern Methodist University.\nWith the rapid success of the football program, created from scratch just in 2001, the Florida Atlantic sports programs again moved up in level of competition.  This time, the Owls would move to the Sun Belt Conference, and basketball played its first season of competition in the Sun Belt in the 2006\u201307 season.  To replace Doherty, assistant coach and former Kansas Jayhawk star, Rex Walters, was elevated.  In his first season, Walters' Owls were 16\u201315 and 10\u20138 in the Sun Belt.  The 16\u201315 marked the first time FAU posted back-to-back winning seasons since the 1989\u201390 and 1990\u201391 seasons.  The 10\u20138 conference record was only the fourth time the Owls had a winning record in conference play.  Walters' sophomore season regressed a bit, as FAU finished 15\u201318. After the 2007\u201308 season completed, Rex Walters accepted the head coaching job at the University of San Francisco, and for the third time in four years, the Owls were searching for a new coach.\nFAU hired Mike Jarvis as their new coach. Jarvis had been the head coach at Boston University, George Washington University and, most recently, St. John's University. Between the three schools, Jarvis led his teams to nine total NCAA tournament appearances, including an Elite Eight appearance with St. John's in 1999.  Jarvis was fired from St. John's on December 19, 2003\u2014the first Big East Conference coach to be fired during the season. It later emerged that school officials had fired Jarvis in part due to a series of embarrassing off-court incidents. Among these, a junior college transfer had been charged with assaulting a female student, and a senior guard had been kicked off the team after being caught smoking marijuana near St. John's campus in Queens. During the 2003\u201304 season, St. John's center Abe Keita claimed that a member of Jarvis's basketball staff had paid him nearly $300 a month for the past four seasons. As a result, St. John's placed itself on two years' probation, withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2004\u201305 season, and forfeited 43 wins including the 2002 NCAA Tournament and the 2003 NIT. Jarvis was faulted for not properly monitoring Keita's situation. After his ouster, Jarvis was criticized for ignoring New York City's rich pool of high school players, which particularly rankled fans used to seeing national powerhouses built primarily on New York City talent. At FAU, he looked to become the first coach in NCAA basketball history to win 100 games at four different schools. Following the 2014 season, Jarvis resigned after reports indicated that he was going to be fired. He finished with a 76\u2013112 after six years in Boca Raton.\nOn April 7, 2014, the school hired Michael Curry, a former NBA player and coach of the Detroit Pistons. Curry's teams never finished with more than 12 wins overall or more than six wins in conference. They never finished higher than 11th in C-USA. Following the hiring of a new athletic director, Brian White, Curry was fired after four seasons at the school and a 39\u201384 record.\n\nDusty May era and 2023 Final Four run (since 2018)\nWhite, brother to then-Florida head coach Mike White, thanked Curry for his years at FAU, but saw no reason the Owls could not compete in C-USA. On March 22, 2018, the school hired Florida assistant coach Dusty May as head coach.\nThe FAU Owls began to experience much improved results and consistent success under May, as they finished that first season in 2018-19 with an above .500 record at 17-15 and an invite to the 2019 CIT, where they lost to the Charleston Southern Buccaneers in the first round, 68-66. The Owls followed that success with winning records in each of the first 5 seasons with Dusty May at the helm.\nThe 2022-23 FAU Owls, led by May, had their most successful season in program history, going 31-3 en-route to winning that season\u2019s Conference USA Championship for both the regular season and the conference tournament. During that season, FAU was ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 for the first time in school history, as they at one point won 20 consecutive games. In March of 2023, the Owls made the NCAA Tournament for only the second time in program history and remarkably, made it to the Final Four in Houston after defeating the Kansas State Wildcats 79-76 in the Elite Eight at Madison Square Garden. The Owls then narrowly lost to the San Diego State Aztecs in that Final Four, 72-71, as San Diego State\u2019s Lamont Butler hit a buzzer-beating jumpshot to help the Aztecs advance to the 2023 NCAA Tournament National Championship Game. The 2022-23 FAU Owls finished the season 35-4, the most wins of any program in Men\u2019s Division I College Basketball that season.\nDespite making the Final Four and rumors of players transferring the following season, FAU ran it back with their squad for the 2023-24 season. The team finished 25-9, making their second-straight March Madness appearance. However, FAU lost in the first round of the 2024 NCAA Tournament to the Northwestern Wildcats, 77-65, in overtime at the Barclays Center.\n\nJohn Jakus enters the scene\nAfter making it to two straight NCAA Tournament appearances, head coach Dusty May left FAU to take a job with the Michigan Wolverines. It was a five year deal worth $18.75 million in base compensation.\nAs a result of May's departure, FAU lost their star players to the transfer portal. FAU's leading scorer Johnell Davis transferred to Arkansas. Alijah Martin transferred to Florida. Nick Boyd transferred to San Diego State. Giancarlo Rosado transferred to Charlotte. Vlad Goldin joined May and transferred to Michigan.\nIn replace of May, FAU hired John Jakus as their new head coach on March 27, 2024.\n\nHead coaches\nCurrent coaching staff\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Owls have appeared in the NCAA tournament three times.

    "biography": "The Florida Gators men's basketball team represents the University of Florida in the sport of basketball.  The Gators compete in NCAA Division I's Southeastern Conference (SEC). Home games are played on Billy Donovan Court in the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center on the university's Gainesville campus.\nWhile the University of Florida's men's basketball team first took the court in 1915, the program did not receive much support from the university for several decades. The basketball team did not have a permanent home court with adequate seating capacity until the Florida Gymnasium opened in 1949, and did not hire a full-time basketball coach until Norm Sloan in 1960, and did not play in a modern arena until the O'Connell Center opened in 1980. Early highlights included the program's first postseason appearance in the 1969 National Invitation Tournament with the Gators' first All-American Neal Walk, a run to the Sweet Sixteen during its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1987 under head coach Norm Sloan, and another surprise tournament run to the 1994 Final Four under head coach Lon Kruger. However, consistent success was elusive, and the Gators often found themselves in the bottom half of the SEC basketball standings.\nThe trajectory of Florida's basketball program changed with the hiring of head coach Billy Donovan in 1996. After having made five NCAA Tournament appearances and having won only two regular season SEC championship and zero SEC tournaments in 78 seasons of basketball before his arrival, the Gators won six SEC regular season championships and four SEC tournament championships, appeared in 14 NCAA Tournaments, reached four Final Fours, and won back-to-back national championships (2006 and 2007) during Donovan's 19 seasons in Gainesville before he left to coach in the NBA in 2015. Under Donovan, Florida's successes were notable as a school with a popular and dominant football team, as they remain the only school to have won the national championship in both sports in the same year (2007).\nTodd Golden became the Gators' head basketball coach in March 2022. After struggling in his first season, Golden was able to establish stability within the program, returning to the NCAA tournament in 2024. In 2025, Todd Golden led the Gators to a 36\u20134 record, SEC Tournament championship, and the program's third national championship.\n\nSchedule overview\nThe college basketball season begins in early November, and the non-conference portion of the schedule typically runs until the end of the calendar year. The Gators usually compete in a cross-regional tournament against other top programs, schedule a game or two against other quality opponents in Gainesville or on the road, and play their annual game against in-state rival Florida State before the conference portion of the schedule begins.\nThe 18-game Southeastern Conference (SEC) slate usually tips off around the beginning of the calendar year. The schedule consists of home-and-home games against five SEC teams mixed in with single games against each of the other eight SEC teams followed by the conference tournament. Florida has built in-conference rivalries with Kentucky and Tennessee since the Gators began consistently competing for conference titles in the 1990s.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe modern University of Florida (UF) was created when the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act of 1905, which consolidated four predecessor institutions into a new flagship university that opened its new Gainesville campus in 1906. The school sponsored its first varsity basketball team during the 1915\u201316 school year under head football coach C. J. McCoy, who led the basketball team to a 5\u20131 record against small colleges and local athletic clubs. The program went on hiatus during World War I and next took the court during the 1919\u201320 school year, though without an officially designated coach. Head football coach William G. Kline was assigned to coach basketball during the 1920\u201321 school year, when the team moved into their new home at recently completed University Gymnasium.\n\nThe \"New Gym\" and Alligator Alley\nBy the mid-1920s, the basketball team had outgrown the small brick University Gymnasium, which had been designed to serve as a student recreation center and had very little spectator space. A larger wooden structure was built directly adjacent to the University Gym in 1928. While it was officially known as \"Building R\", it was commonly called the \"New Gym\". The New Gym was intended to be a temporary home for the basketball team until the school could afford a more permanent structure. However, funds soon became scarce with the coming of the Great Depression, and university president John J. Tigert's main focus was the financing and construction of Florida Field, the new football stadium which opened in 1930. Plans for a larger brick gymnasium were drawn up in 1940, but construction was delayed by World War II, and the Gators finally moved to the Florida Gymnasium (also known as Alligator Alley) during the 1949\u201350 season.\n\nSoutheastern Conference membership\nIn December 1932, the University of Florida joined the Southeastern Conference as one of its 13 charter members. While the school would find athletic success in some sports, Florida's basketball team would spend most of the first half-century of SEC play in the bottom half of the standings, as the Gators finished the season higher than fourth in the league on only four occasions over the program's first fifty years in the SEC (1933 to 1983). Until 1960, the university continued the practice of assigning coaches from other sports to lead the basketball team, including head baseball coaches Brady Cowell, Ben Clemons and Sam McAllister, head football coach Josh Cody, and football assistants Spurgeon Cherry and John Mauer. This was common practice at most SEC schools apart from Kentucky well into the 1940s and 1950s, and some of Florida's coaches had experience in the sport, as Cody had previously coached basketball at Clemson and Vanderbilt and Mauer had previously coached basketball at Kentucky and Tennessee. However, none of these part-time coaches were able to build the Gators into consistent contenders in conference play.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s: Sloan and some success\nIn hopes of breathing life into the program, 34-year-old Citadel head coach Norm Sloan was hired as Florida's first full-time head basketball coach for the 1960\u201361 season. Sloan's first team notched the Gators' first winning conference record in eight years, and his second repeated the feat. Overall, his Florida squads compiled a record of 85\u201363 in six seasons during the 1960s, including the Gators' first regular season win over long-dominant Kentucky in SEC play.  Sloan's Gators did not receive a postseason tournament invitation during his tenure, as tournament fields were smaller at the time and only conference champions were assured of NCAA bids. Nonetheless, according to Florida historian Norm Carlson, Sloan \"elevated the Gators basketball program from a seldom competitive program and built the grass roots.\" Sloan left Florida after failing to receive the support of then athletic director Ray Graves, and took over as head coach at his alma mater North Carolina State after the 1965\u201366 season.\n\nTommy Bartlett succeeded Sloan as head coach, and his first season as head coach in 1966\u201367 was the program's most successful to date. The Gators with a record of 21\u20134, finishing 2nd in the SEC to Tennessee, who beat them twice during the regular season. Florida was ranked in the AP top 10 for the first time, earning a number 10 ranking on January 9, 1967, and then a number 8 ranking the next week on January 16. Florida notched the school's first 20-win campaign on the strength of winning their final eight games of the year by an average of 19 plus points per game. Ironically at the time the SEC would only permit the league champion to play in the postseason. Having finished second, they lost to league champion Tennessee twice and were not invited to a postseason tournament. Bartlett's squads finished fifth and third in conference play the following seasons. Led by the program's first All-American in center Neal Walk (the only Gator to have his number retired) and forward Andy Owens, the 1968\u201369 Gators received a bid to the 1969 National Invitation Tournament, the first postseason appearance in program history. After Walk and Owens went on to play professional basketball, Bartlett could not sustain the level of talent in recruiting, and team performance declined thereafter, with four straight losing campaigns leading to his dismissal.  John Lotz, a respected assistant under North Carolina's Dean Smith, succeeded Bartlett in 1973\u201374.  Lotz's Gators peaked with a 17\u20139 overall record and a fourth-place conference finish (10\u20138 SEC) in 1976\u201377, but trailed off to consecutive last place conference finishes in 1978\u201379 and 1979\u201380, leading to his dismissal.\n\nThe 1980s: Sloan returns, success and scandal\nThe modern era of Florida basketball began in 1980, when the team moved into their current home, the O'Connell Center. Despite being only 30 years old, Florida Gym had not aged well. By the mid-1970s, Florida was the only basketball program in the SEC without a modern arena. The university built the O'Connell Center (which quickly gained the nickname \"The O'Dome\") as the new home for all of the university's indoor sports programs, and it proved to be a boon across several sports.\nThe new facility improved the basketball program in several ways, including helping to convince Norm Sloan to return to Gainesville after a successful 14-year tenure at North Carolina State which included an undefeated season in 1972\u201373 and an NCAA championship in 1974. Sloan later said that he'd always enjoyed his first stint at Florida, and had always been more than willing to return if the university built a more modern arena.\nSloan's second stint at Florida was easily the most successful period in program history until the late 1990s. That success was in large part because Sloan persuaded several top Florida high school basketball players\u2014such as Gainesville's Vernon Maxwell and Brandon's Dwayne Schintzius\u2014to stay in-state instead of attending schools with more basketball tradition. After four years of rebuilding, Sloan led the Gators to the 1984 NIT, which was only the second postseason appearance in school history. They would make the NIT again in 1985 and 1986, reaching the NIT semi-finals in 1986.  In 1987, shooting guard Vernon Maxwell led the team to the school's first ever NCAA Tournament appearance, advancing all the way to the Sweet 16. Sloan coached the team to 20-win seasons and NCAA tournament appearances again the following two years, and led the Gators to the school's first-ever SEC regular season title in 1989 behind center Dwayne Schintzius.\nHowever, after a drug scandal involving Maxwell and an NCAA investigation for various rules violations, Sloan and his coaching staff were forced to resign on October 31, 1989, just days before the start of the 1989\u201390 season.  Former Tennessee coach Don DeVoe was brought in as the interim coach, but the defending SEC champions struggled to a 7\u201321 record. In September 1990, the NCAA sentenced the program to two years' probation for numerous major violations dating back to 1985. Their 1987 and 1988 NCAA Tournament appearances were erased from the record books due to Maxwell being retroactively declared ineligible for secretly taking money from a sports agent, and Sloan was slapped with a five-year show-cause penalty that effectively ended his coaching career.  The most severe penalty in the long run, however, was a reduction to 13 total scholarships in 1991\u201392 and 14 in 1992\u201393, which affected the program for several years. Draconian as those penalties were, the NCAA said that it would have banned the Gators from postseason play and live television in 1990\u201391 had Sloan still been coach. (Maxwell's 1987 and 1988 season statistics were later restored on September 18, 2025, making him again as Florida basketball's career leading scorer.)\n\nLon Kruger era 1990-1996\nLon Kruger, former head coach at Kansas State, took over the program before the 1990\u201391 season.  Despite the probation he inherited, Kruger slowly brought the team to increased success and reached the NIT semifinals in his second year as coach.  In 1993\u201394, the pieces fell into place for Florida to have their best season ever at that time.  Behind Andrew DeClercq and Dametri Hill, the Gators went to their first Final Four following a dramatic victory over UConn where Donyell Marshall missed two free throws with no time on the clock to force overtime, where the Gators eventually prevailed.  They lost to Duke in the national semifinal, 70\u201365.  The next year, they returned to the NCAA tournament, but were eliminated in the first round.  Kruger's final season in 1995\u20131996 resulted in a losing record, and he left to coach at Illinois.\n\nBilly Donovan era 1996-2015\nFlorida's Athletic Director, Jeremy Foley, looking for a young coach with a proven track record, hired 30-year-old Billy Donovan, then at Marshall, as Kruger's replacement.  His recruiting prowess was evident early, bringing future NBA star Jason Williams with him from Marshall and having early recruiting classes with future NBA players Mike Miller, Udonis Haslem, and Matt Bonner, among others.  The Gators made the NCAA tournament every year from 1999 to 2007, a nine-year streak that is the school record, and the sixth-longest NCAA Tournament streak.\n\nRebuilding to a Final Four\nDonovan's first two seasons at Florida proved to be the two worst during his tenure at Florida. The Gators posted a two-year win\u2013loss record of 27\u201332, missing postseason play entirely in his first season, and losing in the first round of the NIT in his second season. These were the last losing records that the Gators suffered until 2014\u201315.\nIn his third season, however, Donovan's Gators finished the season with an overall record of 22\u20139, and earned the No. 6 seed in the West Regional of the 1999 NCAA tournament.  The Gators defeated Penn and Weber State to advance to the Sweet Sixteen in Phoenix, where they were upset by No. 10 seed Gonzaga.\nDonovan took his Gators on a memorable run during his fourth season in Gainesville. The Gators finished the season 29\u20138, including winning a share of the SEC championship. In the 2000 SEC tournament, however, the Gators were upset in the second round by Auburn. Florida received the No. 5 seed in the East Regional of the 2000 NCAA tournament, though the Gators had to survive an upset bid by Butler on Mike Miller's buzzer-beating floater in overtime. They then swept through the region by beating Illinois, Duke, and Oklahoma State to reach the Final Four. In the national semifinals, Florida knocked off North Carolina to advance to their first NCAA national championship game, before losing to heavily favored and top seeded Michigan State.\nOver the next five years the Gators went to the NCAA Tournament every year, but they found themselves upset victims five straight times in the first or second round. In the 2001 NCAA tournament, Florida received the No. 3 seed in the South Region.  They defeated No. 14 Western Kentucky in the first round, but they were then upset by the No. 11 seed, Temple.\nThe following year, in 2002, the Gators received the No. 5 seed in the Midwest Region of the 2002 NCAA tournament. They were knocked off in the first round by No. 12 seed Creighton. The 2003 Florida Gators finished the season 24\u20137, and received the No. 2 seed in the South Region of the 2003 NCAA tournament. The Gators easily defeated Sam Houston State in the first round, but were then upset by No. 7 seed Michigan State in the second round.  In 2004, the Gators were the No. 5 seed in the East Rutherford Regional of the 2003\u20132004 NCAA tournament, but were upset in the first round by the No. 12 seed, Manhattan.\nThe 2004\u201305 team had the distinction of being the first to garner an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, when it defeated Kentucky in the 2005 SEC tournament championship. The Gators subsequently received the No. 4 seed in the Syracuse Regional of the 2004\u20132005 NCAA tournament.  They knocked off the No. 13 seed, Ohio in the first round, but lost to No. 5 seed Villanova in the second round.\n\n2005\u201306: First NCAA national championship season\nThe 2005\u201306 team began the season unranked and went on a 17\u20130 winning streak for the best start in school history, surprising many with a young (four sophomores and one junior) squad following the graduation of David Lee and the departures of Matt Walsh and Anthony Roberson to the NBA.  The trio accounted for 60 percent of their offense in 2005. The team faded late in the regular season, losing its last 3 games in February and entering the postseason with a 24\u20136 record, yet still managed to win its second consecutive SEC tournament championship.\nThe Gators entered the 2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a No. 3 seed with a 27\u20136 record, and ranked No. 10 by the AP.  They beat No. 14 seed South Alabama and No. 11 seed Milwaukee to advance to the Minneapolis regional.  There, the Gators defeated the No. 7 seed Georgetown Hoyas and upset the No. 1 seed Villanova Wildcats 75\u201362 to avenge their loss in the previous year's tournament and move on to their second Final Four under Donovan.\nFlorida defeated the upstart George Mason Patriots, the No. 11 seed from the Washington, D.C. regional, by a score of 73\u201358 in the national semifinals in Indianapolis.  On April 3, 2006, the Gators defeated the UCLA Bruins 73\u201357 in the national final to win the school's first men's basketball NCAA Championship.  The University of Florida Athletic Association then purchased the floor used in Indianapolis for the Final Four, and installed it in the O'Connell Center.\n\n2006\u201307: Second NCAA national championship season\nThe Gators returned all five starters from their 2006 championship team to begin the 2006\u201307 basketball season ranked as the preseason No. 1 in both major media polls, a first for the Gators.  The Gators locked up the SEC Championship relatively early in the 2006\u201307 season and were in possession of a 24\u20132 record before going on a late-February 1\u20133 skid that mirrored their 0\u20133 run a year earlier.  For the second season in a row, the losses in February would be their last.  Florida closed out Kentucky on Senior Night to end the regular season 26\u20135, and won their third straight SEC tournament championship with relative ease, beating Georgia, Ole Miss, and Arkansas 77\u201356.\nFlorida entered the 2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as the No. 1 overall seed in the tournament, and they advanced to the Final Four after wins in the regional against No. 5 seed Butler and No. 3 seed Oregon.  In a rematch of the 2006 title game, the Gators again eliminated the UCLA Bruins in the national semifinal.  Florida defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes 84\u201375, in a rematch of a game they won 86\u201360 three months earlier, to become the first team since the 1991\u201392 Duke Blue Devils to win back-to-back national championships and the first college team ever to repeat as national champions with the same starting line-up. The University of Florida also has the distinction of being the only school in NCAA history to have won both the basketball and football national championships in the same season (won the football championship in January 2007, which was the 2006 season) and the only school in NCAA history to win a combined four national championships in three seasons (football in 2006 and 2008 and basketball in 2006 and 2007). Also during this season, Donovan passed Sloan as the winningest coach in school history. Lee Humphrey, the team's shooting guard became the all-time leader for three-point shots made in the NCAA Tournament and all-time leading three-point scorer at Florida.\nThe starting five of Brewer, Green, Horford, Humphrey, and Noah nicknamed themselves \"the 04s\" (pronounced \"oh-fours\") since they enrolled at Florida in 2004. They were known for their camaraderie on and off the court, as Brewer, Green, Horford and Noah were roommates during their entire time in college. Following the 2006\u201307 season, three of the Gators' starting five were drafted among the first ten picks in the first round of the 2007 NBA draft: Horford (third), Brewer (seventh), and Noah (ninth). Taurean Green and Chris Richard were both selected in the second round. All five starters and sixth man Chris Richard later played professionally. All of them, except Humphrey, were selected in the 2007 NBA draft. Horford went on to become a five-time NBA All-Star center and won the 2024 NBA Finals with the Boston Celtics. Noah also became an NBA All-Star center and was named the 2014 NBA Defensive Player of the Year with the Chicago Bulls.\n\n2008\u20132010: Rebuilding\nIn the aftermath of the Gators second NCAA championship, Donovan accepted the head coaching position for the NBA's Orlando Magic on May 31, 2007.  On June 3, however, it was disclosed that Donovan asked to be released from his contract with the Magic, which was announced when he was reintroduced as the Gators head coach on June 7.\nThe Gators failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament in 2008 and 2009.  The Gators were eliminated by UMass in the semi-finals of the 2008 National Invitation Tournament.  The following season, the Gators were eliminated by Penn State in a quarter-final game of the 2009 National Invitation Tournament.  In 2010, the Gators received an invitation to the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a No. 10 seed, but they were eliminated in the first round by No. 7 seed BYU in double overtime.\n\n2011\u20132013: Three straight Elite Eight appearances\nIn the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the Gators were the No. 2 seed in the Southeast region after winning the SEC Championship, after being defeated in the 2011 SEC men's basketball tournament championship game to Kentucky, and finishing with a 26\u20137 record. They played their two first games in Tampa, Florida.  In the Second Round of the Tournament, Florida beat No. 15 seed, UC Santa Barbara Gauchos.  In the third round, the Gators defeated the No. 7 seed, the UCLA Bruins to advance to the Sweet Sixteen in New Orleans.  On March 24, 2011, the Gators got some revenge by defeating the No. 3 seed, BYU, who had knocked them out of the NCAA Tournament the year before, by a score of 83\u201374 in overtime to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2007.  Their tournament run ended there as they were stunned in the Regional Final against No. 8 seed Butler in overtime.\nIn the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the Gators were the No. 7 seed in the West Region after losing in the 2012 SEC men's basketball tournament semifinals to Kentucky, finishing with an overall record of 23\u201310.  Florida defeated the No. 10 seed, Virginia, and the No. 15 seed, Norfolk State, to advance to the Sweet 16 in Phoenix.  They defeated No. 3 seed Marquette in an upset to advance to the Elite Eight, but their run ended when they were defeated by the No. 4 seed, Louisville, 72\u201368, after blowing a 65\u201354 lead with 8:14 remaining in the game.\nThe 2012\u201313 Gators finished the regular season with an overall record of 24\u20136, and won the SEC Championship with a conference record of 14\u20134. During the regular season, Billy Donovan notched his 400th career win as the head coach of the Gators over Missouri. After losing in the final of the 2013 SEC men's basketball tournament to Mississippi, they entered the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as the No. 3 seed in the South Region.  Florida defeated the No. 14 seed Northwestern State 79\u201347 in the first round, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen after soundly beating the No. 11 seed, Minnesota, 78\u201364.  The Gators then defeated Florida Gulf Coast, No. 15 seed, in the Sweet Sixteen 62\u201350.  But once again, their run ended in the Elite Eight, this time against fourth seeded Michigan, who handily defeated the Gators, 79\u201359.  The Gators became the first team since the expansion of the tournament in 1951 to lose in the Elite Eight in three consecutive seasons.\nFlorida is the only program in the nation to have advanced as far as the Elite Eight in each of those seasons from 2011 to 2013.\n\n2014: Return to Final Four\nThe 2013\u201314 Gators finished the SEC regular season with an 18\u20130 record in conference play, the first SEC team to ever accomplish the feat, after the SEC re-expanded to an 18-game regular season schedule prior to the 2012\u201313 season.  In doing so, the Gators won their seventh SEC championship, and their third in four seasons. The Gators then beat the Kentucky Wildcats for the third time in the season to claim their fourth SEC Tournament championship title.\nBy claiming the SEC tournament, the Gators earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, and were selected as the No.1 overall seed, and were placed in the South Regional. The Gators' school record win streak reached 30 as they defeated their first four tournament opponents by double digits, finally breaking through in the Elite 8 with a 62\u201352 win over Dayton to advance to the Final Four as the only remaining No.1 seed. In the national semifinals, Florida faced Connecticut, which had been the last team to defeat them back on December 2, 65\u201364. The Gators got off to a quick start and built a 16\u20134 lead, but the Huskies were able to catch up and led 25\u201322 at halftime in a defensive battle. The Gators continued to struggle to score in the second half and suffered their third (and worst) loss of the season, 63\u201353.\nThe team's program-best 36\u20133 record resulted in many individual honors. Billy Donovan was named the SEC's Coach of the Year for the third time. Senior point guard Scottie Wilbekin was named Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year, the SEC Tournament MVP, and the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA South region. Senior center Patric Young was named the Defensive Player and Scholar-Athlete of the Year, junior forward Dorian Finney-Smith was named Sixth Man of the Year, and senior guard Casey Prather was named to the All-SEC First Team.\n\n2015: First losing record in 17 years\nThe 2014\u201315 Gators finished the season 16\u201317, 8\u201310 in SEC play to finish in a tie for eighth place.  They did not participate in a postseason tournament for the first time in 17 years.  The woeful season included losses to in-state rivals Miami and Florida State, and three losses to SEC champion Kentucky.  The Gators' 63.7 points-per-game were their lowest in the 19-year coaching tenure of Billy Donovan.  After the season, Donovan accepted an offer to coach the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder.  He would leave Florida as far and away the winningest coach in program history. He led the Gators to 14 NCAA tournament appearances, six SEC regular season titles (four outright, two shared) and four SEC Tournament championships\u2013in all three cases, more than all other coaches in program history combined.\n\nMike White era 2015-2022\nOn May 7, 2015, former Louisiana Tech head coach Mike White was hired to coach the Gators, succeeding Billy Donovan.  White played point guard at Ole Miss and later served as an assistant there for seven seasons.  He is a native of the state of Florida and had led Louisiana Tech to three straight conference titles.\nIn his first season at the helm, he led Florida to a 21\u201315 record and a berth in the NIT Tournament, defeating North Florida and Ohio State in the first two rounds before losing to eventual-NIT champion George Washington in the quarterfinal. White's second Gator squad was the best of his tenure, as Florida went 24\u20137, finished 2nd in the SEC standings, and earned a #4 seed in the 2017 NCAA tournament. They reached the Elite Eight on a three-point buzzer beater by guard Chris Chiozza to beat Wisconsin, then were upset one game short of the Final Four by SEC rival South Carolina, 77\u201370.\nFlorida earned invitations to four straight NCAA tournaments and won at least one game in each appearance under White (not counting the 2020 NCAA tournament, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic). However, after 2017, they earned a decreasing number of wins each season, were never a serious contender for SEC championships, and had a 10\u201315 record in games played in March. After a disappointing 2021-22 season in which Florida did not earn a berth in the NCAA tournament, White left to become the head coach at Georgia.\n\nTodd Golden era 2022-present\nRebuilding to a tournament appearance\nOn March 18, 2022, former San Francisco head coach Todd Golden was named Florida's new head basketball coach. Golden's first season ended with the Gators going 16\u201317, with a 9\u20139 SEC record and finishing 8th in conference play. They received an at-large bid to the NIT, but were eliminated by UCF in the first round.\nGolden built on this success towards planning for the 2023\u201324 season, where he invested heavily in the transfer portal, gaining players such as Zyon Pullin, Walter Clayton Jr. and Tyrese Samuel as well as the recruitments of forwards Alex Condon and Thomas Haugh. Much improved from the prior season, a 21\u201310 regular season and 11\u20137 SEC record was good enough to earn the Gators the 6-seed in the SEC tournament, where they defeated Georgia, Alabama, and Texas A&M on their way to the SEC championship before losing to Auburn 86\u201367. This earned the Gators the No. 7 seed in the South Regional in the 2024 NCAA tournament, where they played the No. 10 seed Colorado. A late jump shot by KJ Simpson with 1.7 seconds left saw the Gators fall to the Buffaloes 102\u2013100. Despite a first round exit in the NCAA tournament, the 2023\u201324 season marked a major stepping stone in Florida's return to national prominence.\n\n2024\u201325: Third NCAA national championship season\nWith the return of Walter Clayton Jr. and Will Richard, Florida remained focused on the return to national prominence. This would be improved upon with the gaining of transfers Rueben Chinyelu and most importantly Alijah Martin, who went on a Final Four run with FAU two years prior.\nThe Gators started off ranked No. 21 in the AP Poll and after a 13\u20130 start, the Gators found themselves ranked No. 6 before suffering their first loss to Kentucky to begin SEC play. After losing to Kentucky in their conference opener, they responded by defeating No. 1 Tennessee by 30 points on January 7th and then defeating No. 1 Auburn by 9 points on February 8th, becoming the fifth team in NCAA history to defeat two No. 1 teams in the same season. Florida finished the regular season 27\u20134, with a 14\u20134 record good enough for 2nd place in the SEC. After defeating Missouri and Alabama, Florida defeated Tennessee 86\u201377 to win their first SEC tournament championship since 2014.\n\nLocking in the No. 1 seed in the West Regional, Florida went on to defeat Norfolk State 95\u201369 to set up a match with the two-time defending national champions UConn in the Round of 32. After trailing for most of the game, Clayton Jr.'s 23 points led the Gators past the Huskies 77\u201375. Their comeback victory over UConn proved to be a trend for Florida during the tournament, as they orchestrated three additional comeback wins later in the tournament. Their 87\u201371 win over Maryland in the Sweet Sixteen set up a matchup with Texas Tech in the Elite Eight. Down 9 points with 3:14 left to play, four straight 3-pointers from Clayton Jr. and Haugh helped the Gators defeat the Red Raiders 84\u201379 and secure Florida's first Final Four appearance since 2014. In the Final Four, the Gators defeated Auburn, overcoming a 9-point second-half deficit off of Walter Clayton Jr.'s 34 points. Clayton Jr. became the first player to score 30+ points in both the Elite Eight and Final Four since Larry Bird in 1979. On April 7, 2025, Golden led Florida to its first National Championship since the 2006\u201307 season with a 65\u201363 win over the Houston Cougars. Clayton Jr. was named the Final Four MOP.\n\nHead coaches\nChampionships\nNCAA national championships\nThe Florida Gators have won three NCAA national championships, which is tied for 8th all-time among Division I schools. The Gators won two national championships in 2005\u201306, and 2006\u201307 under Billy Donovan. That was the first time any team had won back-to-back national championships since Duke did it in 1991\u201392. In addition, the Gators became the first school to ever win a national championship in football and basketball in both the same calendar year and the same academic year (the Gators' football team defeated Ohio State in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game).\n\nSEC Tournament championships\nThe Gators have won five SEC Tournament championships, four of which came under Billy Donovan, including three in a row from 2005 to 2007.\n\nSEC Championships\nThough the automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament is given to the conference tournament winner, the SEC declares the team with the best record in the regular season the \"official\" conference champion. The Gators have won a total of seven official (regular season) SEC championships. Norm Sloan won the first one during the 1988\u201389 season, and Billy Donovan has won the other six, including the 2006\u201307 season in which the Gators also won the SEC Tournament championship and NCAA national championship, and three in a four-year span from 2011 to 2014.\nThe 2013\u201314 squad became the first team in SEC history to have an 18\u20130 regular season conference record.\n\nComplete postseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nFlorida has appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times. Their combined record is 49\u201320. However, their appearances in 1987 and 1988 have been vacated by the NCAA making their official record 46\u201318. They were NCAA National Champions in 2006, 2007, and 2025.\n\n* Vacated by the NCAA\n\nNCAA Tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nNIT results\nThe Gators have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 12 times. Their combined record is 14\u201314.\n\nFinal Fours\nThe Florida Gators have been to six Final Fours.\nLon Kruger took the Gators to their first one in 1994. Florida received the No.3 seed in the East Region (played in Miami). The Gators swept through the region with victories over 14th seeded James Madison, 11th seeded Pennsylvania, 2nd seeded Connecticut and punched their ticket to their first ever Final Four by knocking off the upstart, 9th seeded Boston College. But the Gators then lost to Duke in the national semifinals.\nBilly Donovan took them back six years later in 2000, winning the East Region (played in Syracuse, New York) as the No.5 seed. To get to the Final Four, Florida first had to survive a tough test from 12th seeded Butler in the first round in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Trailing 68\u201367 with time running out, the Gators won on a last second shot by Mike Miller. After that initial test, Florida ran through the rest of the region, easily defeating 4th seeded Illinois, top seeded Duke, and 3rd seeded Oklahoma State to reach the Final Four, where they defeated North Carolina in the semifinals, but lost to Michigan State in the national championship game.\nDonovan would get Florida back to the Final Four in 2006, winning the Minneapolis Regional as the No.3 seed with victories over 14th seeded South Alabama, 11th seeded UW-Milwaukee, 7th seeded Georgetown and top seeded Villanova in the Regional Final. The Gators proceeded to knock off upstart George Mason (who won the Washington, D.C. Regional as the No.11 seed) in the semifinals and then handily defeated UCLA in the championship game for their first ever national championship.\nThe next year, Donovan's Gators would make it not only back to back Final Fours, but back to back national championships as well. They received the top seed in the St. Louis Regional, and defeated 16th seeded Jackson State, 9th seeded Purdue, 5th seeded Butler and 3rd seeded Oregon in the Regional Final to earn a trip to their 4th Final Four. There, they dispatched UCLA in the semifinals and then Ohio State in the title game.\nOver the next decade, Florida reached the doorstep of the Final Four several times but was usually turned away. From 2011 to 2014, the Gators made four consecutive trips to the Elite Eight. Florida held late leads in the first two of them, but lost both times, first to Butler in overtime, and then the following year, blew a 65\u201354 lead with eight minutes to go and fell to Louisville. In 2013, Florida made its third straight trip to the Elite 8, but this time got blown out by Michigan. Florida finally broke through against Dayton in their fourth straight Regional final appearance and moved on to play eventual 2014 national champions Connecticut in the Final Four, where they were defeated 63\u201353. After a two-year absence from the NCAA Tournament, Mike White got them back to the Elite Eight in 2017, where the Gators built a halftime lead but were again defeated, this time by SEC rival South Carolina.\nFlorida then regressed under White and plateaued, never even reaching a Sweet 16 again under his leadership. White then departed for rival Georgia and was replaced by Todd Golden, who promptly rebuilt the program back to the levels of success enjoyed under Donovan. In his third season in Gainesville, Golden\u2019s Gators rode the momentum they\u2019d built from an SEC Tournament Championship to reach the program\u2019s sixth Final Four. Along the way, Florida defeated 16th seeded Norfolk State in the Round of 64, avenged the 2014 Final Four loss to 8th seeded UConn with a thrilling 77\u201375 win in the Round of 32, overcame a rough start to blow out 4th seeded Maryland in the Sweet 16, and punched its ticket to the Final Four with a historic comeback against 3rd seeded Texas Tech in the Elite 8. Playing in San Francisco \u2013 the city in which Golden got his first head coaching job \u2013 the Gators erased a 75\u201366 deficit with 2:55 to go and stormed back to pull off a stunning 84\u201379 victory over the Red Raiders. The following weekend at the Final Four in San Antonio, Florida would erase a pair of daunting second-half deficits to cap their storybook run, roaring back from 49-40 down to beat Auburn 79-73 in the semifinal and then climbing out of a 42-30 hole in the finals to against Houston, defeating the Cougars 65-63 for the Gators' third national championship.\n\nHome courts\nPlayers of note\nAll-Americans\nFlorida Gators basketball players who have been recognized as All-Americans include:\n\nNeal Walk, center; AP Second Team; NABC Third Team; UPI Third Team (1968)\nNeal Walk, center; AP Third Team; NABC; UPI Third Team (1969)\nUdonis Haslem, center; AP Third Team (2001)\nAl Horford, forward-center; AP Third Team; NABC Second Team (2007)\nJoakim Noah, forward-center; AP Consensus Second Team; NABC Second Team; USBWA Second Team (2007)\nScottie Wilbekin, point guard; AP Third Team; NABC Third Team; Sporting News Third Team (2014)\nWalter Clayton Jr., point guard; Consensus First Team (2025)\n\nSEC Player of the Year\nTwo Florida Gators have been recognized as the SEC Player of the Year:\n\nChandler Parsons, small forward (2011)\nScottie Wilbekin, point guard (2014)\n\nRetired numbers\nFlorida has retired one jersey number.\n\nCurrent professional players\nIn the NBA\nBradley Beal (2011\u201312 at UF), Phoenix Suns\nDorian Finney-Smith (2013\u201316 at UF), Los Angeles Lakers\nAl Horford (2004\u201307 at UF), Boston Celtics\nTre Mann (2019\u201321 at UF), Charlotte Hornets\nAndrew Nembhard (2018\u201320 at UF), Indiana Pacers\nZyon Pullin (2023\u201324 at UF), Memphis Grizzlies\n\nOverseas players\nKerry Blackshear Jr. (2019\u20132020 at UF), player in the Israeli Basketball Premier League\nNick Calathes (2007\u20132009 at UF), Greek-American player for AS Monaco Basket in the EuroLeague\nChris Chiozza (2014\u20132018 at UF), player in Turkish Basketbol S\u00fcper Ligi\nAnthony Duruji (2020\u20132022 at UF), player for Saint-Chamond Basket of LNB Pro B in France\nJohn Egbunu (2015\u20132017 at UF), Nigerian-born American player for Hapoel Jerusalem of the Israeli Basketball Premier League\nMichael Frazier II (2012\u20132015 at UF), player in Jordanian Premier Basketball League\nKevarrius Hayes (2015\u20132019 at UF), player for Paris Basketball of LNB Pro A and the EuroLeague\nEgor Koulechov (2017\u20132018 at UF), Israeli-Russian player for Israeli team Ironi Nahariya\nKyle Lofton (2022\u20132023 at UF), player for Bamberg Baskets of the German Basketball Bundesliga\nCasey Prather (2010\u20132014 at UF), player in the Israeli Basketball Premier League\nDevin Robinson (2014\u20132017 at UF), player for Cedevita Olimpija of the Slovenian Basketball League and ABA League\nAlex Tyus (2007\u20132011 at UF), American-Israeli player, also plays for the Israeli national basketball team\nScottie Wilbekin (2010\u20132014 at UF), Turkish-American player in the Israeli Basketball Premier League\nWill Yeguete (2010\u20132014 at UF), French player for Le Mans Sarthe Basket in LNB Pro A\n\nSee also\nFlorida Gators\nFlorida Gators Dazzlers\nFlorida Gators women's basketball\nFlorida\u2013Kentucky men's basketball rivalry\nHistory of the University of Florida\nList of Florida Gators in the NBA\nList of University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame members\nUniversity Athletic Association\nFlorida-Florida State men's basketball rivalry\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nDortch, Chris, String Music: Inside the Rise of SEC Basketball, Brassey's, Inc., Dulles, Virginia (2002).

    "summary": "The Florida Gators men's basketball team represents the University of Florida in the sport of basketball.  The Gators compete in NCAA Division I's Southeastern Conference (SEC). Home games are played on Billy Donovan Court in the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center on the university's Gainesville campus.\nWhile the University of Florida's men's basketball team first took the court in 1915, the program did not receive much support from the university for several decades. The basketball team did not have a permanent home court with adequate seating capacity until the Florida Gymnasium opened in 1949, and did not hire a full-time basketball coach until Norm Sloan in 1960, and did not play in a modern arena until the O'Connell Center opened in 1980. Early highlights included the program's first postseason appearance in the 1969 National Invitation Tournament with the Gators' first All-American Neal Walk, a run to the Sweet Sixteen during its first NCAA tournament appearance in 1987 under head coach Norm Sloan, and another surprise tournament run to the 1994 Final Four under head coach Lon Kruger. However, consistent success was elusive, and the Gators often found themselves in the bottom half of the SEC basketball standings.\nThe trajectory of Florida's basketball program changed with the hiring of head coach Billy Donovan in 1996. After having made five NCAA Tournament appearances and having won only two regular season SEC championship and zero SEC tournaments in 78 seasons of basketball before his arrival, the Gators won six SEC regular season championships and four SEC tournament championships, appeared in 14 NCAA Tournaments, reached four Final Fours, and won back-to-back national championships (2006 and 2007) during Donovan's 19 seasons in Gainesville before he left to coach in the NBA in 2015. Under Donovan, Florida's successes were notable as a school with a popular and dominant football team, as they remain the only school to have won the national championship in both sports in the same year (2007).\nTodd Golden became the Gators' head basketball coach in March 2022. After struggling in his first season, Golden was able to establish stability within the program, returning to the NCAA tournament in 2024. In 2025, Todd Golden led the Gators to a 36\u20134 record, SEC Tournament championship, and the program's third national championship.",

    "biography": "The Florida State Seminoles men's basketball team represents Florida State University (variously Florida State or FSU) in the intercollegiate sport of basketball. The Seminoles compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\nThough they have historically played under the shadow of the football program, the Seminoles have had successes on the hardwood. Florida State has made eighteen NCAA tournament appearances: advancing to the Round of 32 on twelve occasions, the Sweet Sixteen on seven occasions, the Elite Eight on three occasions, and the Final Four once, moving on to the championship game and finishing as runner-up. In 2020, despite holding final rankings of #4 in the AP Poll and #5 in the Coaches' Poll, Florida State was declared the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Champions by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida State Legislature after the  2020 NCAA Tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This declaration holds no merit with the NCAA, but it is the only claim the basketball program has to a national title. Florida State has also made ten appearances in the National Invitation Tournament.\nIn the 78 season history of the Seminole basketball program, the Seminoles have won the regular season conference title five times and the conference tournament title four times, including two ACC championships.\nFlorida State has had 23 All-Americans, 26 players inducted into the Hall of Fame, and 37 players that went on to play in the NBA. Jeff Sagarin and ESPN listed the program 74th in the college basketball all-time rankings in the 'ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia'.\nThe Seminoles play their home games in the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center in downtown Tallahassee, Florida campus.  The current head men's basketball coach is alumnus Luke Loucks.\n\nOverview\nThe Florida State Seminoles men's team annually plays an eighteen-game conference schedule that is preceded by an out-of-conference schedule against few annual opponents except for Florida. Their conference schedule consists of a home-and-home game against two permanent rivals (Miami and Clemson), alternating home-and-home games against the other seventeen ACC teams.\n\nHistory\nFlorida State University has officially fielded a basketball team since 1947.\n\nDon Loucks era (1947\u20131948)\nHugh Donald Loucks served as the first basketball coach for the Florida State Seminoles. He coached at the school for one year and compiled an overall record of 5\u201313, becoming one of only two coaches to leave the program with a losing record of 11 games.\n\nJ.K. Kennedy era (1949\u20131966)\nAfter the departure of Loucks, J.K. Kennedy became the coach. He was the first coach to find success at Florida State, holding the position for 18 years and compiling a record of 234\u2013208.\n\nHugh Durham era (1966\u20131978)\nHugh Durham played at Florida State in the 1950s, scoring 1,381 points in three years. His average of 21.9 points per game in 1958\u201359 is the seventh best tally in Florida State history. Durham's career average of 18.9 points per game is still the ninth best in school history. After his playing career had ended, he began his coaching career as an assistant coach in 1959. Seven years later, Durham would be named head coach in 1966. One of the top players during this time was future NBA Hall-of-Famer Dave Cowens. Durham led the Seminoles from 1966 to 1978. In 1972, Durham led Florida State to a runner-up finish in the NCAA Tournament. A hard-fought 81\u201376 loss to the top-ranked UCLA Bruins in the NCAA Championship game prevented Durham's Florida State team from winning the NCAA tournament. Another key player for the Seminoles was Harry Davis, who helped the program sustain stability.\nDurham's overall record at Florida State was a 230\u201395 record with three NCAA tournament bids. He still owns the highest winning percentage of any Florida State coach at .708. Durham is the only coach in NCAA history to be the all-time winningest coach (percentage or wins) at three different Division I schools.\n\nJoe Williams era (1978\u20131986)\nAfter the departure of Hugh Durham, Joe Williams took over the Seminole basketball program. One of the standout players during this period was George McCloud. McCloud helped the Seminoles rebuild after the departure of Durham by becoming one of the most prolific scorers in FSU history. During his senior season, McCloud had the second-highest scoring average and the sixth-highest in Florida State history. Joe Williams would coach his final season in 1986.\n\nPat Kennedy era (1986\u20131997)\nThe 1992\u20131993 season would see the emergence of one of the Seminoles' best players in its history, Bob Sura. Not much was expected of the Seminoles in 1992 as they entered into their first season in the ACC, yet they finished second in the conference to national champion Duke. The team repeated the second-place finish in 1993, establishing itself as a legitimate national power. In the 1993 NCAA Tournament they fell to Kentucky in the Elite Eight round.  In Kennedy's final season (1996\u20131997) he led the team to the NIT Final, losing to the Michigan Wolverines.\n\nSteve Robinson era (1997\u20132002)\nSteve Robinson took over the program for the 1997\u20131998 season and led the Seminoles to the NCAA Tournament his first year.  However, the team suffered losing records the next four seasons and Robinson left the program after the 2001\u20132002 campaign.  Robinson is now an assistant coach with the Arizona Wildcats.\n\nLeonard Hamilton era (2002\u20132025)\nLeonard Hamilton became Florida State's seventh head basketball coach on March 19, 2002. In two years, Tim Pickett scored 1,039 points, earning him First-Team All-ACC and All-American Honorable Mention honors. Hamilton was named ACC Coach of the Year in 2009, 2012, and 2020. Hamilton is also the first Seminole coach to win an ACC Championship, capturing the league tournament title in 2012 and the regular season title in 2020. He led the Seminoles to eight NCAA tournament appearances. During his tenure, Florida State was the third-most successful team in the conference. Hamilton is the winningest coach in the program's history, the fifth winningest coach in conference history, and sent twenty players to the NBA draft, including nine first round picks. Hamilton made the decision to retire in 2025 following the conclusion of the season, after serving as head coach for twenty-three seasons. In his final home game as head coach, Hamilton won his 200th regular-season ACC game, becoming just the fourth coach in the history of the conference to do so.\n\nLuke Loucks era (2025\u2013present)\nOn March 9, 2025, Sacramento Kings assistant coach Luke Loucks was announced as the team's new head coach following Leonard Hamilton's retirement. Loucks played for the Seminoles under Hamilton from 2008\u20132012, reaching the NCAA Tournament each season, and was a member of the 2012 ACC Tournament championship team.\n\nCurrent coaching staff\nOther staff\nPerin Foote - Director of Operations\nRyan Shnider - Assistant Director of Basketball Operations\nChris Kent - Director of Player Development\nKyle Washington - Director of Video and Scouting\nJustin Lindner - Assistant Director of Player Development and Scouting\nTerance Mann - Assistant General Manager\nKelly Nielsen - Chief of Staff\n\nHome court\nDonald L. Tucker Center\nThe Seminoles play all of their home games at the Donald L. Tucker Center. It is a 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) multi-purpose facility which has hosted over 25 years worth of Seminole games. Since the 2016\u20132017 season, the Seminoles have gone undefeated twice at home and had twenty-five consecutive conference victories on their home court, the second longest streak in conference history.\n\nChampionships\nNational Championship appearance\nFlorida State has appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament's National Championship game once, in 1972.

  "Georgetown Hoyas": {
    "biography": "The Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball program represents Georgetown University in NCAA Division I men's intercollegiate basketball and the Big East Conference. Georgetown has competed in men's college basketball since 1907. The current head coach of the program is Ed Cooley.\nGeorgetown won the national championship in 1984 and has made the Final Four on five occasions. They have won the Big East Conference tournament a record eight times, and have also won or shared the Big East regular season title ten times. They have appeared in the NCAA tournament 31 times and in the National Invitation Tournament 13 times.\nThe Hoyas historically have been well regarded not only for their team success, but also for generating players that have succeeded both on and off the court, producing NBA legends such as Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning, and Allen Iverson, as well as United States Congressman Henry Hyde and former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Seven former Hoya players or coaches are members of the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1907\u20131943)\nFounded in the fall of 1906, the Georgetown men's basketball team played its first game on February 9, 1907, defeating the University of Virginia by a score of 22\u201311. In its first 60-some years, the program displayed only sporadic success. Until McDonough Gymnasium opened on campus for the 1950\u201351 season, the team changed home courts frequently, playing on campus at Ryan Gymnasium and off campus at McKinley Technology High School, Uline Arena, and the National Guard Armory, as well as playing individual home games at the University of Maryland's Ritchie Coliseum and The Catholic University of America's Brookland Gymnasium, among others. The downtown locations of these venues was also influenced by the number of Law School students who played on the team in this era. From 1918 through 1923, while on campus at Ryan Gymnasium, Georgetown managed a 52\u20130 home record under coach John O'Reilly. A large on-campus arena was proposed in 1927, but it was shelved during the Great Depression.\n\nThe team recruited its first All-American, Ed Hargaden, in 1931. From 1932 until 1939, the Hoyas played in the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference, and they were regular-season conference co-champions in 1939. In 1942, a Hoya went pro for the first time, when three seniors, Al Lujack, Buddy O'Grady, and Dino Martin, were drafted professionally upon graduation.\nThe next year the team, led by future congressman Henry Hyde, reached new heights and posted its first 20-win season ever, going 22\u20135 on the year. This success translated into a berth into the 1943 NCAA tournament, the school's first postseason appearance. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the Hoyas made it all the way to the National Championship game, where they ultimately lost to Wyoming. Georgetown's coach of this squad, Elmer Ripley, was later inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1973.\n\nWorld War II and the lean years (1943\u20131972)\nComing off of the best season in school history, momentum was stalled as the program was suspended from 1943 to 1945 because of World War II. Following the hiatus the program struggled to find its footing, and it was rarely successful over the next three decades, only making two postseason appearances during this time period.\nIn 1953, former Baltimore Bullets player Buddy Jeannette coached the team to its first National Invitation Tournament invitation, but the team lost in the first round to Louisville. Top players from this period include Tom O'Keefe, the first Hoya to reach 1,000 career points in 1949\u201350, and future National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who graduated second in Hoya career rebounds in 1962. O'Keefe returned to coach the team from 1960 until 1966. In 1966 the school hired John \"Jack\" Magee, who had led Boston College as a player to its first NCAA Tournament bid. Magee had some relative success early on, having several winning seasons behind Guard Jim Barry, Forward Richard Manewal and Center Paul Favorite that were capped off with an invite to the 1970 NIT, just its third post-season appearance ever. However, the team lost to LSU in the first round. A losing season the subsequent year, followed up with a three-win season in 1971\u201372, the worst in school history, ultimately led to his dismissal. This was the last time a Hoyas head coach suffered back-to-back losing seasons for over 35 years.\n\nJohn Thompson era (1972\u20131999)\nJohn Thompson Jr., played two seasons with the Boston Celtics before he achieved local notability coaching St. Anthony's High School in Washington, D.C. to several very successful seasons. Thompson was hired to coach Georgetown in 1972, and with recruits from St. Anthony's like Merlin Wilson, quickly and dramatically improved the team. Georgetown, while still independent, participated in the Eastern College Athletic Conference\u2032s 1975 postseason ECAC South tournament, and after a 16\u20139 regular season found itself facing West Virginia in the conference tournament championship. Derrick Jackson's buzzer beater won Georgetown its first tournament championship, and a bid to the 1975 NCAA tournament. Georgetown repeated as ECAC South tournament champions the following year, beating George Washington University when Craig Esherick's buzzer beater sent the game to overtime, and as ECAC South-Upstate Tournament champions in the 1978-79 season, beating Syracuse University in Jim Boeheim's first game against the Hoyas as Syracuse's coach.\n\n1979-80 Season\nPrior to the 1979\u201380 season, Georgetown joined with six other schools, Providence, St. John's, Syracuse, Seton Hall, Connecticut, and Boston College to found a conference focused primarily on basketball. The Big East Conference provided Georgetown increased competition, and several of its longest rivalries. \nOn February 13, 1980, in the final game at Manley Field House, Georgetown star Sleepy Floyd scored two last-second free-throws to snap No. 3 Syracuse's 57 game home winning streak, leading Coach Thompson to declare \"Manley Field House is officially closed.\" They faced Syracuse again three weeks later in the first Big East tournament finals, winning 87\u201381. In the 1980 NCAA tournament, the team advanced to the Elite Eight, where they fell to the Iowa Hawkeyes on a last second foul call.\n\n1981-82 Season\nThe team moved its home arena in the 1981-82 season to the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, to accommodate its growing fan base. It also marked the arrival of heralded recruit, Patrick Ewing, who became one of the first college players to start and star on a varsity team as a freshman. That year, Ewing led the Hoyas to their second Big East tournament title in school history, and a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. \nIn the tournament, the Hoyas advanced to their first Final Four since 1943, where they defeated the University of Louisville 50\u201346, to set up a showdown in the NCAA Final against the University of North Carolina. In one of the most star-studded championship games in NCAA history, Ewing was called for goaltending five times in the first half (later revealed to be intentional at the behest of coach Thompson), setting the tone for the Hoyas and making his presence felt. The Hoyas led by one point late in the game, but a jumpshot by future NBA superstar Michael Jordan gave North Carolina the lead. Georgetown still had a chance at winning the game in the final seconds, but Freddy Brown mistakenly threw a bad pass directly to opposing player James Worthy, and North Carolina won 63\u201362.\n\n1982-83 Season\nFor the 1982-83 season, Georgetown began the season as the No. 2 ranked team in the country. The early season included a highly anticipated matchup with No. 1 Virginia, and highly regarded center Ralph Sampson. Arenas nationwide jockeyed to host the matchup but Georgetown insisted on hosting it at the Capital Centre. WTBS won the rights to broadcast the game with a $550,000 bid, and it was billed as the \"Game of the Decade\".  It became the first major college sports event telecasted exclusively on cable television. In the game, held on December 11, 1982, Virginia's veteran team won, 68\u201363. \nThe Hoyas went on to post a 22\u201310 record for the season and made another NCAA Tournament appearance, but were defeated in the second round of the tournament by Memphis State. This was the only season in Ewing's four-year Georgetown career where the team did not make it as least as far as the National Championship game.\n\n1983-84 Season: National Champions\nIn the 1983-84 season Georgetown again won the Big East conference regular season title, and faced Syracuse for the Big East tournament championship. In a physical and tightly contested contest, Georgetown won 82\u201371 in overtime, securing their third tournament title in the first five years of the newly formed conference. \nIn the NCAA tournament, the No. 1 seeded Hoyas ultimately advanced to the Final Four for the third time in school history to face Kentucky, a team which had never lost a national semifinal game and was led by the \"Twin Towers,\" Sam Bowie and Melvin Turpin. Georgetown was able to turn an early 12 point deficit into a 53\u201340 win to advance to the National Championship game. In the final, the Hoyas faced the University of Houston and future Hall of Fame center Hakeem Olajuwon, who were making their second straight National Championship game appearance. Georgetown led comfortably throughout the final, and went on to an 84\u201375 victory, giving the school its first NCAA Championship. Ewing was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, while Thompson became the first African-American coach to win an NCAA Division I title. Freddy Brown, who made the key turnover in the title game two years prior, was given the chance to raise the trophy first.\n\n1984-85 Season\nTo begin the 1984-85 season, the defending champions opened the season as the No. 1 ranked team and won their first 18 games. On January 26, 1985, St. John's University snapped the Hoyas' 29 game win streak (dating back to the prior season), in what was the first of an unprecedented four contests this season. Their next meeting on February 27, 1985, was one of the most anticipated games in college basketball history, with Georgetown and St. John's ranked No. 2 and No. 1 respectively. Coach Thompson entered Madison Square Garden wearing a shirt under his blazer in the same sweater pattern as St. John's coach Lou Carnesecca, and as a result the game became known as \"the sweater game.\"  The Hoyas easily won the game 85\u201369, and then defeated the Redmen again just a few weeks later in the 1985 Big East tournament finals, capturing their fourth title in six years. The teams met one more time, after both advanced to the Final Four in the NCAA tournament. Again No. 1 Georgetown was victorious, easily handling St. John's 77\u201359. \nIn the title game the Hoyas found themselves matched up with another conference rival in Villanova, whom they had beaten twice that season. An overwhelming favorite going into the game, Georgetown was upset by the Wildcats 66\u201364, who shot a record 78.6 percent (22 of 28) from the floor, denying Georgetown back-to-back titles. Ewing graduated, having helped his team to a 121\u201323 record in his four years, and was the first player in school history to be drafted with the first overall pick.\n\nContinued Success Under Coach Thompson\nFollowing the enormous heights of Ewing's four-year run, the program continued its success in the years that followed. Senior Reggie Williams led the Hoyas to both Big East regular season and tournament championships in the 1986\u201387 season. Freshman Alonzo Mourning and sophomore Dikembe Mutombo helped win both titles in the 1988\u201389 season. Mourning and Mutombo were both excellent shot blockers; Mourning led the nation in 1988\u201389, and fans created a \"Rejection Row\" section under the basket. They repeated both championships in the 1989\u201390 season and won the regular season title in the 1991-92 season.\nIn the 1994\u201395 season, newcomer Allen Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award. During his two years at Georgetown, Iverson scored a Georgetown-record 22.9 points per game. In 1995\u201396, he propelled the Hoyas to a major upset over the Connecticut Huskies during the season, but Georgetown later lost to the Huskies in the final seconds of that year's Big East tournament. In the NCAA tournament, the Hoyas came up one game short of the Final Four, losing to the University of Massachusetts, the top ranked team in the country.\nIn the 1996\u201397 season, with an 11\u20137 conference record, the Hoyas won the regular season Big East 7 Division title for the second year in a row, but fell in the first round of the 1997 NCAA tournament. In December 1997, just after the beginning of the 1997-98 season, the team moved back into Washington, D.C., with the construction of a new arena, the Verizon Center (originally MCI Center), in Chinatown. The 1997-98 campaign ended in an overtime loss to Georgia Tech in the NIT.\nThompson retired abruptly in the midst of the 1998\u201399 season on January 8, 1999, citing marital problems, and was replaced by his assistant Craig Esherick. Under Thompson, 26 players were chosen in the NBA draft, eight in the first round, including two players selected first overall; Ewing by the New York Knicks in 1985 and Iverson by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1996. Over his 26+1\u20442 seasons, Thompson's Hoyas went an impressive 596\u2013239 (.714), running off a streak of 24 postseason appearances with 20 in the NCAA tournament and four in the NIT. He was honored as the National Coach of the Year three times during his career at Georgetown, and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nCraig Esherick era (1999\u20132004)\nCraig Esherick coached the Georgetown Hoyas basketball squad from January 1999 to March 2004. Esherick was a four-year player for the men's basketball team from 1974 to 1978 and then the lead assistant coach under John Thompson Jr. from 1981 to 1999. The team finished with a 15\u201315 record in his first season \u2013 going 8\u201310 after Thompson resigned and Esherick took over \u2013before losing to Princeton in the first round of the 1999 NIT. They improved in 1999-2000, going 19\u201315 and accepting an invitation to the 2000 NIT. After winning the first-round game in triple overtime over Virginia, the Hoyas lost in the second-round game to California.\n\n2000-01 Season\nIn 2000\u201301, led by future top NBA Draft pick Michael Sweetney, they made the NCAA tournament after finishing 23\u20137 in the regular season. In the opening round of the NCAA tournament the 7th-seeded Hoyas advanced past 10th-seeded Arkansas on a game-winning shot at the buzzer by Nat Burton. The Hoyas subsequently beat Hampton, and then lost to third-seeded Maryland in the Sweet Sixteen.\n\nEsherick's Final Years\nIn 2001\u201302, the Hoyas went 19\u201311, barely missing an NCAA tournament bid. The team rejected a bid to the 2002 NIT bid because of travel-arrangement issues associated with the players' ability to attend classes, resulting in their first season without a postseason tournament since 1973-74. In 2002-03, the Hoyas finished the regular season with a 19\u201315 record, and accepted a bid to the 2003 NIT, where they made it to the final but lost to Big East rival St. John's. Sweetney was named a second-team All-American and was drafted with the ninth pick in the 2002 NBA draft by the New York Knicks.\nIn Esherick's final season, 2003\u201304, the Hoyas struggled to a 13\u201315 overall record and a dismal 4\u201312 Big East record, and for the first time since the 1973\u201374 season received no invitation to either the NCAA tournament or the NIT. The 13 wins were the team's fewest since the 1973\u201374 season and Esherick was fired after 5+1\u20442 seasons as head coach on March 15, 2004, five days after an opening-round loss in the Big East tournament to Boston College. He had posted a 103\u201374 (.597) record during his tenure as head coach. Georgetown began a national search for a new coach after Esherick's firing that resulted in the hiring of John Thompson III.\n\nJohn Thompson era (2004\u20132017)\nOn April 21, 2004, John Thompson III was selected as the head coach of the Hoyas. The son of the legendary Hoyas coach took over the position after over a decade at Princeton University. The younger Thompson was a player for the Tigers from 1984 to 1988, was an assistant coach at Princeton from 1995 to 2000, and then took over as head coach at Princeton until his move to the Hoyas. Thompson's head coaching stint at Princeton was marked with success as he led the Tigers to three Ivy League titles, two NCAA Tournament appearances and one NIT appearance.\nThompson brought with him an adaptation of the Princeton offense as an offensive philosophy to Georgetown. He had learned it under the tutelage of legendary coach Pete Carril at Princeton and began to adjust the strategy to the more athletic players he would be coaching at Georgetown. Thompson III also immediately brought two new assistant coaches to Georgetown in Robert Burke and Kevin Broadus.\nThompson inherited four players that Esherick had recruited: Jeff Green, Roy Hibbert, Tyler Crawford and RaMell Ross. He also brought with him a former Princeton recruit, Jonathan Wallace and saw the return of two major contributors from the previous Georgetown team in Brandon Bowman, Ashanti Cook, and Darrel Owens. John Thompson III's first notable win with the team took place on January 21, 2006, in the 16th game of the 2005\u201306 season, when unranked Georgetown upset No. 1 Duke. This was Georgetown's first win over a No. 1 ranked team in 21 years.\n\n2006-07 Season\nThe 2006\u201307 season marked the centennial of Hoya hoops, which was celebrated by honoring some of the team's most famous alumni at the Georgetown-Marquette game on February 10, 2007. Led by juniors Green, Hibbert, Wallace, Patrick Ewing Jr., the son of the Georgetown player from the elder Thompson era, the Hoyas won their first regular-season Big East Championship since 1992 and defeated Pittsburgh to win their first Big East tournament championship since 1989. Jeff Green was named the Big East Player of the Year and the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. In the NCAA tournament, the Hoyas beat North Carolina in the Regional Final when their defense caused North Carolina to suffer an improbable collapse in which UNC missed 22 of their final 23 field goal attempts. The Hoyas then advanced to the Final Four where they fell to an Ohio State team led by Greg Oden.\n\n2007-08 Season\nThe 2007\u201308 Hoyas finished with a regular season record of 27\u20135, and again won the conference regular season title. They lost to Pittsburgh in the Big East tournament championship game. They received a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they lost their second-round game. After the season, Roy Hibbert, Jonathan Wallace, and Patrick Ewing Jr. all graduated, while Vernon Macklin and Jeremiah Rivers both transferred from the school.\n\n2008-09 Season\nThe Hoyas began their 2008\u201309 season ranked No. 22 AP/No. 18 Coaches, however, college basketball's toughest strength of schedule eventually wore down a team that was also one of the youngest. The Hoyas were 7\u201311 in Big East play for a 12th-place finish, followed by a first-round loss in the Big East tournament. The Hoyas accepted a bid to the NIT, but lost in the first round to Baylor.\n\n2009-10 Season\nIn 2009\u201310, the team finished the season 23\u201311, and 10\u20138 in Big East play. They advanced to the championship game of the Big East tournament before losing to West Virginia. They received an at\u2013large bid to the NCAA tournament, earning a No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region, where they were upset by No. 14 seed Ohio in the first round. Standout center Greg Monroe entered the NBA draft as a sophomore and was selected by the Detroit Pistons.\n\n2010-11 Season\nThe 2010\u201311 team was led by Austin Freeman and Chris Wright. The team scored multiple early wins over ranked teams, including an overtime win at No. 9 Missouri, but their stumbles at the end of the season coincided with Wright breaking his hand and missing three games. The team received an at-large bid as a No. 6 seed, but lost in their first game of the NCAA tournament to No. 11-seeded and eventual Final Four participant VCU.\n\n2011-12 Season\nPrior to the 2011\u201312 season, the Hoyas made a goodwill trip to China for several matches with local teams. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden attended their first game, a win over the Shanxi Zhongyu Brave Dragons. Their second game against the Bayi Rockets, however, ended in a brawl, causing the team to leave the court while Chinese fans threw garbage and debris. Georgetown won its final games, against the Liaoning Dinosaurs and the Taiwanese national team without incident. The Hoyas finished the season in fourth place in the Big East and received a bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 3 seed in the Midwest. After a win in the second round, they were upset by No. 11-seeded NC State.\n\n2012-13 Season\nThe 2012\u201313 season saw the Hoyas as the top overall seed in the Big East tournament based on a tiebreaker, but lost in the semifinals. Georgetown received a bid as a No. 2 seed in the South bracket in the NCAA tournament, facing tournament newcomer Florida Gulf Coast University in the second round. Georgetown lost to the 15th-seeded Eagles 78\u201368, the seventh number two seed to lose to a 15 seed. It was the fourth consecutive season the Hoyas were eliminated by a double-digit seed in the NCAA tournament.\n\n2013-14 Season\nThe 2013\u201314 season was the team's first after Georgetown and six other schools left the original Big East Conference and joined Butler, Creighton, and Xavier in forming the new Big East Conference \u2013 part of a major conference realignment in which several other teams moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference from the old Big East and the old Big East became the American Athletic Conference. \nLike the previous year, the 2013\u201314 season started abroad, with the Hoyas playing in the Armed Forces Classic at Camp Humphreys near Pyeongtaek, South Korea. After a 17\u201313 regular-season record followed by an upset in the first round of the Big East tournament at the hands of last-place DePaul, the team received a No. 4 seed in the NIT, losing in the second round to top-seeded Florida State.\n\nJohn Thompson III's Final Years\nIn 2014\u201315, the Hoyas rebounded from their previous season's performance. Ranked as high as No. 21 at times, they completed the regular season with a 20\u20137 record and a second-place finish in the Big East, and advanced to the semifinals of the Big East tournament before losing to Xavier. Ranked No. 22 in the country, they received a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament, but lost to Utah in the third round.\nThe Hoyas under Thompson III struggled for the next two years. They began their 2015\u201316 season with a four-game exhibition trip to Italy and Switzerland, and early in the regular season defeated No. 14 Syracuse, but then staggered to a 15\u201318 finish. They failed to receive an invitation to either the NCAA tournament or the NIT for the first time since 2004 and only the second time since 1974.\nDuring the 2016\u201317 season, Georgetown defeated three ranked teams\u2014No. 13 Oregon, No. 16 Creighton, and No. 11 Butler\u2014as well as their former Big East rivals Syracuse and Connecticut, but they finished ninth in the Big East with a 5\u201313 conference record\u2014the most losses they had ever suffered in a season in either version of the Big East Conference\u2014and lost to St. John's in the first round of the 2017 Big East tournament to finish 14\u201318. They missed both the NCAA tournament and the NIT for the second straight year, the first time they had missed the postseason in back-to-back seasons since 1974. \nThompson became the first Georgetown head coach to preside over consecutive losing seasons since John \"Jack\" Magee in 1970\u201371 and 1971\u201372. On March 23, 2017, Georgetown officials announced that Thompson had been fired.\n\nPatrick Ewing era (2017\u20132023)\nOn April 3, 2017, Georgetown University announced that it had hired Patrick Ewing, the school's most decorated player, as its head coach. In his four years as a player at Georgetown, Ewing led the Hoyas to three Big East championships, three Final Fours, and the 1984 National Championship. Prior to taking over as the program's head coach, Ewing had spent the previous thirteen years as an assistant coach in the NBA, working for four different franchises under the tutelage of coaches such as Jeff Van Gundy, Stan Van Gundy, and Steve Clifford.\n\n2017-18 Season\nIn 2017\u201318, Georgetown finished with a 15\u201315 record and 5\u201313 in the Big East. The Hoyas won the first eight games of Ewing's tenure and finished their non-conference schedule with a 10\u20131 record, but struggled in conference play. The season ended with a 88\u201377 loss to St. John's in the first round of the Big East tournament. The team did not participate in any postseason tournament.\n\n2018-19 Season\nIn Ewing's second season, the 2018\u201319 team finished 19\u201312 and 9\u20139 in the Big East, in a four-way tie for third place in the conference, their highest finish since 2015. At the conclusion of the conference schedule, Jesse Govan was named First Team All-Big East, James Akinjo was named Big East Freshman of the Year, and Mac McClung and Josh LeBlanc were named to the All-Big East Freshman Team. The Hoyas lost their first game in the 2019 Big East tournament to Seton Hall 73\u201357. They were selected to play in the 2019 NIT, their first postseason appearance since 2015, but dropped their first-round game 71\u201368 to Harvard.\n\n2019-20 Season\nThe following season the 2019\u201320 Hoyas finished 15\u201317 and 5\u201313 in the Big East. In November, the team participated in the Empire Classic at Madison Square Garden in New York City where they beat No. 22 Texas 82\u201366 and moved to the final to face No. 1 Duke. Despite having a double-digit lead in the first half vs Duke, the Hoyas ultimately fell 81\u201373. Playing with only 9 scholarship players following several defections and injuries, the Hoyas lost their final 7 games, including a 75\u201362 loss in the opening round of the 2020 Big East tournament to St. John's. All postseason tournaments were subsequently cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2020-21 Season\nThe 2020\u201321 Hoyas finished the season 10\u201313 and 7\u20139 in the Big East. Before the season started, leading scorer Mac McClung announced his decision to transfer to Texas Tech. Because of COVID-19 protocols, the team played all of its home games on campus at McDonough Arena without fans. After a 74\u201369 loss at Syracuse, the team went on a 21-day pause due to COVID-19 protocols. After the hiatus, the team returned to win six of its next ten games. The Hoyas' 7\u20139 record resulted in an eighth-place finish in the conference. At the 2021 Big East tournament, the team won its first tournament game under Ewing, with a 68\u201349 victory over Marquette in the opening round, then followed that up with wins against top-seeded Villanova and Seton Hall, sending them to the title game where they defeated Creighton 73\u201348 for their first title since 2007, and the eighth in school history, extending their own conference record. The Hoyas earned a 12 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they lost their opening round game to Colorado 96\u201373.\n\nEwing's Final Years as Coach: Historic Struggles\nThe following season, the Hoyas were unable to build off their unlikely March run the prior season and suffered their worst season in school history. Georgetown lost all 19 conference games they played in 2021-22. They also set a school record for most losses in a season with 25, finishing the year at 6\u201325. The season ended with a 57\u201353 loss in the 2022 Big East tournament to Seton Hall. Despite some rumblings about his job security, Ewing was retained by the university for the following season.\nDespite some optimism with several high-impact transfers brought in over the off-season, the 2022\u201323 Hoyas failed to improve from the prior year's low. The team would lose its first 9 conference games, extending the record of consecutive conference game losses to 29, until they eventually beat DePaul 81\u201376 on January 24, at Capital One Arena. The Hoyas would only win more game after this point and finished the year at 7\u201325, matching the program's high water mark for losses, just set the previous season. The team lost in the 2023 Big East tournament 48\u201380 to Villanova. \nThe following day, the university announced that Ewing would not return as coach, ending his six-year run at his alma mater. His Georgetown coaching career ended with a record of 75\u2013109 (.408) and 28\u201381 (.257) in the Big East; both are the lowest winning percentages for a coach in the modern era of the program.\n\nEd Cooley era (2023\u2013present)\nOn March 20, 2023, Ed Cooley accepted an offer to become the new head coach of the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team after 12 years in the same role at conference rival Providence College. The decision to hire Cooley was praised as a move likely to strengthen the program.\n\n2023-24 Season\nThe 2023\u20132024 Hoyas started the season 7\u20134, with a notable last second win at Notre Dame, its first victory over the Irish on the road since the 2013 season (when they were a fellow member of the Big East). The team lost several close games in conference play, including its much anticipated matchup against Providence, one of the most watched college basketball games of the season. Ultimately Georgetown finished 2\u201318 in the league and 9\u201323 overall. The two league wins however matched the number of wins the Hoyas had the prior two seasons combined in Big East play.\n\n2024-25 Season\nThe team's roster was completely overhauled before the 2024\u20132025 season. Headlined by Top 50 high school recruit Thomas Sorber, reigning Ivy League freshman of the year Malik Mack (from Harvard), and highly regarded graduate transfer Micah Peavy (from TCU), the recruiting class was ranked as the 29th best in the country. The Hoyas got out to their best start in over a decade, as they began the year 12\u20132. The strong start included Cooley's first win at rival Syracuse in the 100th matchup of the storied rivalry, and a 3\u20130 record to begin Big East play with wins over Creighton, Seton Hall and Xavier. \nGeorgetown struggled with injuries down the stretch, most significantly losing Sorber for the season in early February.  Georgetown was selected to play in the inaugural 2025 College Basketball Crown postseason tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada.  The Hoyas won their opening round game versus Washington State, 85\u201382 before losing in the Quarterfinals to Nebraska 81\u201369.  The finished the year 18-16 (8-12 in the Big East).   \nIn June, two Hoyas were selected in June at the 2025 NBA Draft. Sorber was chosen 15th overall by the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Peavy went 40th overall to the New Orleans Pelicans. Sorber's selection made him the first player in program history to be drafted directly into the NBA as a freshman. The 2025 draft marked the sixth time since 1980 (and the first time since 2008) that a pair of Georgetown teammates were selected in the same draft.\n\nAwards and honors\nSeason-by-season results\nConference Championships: 11\n\nEastern Intercollegiate Conference (1932-1939): 1\nBig East Conference (1979\u20132013): 10\nBig East Conference (2013\u2013): 0\nConference tournament championships: 11\n\nECAC Regional Tournaments: 3\nBig East Conference (1979\u20132013): 7\nBig East Conference (2013\u2013): 1\nNCAA Tournament\n\nAppearances: 31\nFinal Four appearances: 5\nNational runners-up: 3\nNational championships: 1\nOverall record: 47\u201330\nNational Invitation Tournament\n\nAppearances: 13\nRunners-up: 2\nChampionships: 0\nOverall record: 15\u201314\n\nPostseason history\nNCAA tournament seeds\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nNCAA tournament results\nGeorgetown has made 31 appearances in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

The two schools have been playing each other since 1930, but their rivalry was solidified in the 1980s as the respective programs were the leading powers during the infancy of the newly formed Big East conference. In 1980, the first season of new conference, Georgetown famously ended Syracuse's 57-game home winning streak in the final game to be played at Manley Field House before moving to the Carrier Dome. After the win, Georgetown coach John Thompson declared, \"Manley Field House is officially closed\".   Weeks later, the two schools met in the inaugural Big East Championship, with Georgetown prevailing 87\u201381. The teams met in four Big East tournament championship games during the 1980s, with Georgetown winning all four contests.\nThe animosity between the programs was further extended when Syracuse announced their decision to leave the Big East effective in 2013 to join the ACC, forcing the split of \"Catholic Seven\" and the football-playing schools. This led to the creation of the reformed Big East Conference and the American Athletic Conference. However, Georgetown and Syracuse have continued to play each other in all but one of the years following their exit from the conference. The rivalry is currently renewed through the 2024\u201325 season.\nVillanova University\nAs a fellow Catholic institution and conference foe, Villanova has been a natural rival for the Hoyas for many years. The schools are arguably two of the most successful programs among the group of teams that currently make up the Big East Conference. The rivalry is best known for the 1985 NCAA Championship Game where No. 8-seeded Villanova shocked the highly favored and top-ranked Hoyas 66\u201364, preventing Georgetown from winning back-to-back titles.\nAmong current Big East Conference foes, Georgetown and Villanova are the closest in proximity, with roughly 100 miles separating the campuses.\nSt. John's University\nHaving first played each other in 1909, St. John's is one of Georgetown's oldest rivals. The two teams played off and on since that first contest until 1965, when they began annually scheduled games, and they only intensified when both programs became founding members of the Big East Conference in 1979. The rivalry was brought to national attention during the 1984-85 NCAA Division I men's basketball season when both programs were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 throughout the season and met on a total of four occasions, including the famous \"Sweater Game\" at Madison Square Garden, the 1985 Big East Championship, and the 1985 Final Four. The Hoyas won 3 of the 4 matchups that year.\nThe rivalry gained renewed interest when both schools remained in the new Big East Conference following the many iterations of conference alignment.\nUniversity of Connecticut\nAn original member of the Big East, UConn and Georgetown battled for conference supremacy for multiple decades, until UConn left the conference to join the American Athletic Conference in 2013. One of the most intense periods for the rivalry was the 1995\u20131996 season where both teams found themselves ranked in the Top 5 throughout most of the year, led by stars Allen Iverson and Ray Allen respectively. During the regular season, Georgetown upset then ranked No. 3 UConn in Washington, D.C., but a few weeks later at Madison Square Garden, UConn prevailed in a classic Big East tournament Final 75\u201374, on a last second shot by Allen.\nUConn is the only team to match Georgetown's record of 10 regular season titles and 8 conference tournament titles. The schools continued to play each other in their non-conference schedule, and have renewed their rivalry now that UConn has returned to the league in 2020.\n\nBlue and gray\nGeorgetown's official colors are blue and gray. The colors were selected in 1876 by the Georgetown College Boat Club (the original crew team) in honor of Georgetown students and alumni who wore the Union blue and Confederate gray in the Civil War. A student committee declared blue and gray \"as appropriate colors for the Boat Club and expressive of the feeling of unity between the Northern and Southern boys of the College\", and recommended its adoption for the team. By the time the men's varsity basketball team was formed, the blue and gray colors were already widely adopted by the school.\nPresently, Georgetown is one of the few teams to wear gray as their primary home uniform color, as traditionally teams wear white uniforms at home (though the Hoyas do have a white alternate jersey that is worn on occasion). Fans are generally encouraged to wear gray to home games, and sellouts are referred to as a \"gray out.\"\n\nKenner League\nEach summer Georgetown University's McDonough Gymnasium hosts the Kenner League. Named after one of the founders and first director of the Metropolitan Police Boys' and Girls' Club of Washington, D.C., the Kenner league is the only NCAA sanctioned summer league in Washington, D.C. Formed in 1982, the league allows Georgetown players to continue their development in an NCAA-structured environment, and to stay within view of watchful eyes on a college campus (even if the coaches were not allowed there by NCAA rules). From its humble beginnings, the Kenner legacy continued to build throughout the 1980s, with coverage in The Washington Post beginning around 1986, then a high school bracket following soon thereafter, and ultimately the arrival of \"senior\" teams featuring a mix of former Georgetown players, visiting NBA stars, and local hoop legends.\nKenner continued to grow, with more fans making the trip weekly to the gymnasium for a series of weeknight and weekend games each summer. As new recruits arrived at Georgetown, following them at the Kenner League became a priority for fans. Many fans might think Georgetown runs the Kenner League, but it does not. The league is an independent effort, whose organizers must raise money from Nike and team sponsors to cover the cost of officials, jerseys, and other organizational costs, and maintain NCAA certification. As summer leagues go, Kenner is among the longest running of its kind. Since the league has been in existence, nearly 200 Georgetown players have played in the Kenner League. After nearly a two-year break due to COVID-19, Kenner League returned in the summer of 2022.\n\nAlumni\nThe Hoyas have an excellent history of preparing players for the NBA. Two Hoyas were the NBA first overall draft picks: Patrick Ewing in 1985 and Allen Iverson in 1996. Alonzo Mourning was the second overall pick in the 1992 draft. Dikembe Mutombo also was drafted in the first round, 4th overall Other alumni have gone undrafted, but entered the NBA later, such as Jaren Jackson in 1989 and Henry Sims and Chris Wright in 2013, and 3-time NBA Dunk Contest champion, Mac McClung\nSeveral Hoya basketball players are famous purely for their off-court accomplishments. Brendan Gaughan, who walked onto the basketball squad, is a driver in NASCAR's Truck Series and also raced one season in the Cup Series. James L. Jones, who played for the Hoyas in the mid-1960s before joining the Marine Corps, went on to become Commandant of the Marine Corps, Supreme Allied Commander Europe, and President Obama's National Security Advisor. Paul Tagliabue, who played in the early 1960s and was one of the leading rebounders in school history, became Commissioner of the National Football League from 1989 to 2006 and later served as Georgetown's Chairman of the board of directors. Henry Hyde, who led Georgetown to its first national final, was elected a member of Congress from Illinois and Chairman of House Judiciary Committee. He received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom. William Shea, who played in the 1920s, was the New York attorney who brought the New York Mets to the city. Shea Stadium, now demolished and replaced on-site by the Mets' current home of Citi Field, was named in his honor.\n\nNBA draft picks\nBasketball Hall of Fame inductees\nElmer Ripley (coach) - inducted in 1973\nBuddy Jeannette (coach) - inducted in 1994 (as a player)\nJohn Thompson (coach) - inducted in 1999\nPatrick Ewing - inducted in 2008\nAlonzo Mourning - inducted in 2014\nDikembe Mutombo - inducted in 2015\nAllen Iverson - inducted in 2016\n\nSee also\nBig East Conference\nGeorgetown Hoyas women's basketball\nGeorgetown Hoyas\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "biography": "The Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team represents Georgia State University and competes in the Sun Belt Conference of NCAA Division I. The Panthers play at the Georgia State Convocation Center in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The team is currently coached by Jonas Hayes. Georgia State has appeared six times in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, most recently in 2022.\n\nFacilities\nGSU Convocation Center\nIn 2018, GSU announced that the 8,000-seat Georgia State Convocation Center, hosting the men's and women's basketball teams, was being developed near the recently acquired Turner Field property. Ground was broken the same year, and the facility was completed in time for the 2022\u201323 season. The 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2) facility was officially opened on September 13, 2022 and seats 7,300 for basketball games, 7,500 for commencement ceremonies, and 8,000 for concerts.\n\nGSU Sports Arena\nThe Panthers previously played their home games at the GSU Sports Arena, located at 125 Decatur Street in the heart of the Georgia State campus. The facility was originally built in 1972 as a student gym and classroom space for physical education classes. The arena has a capacity of 3,854. The basketball court was named the Charles \"Lefty\" Driesell Court in honor of the former Panthers men's basketball coach. After the 2014\u201315 season, the center-hanging scoreboard was replaced with a four-sided hanging video scoreboard.\nPlans were released in 2012 to renovate the arena to turn the court 90 degrees, allowing for the court to be completely surrounded by seating with a new capacity of 5,000. These plans have since been abandoned in favor of a brand-new arena adjacent to Georgia State Stadium, which was previously known as Turner Field.\n\nPractice Facility\nIn March 2014, work was started on a practice facility for the team as part of an incentive package at the request of head coach Ron Hunter.\nIn April 2016, the facility was completed, slightly under its initial $1 million budget. The facility was built using an unused aquatics facility, with the court being built over the swimming pool after being filled in with concrete and padding. The court is named for Patty Ferrer and Cathy Henson, whose families were the main contributors to the project. The facility is shared between the men's and women's basketball teams, as well as the indoor volleyball team.\n\nCoaches\nPrior to hiring Rob Lanier as head coach, the Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team was led by interim coach, Travis Williams. Most recently, Williams served as an assistant coach under Ron Hunter. Before that, Williams led a successful playing career for the Panthers\u2014totaling over 1,000 career points before graduating in 1995. He also formerly led GSU as an assistant coach under Charles \"Lefty\" Driesell.\n\nBob Reinhart\nCoach Bob Reinhart led the Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team from 1985 until 1994. His overall record at Georgia State was 107\u2013148. He has the second-most wins in Georgia State history (107), and is first all-time in tenure (9 seasons); his winning percentage (.420) places him fourth all-time.\nWhen Reinhart took the head coaching job at Georgia State, the Panthers had just gone 2\u201326 the season prior. In his first season, the team finished with 10 wins. In the 1990\u201391 season, Reinhart's team finished the regular season 13\u201314 before achieving a series of \"firsts\" for Georgia State in the conference tournament. GSU had never before won a game in the conference tournament, had never beaten Little Rock, and had been swept in the regular season by all three teams they would end up facing. The fifth-seed Panthers went on to beat Stetson, USTA and Little Rock to win their first Trans America Athletic Conference tournament title and earn the school's first NCAA tournament bid.\nReinhart was twice named Coach of the Year by the Atlanta Tip-Off Club. The first award came after the 1990\u201391 TAAC tournament championship season. He was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017.\nReinhart was fired after the 1993\u201394 season and was replaced by Carter Wilson, his assistant at GSU and former player and assistant at Decatur High School.\n\nLefty Driesell\nCharles \"Lefty\" Driesell became the Panthers' head coach for the 1997\u201398 season and remained in that position for six years. He won 103 games and lost 59, giving a .636 win percentage. During his time coaching the Panthers, he won the 2000, 2001, and 2002 regular season conference title, the 2001 conference tournament, and advanced to the second round of the 2001 NCAA tournament.\nAfter the 2017\u201318 season, Driesell was inducted to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nRod Barnes\nCoach Rod Barnes, former Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year (2001), coached the Georgia State Panthers men's basketball team from 2007 until 2011. In that time, he managed 44 wins for 79 losses. At the end of the 2010\u201311 season, athletics director Cheryl Levick fired him with a year remaining on his contract.\n\nRon Hunter\nOn March 21, 2011, president Mark P. Becker and director of athletics Cheryl L. Levick announced Ron Hunter as the new head men's basketball coach at Georgia State University. Previously, Hunter spent 17 years as head coach at IUPUI. Known for his affiliation with Samaritan's Feet, a charity that donates shoes to children, Hunter brought with him a tradition of playing one game per season barefoot in an effort to raise awareness to his cause.\nHunter inherited a team mostly put together by his predecessor, a lineup that had only managed 12 wins the previous season. With this team, he finished with a 22\u201312 record\u2014which was just the ninth winning season the program had achieved since its inception in 1984.\nHis son, R. J. Hunter, remained in Indianapolis to finish his high school career with his mother while Hunter coached in Atlanta. R. J. was actively recruited the elder Hunter to play at Georgia State, where he committed over Virginia Tech, Wake Forest and Iowa. R. J. would eventually go on to become the school's all-time leading scorer while breaking many other offensive records.\nCoach Hunter became the third Georgia State coach to take the Panthers to the NCAA tournament during the 2015 iteration of the event. After beating Georgia Southern in the SBC tournament, Coach Hunter tore his achilles tendon while running to his son R. J. Hunter in celebration, garnering attention from the media before their trip to the NCAA's. Due to his injury, Hunter was forced to coach in the NCAA tournament from a rolling stool. After a dramatic comeback over the third seeded Baylor Bears capped by a deep three-pointer shot by his son, R. J., Coach Hunter fell off his stool in celebration. This resulted in a media firestorm resulting in multiple interviews, features, and a spot in \"One Shining Moment\" at the conclusion of the tournament. The Panthers would be eliminated from the tournament in the next round by Xavier.\nAfter the 2018\u20132019 season, Ron Hunter had the most wins in Georgia State history (171) and guided GSU to six post-season berths in his eight seasons at the helm. Under Ron Hunter, GSU also won Sun Belt Conference titles in 4 of his last 6 seasons, which included regular season championships in 2014, 2015 and 2019 and tournament championships in 2015, 2018 and 2019. During Hunter's tenure, the program produced the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year three times: R. J. Hunter (2014, 2015) and D'Marcus Simonds (2018). Some of the most notable victories in Hunter's tenure included VCU, Baylor, Georgia Tech, Georgia and Alabama.\n\nRob Lanier\nRob Lanier, former associate head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers, was hired as head coach of the Panthers on April 5, 2019. His previous head coaching experience was with the Siena Saints, where he led the team to one NCAA Tournament appearance in four years, progressing through the First Four in the 2002 edition.\nLanier's first season finished with a 19\u201313 record, but the Panthers fell to rival Georgia Southern in the quarterfinals of the Sun Belt Conference tournament. The following season, Lanier led the Panthers to a victory over crosstown foe Georgia Tech, 123\u2013120 in quadruple overtime. The game was GSU's first win over an ACC opponent, and saw several program records set, including most points scored in a game. The 2020\u201321 squad were ultimately crowned Sun Belt regular season champions, and reached the Sun Belt Conference tournament final, where they lost the championship game 80\u201373 to Appalachian State.\nBringing back a senior-laden veteran roster, Lanier's third team at GSU was the preseason favorite in the Sun Belt Conference. While the regular season league crown went to Texas State, GSU clinched the conference tournament title with a win over Louisiana in the tournament title game, securing an NCAA Tournament automatic bid\u2014the Panthers' fourth in eight years. Drawing a 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament, GSU were running number one overall seed Gonzaga close, trailing 62\u201358 with 10\u00bd minutes remaining, before eventually falling to a 93\u201372 defeat. Lanier left to take up the head coaching role at Southern Methodist University after GSU's elimination.\n\nJonas Hayes\nOn April 11, 2022, Jonas Hayes was officially introduced as Georgia State's men's basketball head coach. Hayes spent the previous four seasons as an assistant coach at Xavier. On March 16, 2022, Hayes was named interim head coach for Xavier, where he led the program to its first NIT championship in 64 years. Xavier's unexpected run in the NIT included wins over Florida, Vanderbilt, St. Bonaventure and Texas A&M.\nHayes is well known in the Atlanta area, as he and his twin brother Jarvis were standout players at the University of Georgia from 2001 to 2004. Hayes helped lead the Bulldogs to appearances in the 2002 NCAA Tournament and the 2004 NIT.\n\nConference membership\nSun Belt Conference (1976\u20131981)\nIndependent (1981\u20131983)\nTAAC/Atlantic Sun (1983\u20132005)\nColonial Athletic Association (2005\u20132013)\nSun Belt Conference (2013\u2013present)\n\nPostseason\nConference tournament championship results\nThroughout its years in the TAAC/Atlantic Sun, Colonial Athletic Association, and Sun Belt Conference, Georgia State has made it to the conference championship 10 times.

While Georgia Southern leads the all-time series, Georgia State has won more games in the last 10 years. Home court advantage typically plays a major factor in this rivalry as the home team won every game from 1996 until 2019 (did not play between 1996 and 2009). That streak was broken on March 9, 2019 when Georgia State defeated Georgia Southern in Statesboro in a de facto regular season conference championship game by a score of 90\u201385. Georgia Southern defeated Georgia State 79\u201370 on February 28, 2020 in Atlanta. This game snapped the home winning streak for Georgia State going back to 1992.\nGeorgia Southern holds a 38\u201326 series lead over the Panthers, but GSU has won 7 of the past 9 matchups, including three straight. GSU is 2\u20130 against Georgia Southern in the Sunbelt Conference tournament.\n\nGeorgia State vs. Louisiana\nThe Panthers and the Ragin' Cajuns have only met 19 times in the history of their programs, but the game quickly evolved into a heated rivalry shortly after Georgia State re-joined the Sun Belt Conference in 2013. Since 2013, the Panthers and Cajuns have combined for three regular season SBC championships and three SBC tournament championships. Also since that time, GSU and ULL have led the conference in wins, respectively. Ron Hunter was 11\u20135 against Louisiana Coach, Bob Marlin, during his tenure with the Georgia State program.\nAt the conclusion of the 2021\u20132022 season, Georgia State holds a 17\u20137 lead over the Ragin' Cajuns.\n\nGeorgia State vs. Troy\nGeorgia State and Troy have met off and on since 1952. They began to play each other regularly while both teams were members of the Atlantic Sun Conference until 2005 when both members left. The two became conference mates again in 2013 when Georgia State joined the Sun Belt Conference.\nUnder Coach Ron Hunter, the rivalry remained a competitive match-up as the Panthers were just 7\u20138 against the Trojans during that time period. In fact, since Georgia State rejoined the Sun Belt, Troy has proven to be the Achilles' heel for the Panthers as they are the only conference foe they have failed to secure a winning record against.\nOne of the most memorable games of the series came when the Trojans famously upset the Panthers 85\u201381 on February 15, 2014 in a nationally televised game. This game was notable because it not only ended Georgia State's 14 game winning streak (the longest in school history), but would be the only game to tarnish the Panthers' otherwise perfect conference record during the 2013\u201314 regular season in which they finished 17\u20131.\nAnother memorable moment in the rivalry came during the 2017 Sun Belt Conference tournament. At #2, the Panthers were the highest seeded team remaining in the tournament. With #1 seed UT-Arlington taking an early exit, the only teams standing between Georgia State and another berth in the NCAA tournament were #6 seed Troy and #4 Texas State. The Panthers had effectively secured the easiest path to the Championship and would be favored the rest of the way. At half-time, the Panthers held a 37\u201328 lead and appeared to be on their way to the conference finals. However, Troy ultimately seized the moment from the Panthers as they went on to win 74\u201363 in yet another shocking upset in the series.\nAt the conclusion of the 2021\u201322  season, Troy holds a 22\u201320 edge over the Panthers.\n\nSchool records\nTeam\nMost wins - 29 during the 2000\u201301 season\nLongest Winning Streak - 14 games during the 2013\u201314 regular season.\nMost free throws made in a game - 22 of 22 on January 9, 2014 against Western Kentucky\nMost assists in a game - 27 on November 14, 2015 against Tennessee Temple\nMost blocks in a game - 14 on December 1, 2011 against FIU\nLargest Margin of Victory - by 60 points on November 14, 2014 against Tennessee Temple\n\nPersonal in game\nMost points - 49 by Chris Collier (vs. Butler) on January 2, 1991\nMost field goals made - Tied 3 ways at 19, by Chris Collier (vs. Butler) on January 2, 1991; by Bob Pierson (vs. Georgia Southern) on December 14, 1976; and by Jackie Poag (vs. Chattanooga) on January 6, 1972\nMost field goal attempts - 29 by Jackie Poag (vs. Chattanooga) on January 6, 1972\nMost 3-pointers made - 12 by R.

    "biography": "The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball team represents the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in NCAA Division I basketball. The team plays its home games in McCamish Pavilion on the school's Atlanta campus and is currently coached by Damon Stoudamire. Bobby Cremins led his team to the first ACC tournament victory in school history in 1985 and in 1990 he took Georgia Tech to the school's first Final Four appearance ever. Cremins retired from Georgia Tech in 2000 with the school's best winning percentage as a head coach. The Yellow Jackets returned to the Final Four in 2004 under Paul Hewitt and lost in the national title game to UConn. Overall, the team has won 1,352 games and lost 1,226 games, a .524 win percentage.\n\nHistory\nBasketball was invented by Springfield College teacher James Naismith in 1891. It seemed to take off in the Southern colleges in 1906, when Yale's basketball team traveled throughout the South. That year Georgia Tech organized a small basketball club under Coach Chapman. Tech lost to Auburn in the first college basketball game played in Atlanta, and won the two other games they played that season, against rival Georgia.In 1909, continuous dribbling and shots off the dribble were allowed. Tech organized another basketball team, under famous coach John Heisman, also Tech's baseball and football coach. Heisman had a winning percentage of .142 that season and improved the team's percentage to .500 in 1912 and 1913. Heisman wasn't able to keep up with a basketball team, and his successor Bill Alexander revived the Georgia Tech basketball program in 1920. From 1924 to 1926, the team was coached by Harold Hansen, also the football team's backfield coach.\n\nRoy Mundorff\nRoy Mundorff coached Georgia Tech basketball from 1927 to 1942. Georgia Tech became a charter member of the Southeastern Conference in 1932 (the first season was in 1933). The 1936-37 team was captained by future Tech coach John Hyder and posted an 11-1 conference record. Tech won the conference title the next season in 1938.\n\nDwight Keith\nDuring World War II, the basketball team was coached by assistant football coach Dwight Keith.\n\nRoy McArthur\nFormer Tech quarterback Roy McArthur coached the team after the war. He was \"among the forerunners of the present run-and-shoot brand of basketball\".\n\nJohn Hyder\nCoach John Hyder, whose teams won 292 games in 22 seasons, put the program on the national map when his 1955 team defeated Adolph Rupp's Kentucky team, ending the Wildcats' 129-game winning streak at home. \nThe Yellow Jackets played their first NCAA tournament game in 1960. Led by all-American Roger Kaiser, the team defeated Ohio University before losing in the second round to the eventual champion, Ohio State. Hyder continued to have strong teams in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1964, Georgia Tech's final season in the Southeastern Conference, the team went undefeated at home and was the conference runner-up. In 1971 the Yellow Jackets, led by Rich Yunkus, reached the finals of the National Invitation Tournament but lost to the University of North Carolina.\nGeorgia Tech became a charter member of the Metro Conference in 1975 (the first season started in 1976), and then became the eighth member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 1978 (starting play in 1979). As of the 2020\u201321 season, the Yellow Jackets have won four ACC tournament championships and been the ACC's top seed twice. Through 2021, Georgia Tech has received 17 berths in the NCAA tournament, and seven of its teams have made it to the Sweet Sixteen.\n\nBobby Cremins\nThe 1985 team, led by head coach Bobby Cremins and players Mark Price, Duane Ferrell, Yvon Joseph, Craig Neal, Bruce Dalrymple, and John Salley, won the school's first ACC championship and advanced to the final eight in the NCAA tournament.  Tom Hammonds earned Rookie of the Year honors in the ACC in 1986. In the 1990 tournament, the trio of Kenny Anderson, Dennis Scott, and Brian Oliver (nicknamed \"Lethal Weapon 3\") carried the Yellow Jackets all the way to the Final Four, where they lost to eventual champion UNLV in the national semi-finals. In 1992, Cremins led an inexperienced Tech team to the Sweet 16, thanks in no small part to James Forrest's buzzer-beating game-winning three-pointer in the second round against USC. The following year, the Yellow Jackets won the ACC tournament.\nGeorgia Tech's nine consecutive appearances in the NCAA Tournament from the mid-1980s and the early 1990s accounted for the nation's fourth-longest active streak before it ended in 1994. In 1996, the team finished first in the ACC's regular season and returned to the tournament behind future NBA All-Star Stephon Marbury. In 1998, Matt Harpring was third-team All-American.\nCremins's 19-year tenure (1981\u20132000) stands as the team's most successful era. Cremins is Georgia Tech's all-time winningest coach and is third among all ACC coaches. Upon his retirement after the 1999\u20132000 season, his teams had won 354 games and lost 237 for a .599 winning percentage (Cremins would later come out of retirement to coach at the College of Charleston). The floor at McCamish Pavilion is named \"Cremins Court\" in his honor.\n\nPaul Hewitt\nIn 2000, head coach Paul Hewitt was hired away from Siena College and immediately helped to revitalize the Yellow Jacket program. In his first season, Georgia Tech beat UCLA, Kentucky and five ACC rivals that were ranked en route to an NCAA tournament appearance. Georgia Tech experienced a Cinderella season in 2003\u201304: winning the Preseason NIT, ending Duke's 41-game winning streak at Cameron Indoor Stadium, making it to the school's second Final Four and first national championship game, in which they lost by nine points to UConn. Notable players sent to the NBA under Hewitt include Chris Bosh, Jarrett Jack, Mario West, Luke Schenscher, Thaddeus Young, Will Bynum, and Anthony Morrow. In back-to-back years (2008 & 2009), Hewitt also successfully recruited national top-10 high school prospects in Iman Shumpert and Derrick Favors.\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, the Yellow Jackets played for the ACC tournament championship game as well as earning Hewitt's fifth NCAA tournament appearance at Tech. They advanced to the round of 32, losing to Ohio State. Georgia Tech then finished the 2010\u201311 season 13\u201318. On March 12, 2011, Paul Hewitt was dismissed as the head coach of the Georgia Tech after eleven seasons. Brian Gregory was appointed as his successor, Georgia Tech's 13th men's basketball coach, on March 28, 2011.\n\nBrian Gregory\nBrian Gregory, who led Dayton to 97 victories over his last four seasons there and worked under Tom Izzo at Michigan State when the Spartans won the 2000 NCAA championship, was named Georgia Tech's head men's basketball coach on March 28, 2011. In their first season with Gregory at the helm, Georgia Tech finished 11\u201320 and 11th in the ACC while playing without a true home court while McCamish Pavilion was under construction. Gregory only had two seasons with overall winning records and no seasons of winning records in ACC play. On March 25, 2016, after five disappointing seasons and no trips to the NCAA tournament, Georgia Tech fired Brian Gregory. He was 76\u201386 overall and 27\u201361 in ACC play.\n\nJosh Pastner\nJosh Pastner was hired by the school on April 8, 2016. Pastner was 167\u201373 with four NCAA tournament bids in seven years as the head coach of Memphis.\nPastner took Tech to the NIT finals in his first season, and was that season's ACC Coach of the Year. After that season Tech was hit with NCAA violations, although most punishments would later be dropped. Because of this, Tech struggled for the next few seasons. However, Pastner ultimately led the team to their first ACC title since 1993, as well as their first NCAA tournament berth since 2010, as the Yellow Jackets defeated Florida State to win the 2021 ACC championship. They would end up losing to Loyola Chicago in the first round of the NCAA tournament. It is Tech's latest postseason appearance. \nThe success wouldn\u2019t last though, Tech parted ways with Pastner on March 10, 2023 following two disappointing seasons. He finished 109\u2013114 in his seven years coaching the Jackets. He finished as the fourth-winningest coach in school history, behind only Hewitt, Hyder, and Cremins.\n\nDamon Stoudamire\nOn March 13, 2023 Damon Stoudamire was named the fifteenth coach in program history. Stoudamire came to Georgia Tech after serving as an assistant coach of the NBA's Boston Celtics for nearly two seasons. Before that he served as the head coach at the University of the Pacific from 2016 to 2021. \nDamon Stoudamire became the first Tech coach in the Yellow Jackets\u2019 ACC history to defeat Duke in his first try when the Yellow Jackets stunned the then seventh ranked Blue Devils 72\u201368 on December 2, 2023. He became the third coach in ACC history to beat Duke and North Carolina in his first year when on January 30, 2024, Tech beat #3 UNC 74\u201373 in front of a sold out home crowd. \nStoudamire's first team finished 14\u201318 despite the big wins, but in his second year at the helm Tech would turn an 8\u201311 start into a 17\u201316 record at the end of the ACC Tournament. The Yellow Jackets were invited to the 2025 NIT, which marked their first postseason appearance since the 2021 ACC championship season.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Yellow Jackets have appeared in the NCAA tournament 17 times. Their combined record is 23\u201317.\n\nNIT results\nThe Yellow Jackets have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) nine times. Their combined record is 14\u201310.\n\nCoaches\nPlayers\nMany famous and talented players have played with the Yellow Jackets. Dennis Scott was the 1990 National Player of the Year and the 1990 ACC Player of the Year, Jarrett Jack was the 2005 Basketball Times All-South player.\nA notable fictitious player for the Yellow Jackets is eternal Tech student George P. Burdell, who is officially listed in team media guides as having earned three letters (1956\u201358).\n\nBasketball Hall of Famers\nGeorgia Tech has one alumnus in the Basketball Hall of Fame, Chris Bosh who played at Tech from 2002\u20132003.\n\nRetired numbers\nAll-Americans\nAll-time leaders\nBlocks\nArena\nThe Hank McCamish Pavilion, rebuilt and renamed from Alexander Memorial Coliseum (also nicknamed \"The Thrillerdome\") in 2012, is an indoor arena located on Tech's Midtown Atlanta campus. It is the home of the Georgia Tech basketball teams and hosted the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association from 1968 to 1972 and again from 1997 to 1999. Tech's women's volleyball team occasionally uses the facility as well, primarily for NCAA tournament games and other matches that draw crowds that would overflow the O'Keefe Gymnasium. During the 2011\u201312 season, the Yellow Jackets split their home schedule between Philips Arena and the Arena at Gwinnett Center in suburban Duluth while McCamish Pavilion was under reconstruction.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website \n\"Digital Collection: Georgia Tech Basketball Programs and Guides\". repository.gatech.edu.\n\"Collection: Georgia Tech Men's Basketball Programs and Guides | Georgia Tech Archives Finding Aids\". finding-aids.library.gatech.edu.",

    "biography": "The Gonzaga Bulldogs are an intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Gonzaga University. The school competes in the West Coast Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Gonzaga Bulldogs play home basketball games at McCarthey Athletic Center in Spokane, Washington, on the university campus.\nGonzaga has had 15 of its players receive the WCC Player of the Year award, and two players, Frank Burgess in 1961 with 32.4 points per game, and Adam Morrison in 2006 with 28.1 points per game, have led the nation in scoring. Morrison was named the Co-National Player of the year for the 2005\u201306 season.\nSince the mid-1990s, Gonzaga has established itself as a major basketball power in a mid-major conference. They have been to every NCAA tournament held since 1999, a year in which they made a Cinderella run to the Elite Eight, and have appeared in every final AP poll since the 2008\u201309 season.  Gonzaga had an active weekly poll streak of 143 weeks, starting from the 2016\u201317 season and ending on January 15, 2024, being tied for the tenth longest streak in Division I history.  They have also appeared in all but one WCC conference title game since 1995, and in every conference title game since 1998, winning 21 of them. \nThe 2016\u201317 Bulldogs went to the program's first-ever Final Four, advancing to the 2017 national championship game, where they lost to North Carolina. They returned to the Final Four in 2021, losing in the national championship game to Baylor.\n\nTeam history\nEarly years\nGonzaga introduced a basketball program during the 1907\u201308 basketball season and, although the season wasn't an official one, they achieved a record of 9\u20132 (.818) under head coach George M. Varnell. In the 1908\u201309 season, Varnell became the first official coach for Gonzaga, earning a 10\u20132 (.833) record. William Mulligan coached the following season and acquired an 11\u20133 (.786) record. Frank McKevitt took over for Mulligan during the 1910\u201311 basketball season, acquiring an 8\u20131 (.889) record. From 1944 to 1994, the Bulldogs compiled a record of 628\u2013531 (.542), earning regular season titles in 1965\u201366 and 1966\u201367 (Big Sky) under Hank Anderson, and in 1993\u201394 (WCC) under Dan Fitzgerald. That season also saw the team qualify for its first postseason tournament, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), while being led by forward Jeff Brown, who was the WCC Player of the Year, and point guard Geoff Goss, who was made the All-WCC First Team that season. In the following season, the fourth-seeded Bulldogs won the WCC tournament to secure their first appearance in the NCAA tournament.\n\nDan Monson (1997\u20131999)\nIn 1997, Gonzaga assistant coach Dan Monson, the son of veteran Oregon and Idaho head coach Don Monson, became the head coach of Gonzaga as Fitzgerald wanted to focus on his athletic director's duties. During his first season, Monson led the Zags to a 24\u201310 record and a WCC regular season title, which was not enough to land an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament. They earned a bid into the NIT and beat Wyoming 69\u201355 in the first round in Laramie, but fell at Hawai'i 78\u201370 in the second round.\nDuring the 1998\u201399 season, the Bulldogs had a 28\u20137 record after winning the conference tournament, and were seeded tenth in the West regional of the NCAA tournament. In the tournament's \"Cinderella\" run and Gonzaga's \"coming out party\" (Gonzaga has made the NCAA tournament each year since) the Zags beat seventh-seeded Minnesota 75\u201363 in the first round in Seattle and followed it with an 82\u201374 win over second-seeded Stanford to advance to the regional semifinals in Phoenix. Gonzaga beat Florida 73\u201372 to advance to the regional finals after Casey Calvary tipped in the winning basket with four seconds remaining. They trailed eventual national champion UConn by one point with a minute remaining before losing 67\u201362 in the regional finals.\n\nMark Few (1999\u2013present)\nAfter Monson departed for Minnesota that summer, assistant coach Mark Few was promoted to head coach on July 26, 1999.\nIn his inaugural season, Few led the Zags to a 26\u20139 record, which was highlighted by winning the WCC tournament and advancing to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament with wins over Louisville and St. John's in Tucson, Arizona.\nIn the 2000\u201301 season, the Bulldogs faced a tough schedule highlighted by games against Arizona, Washington, Florida, and New Mexico. Despite starting the season 5\u20131, the Zags dropped four of their next five games. Gonzaga rebounded and finished the regular season 15\u20136 before winning their third consecutive WCC tournament title. The win gave the Bulldogs an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament, where they were seeded twelfth in the South regional. In the first round in Memphis against fifth-seeded Virginia, Casey Calvary put back a blocked shot with nine seconds left to give the Zags an 86\u201385 victory. Gonzaga then beat 13th-seeded Indiana State 85\u201368 in the second round to advance to their third consecutive Sweet 16. In Atlanta, the Zags lost to defending national champion Michigan State 77\u201362 and finished the season with a 26\u20137 record.\nPrior to the 2001\u201302 season, the Bulldogs were unanimously favored to win the WCC title in the WCC preseason coaches poll. Few led the Zags to a share of the WCC regular season title, as Pepperdine also had a 13\u20131 conference record. The Bulldogs would avenge their only conference loss of the season by defeating Pepperdine 96\u201390 for their fourth straight WCC tournament title. The win gave the Zags an automatic bid as a six-seed in the NCAA tournament, opening against 11th-seeded Wyoming. Despite beating the Cowboys four years earlier in the NIT, they lost 73\u201366, marking the first time the Zags lost in the first round of the tournament under Mark Few.\nIn the 2002\u201303 season, Few led the Bulldogs to their fifth regular season title in six years with a 12\u20132 conference record. Despite this, Gonzaga lost to San Diego in the WCC tournament championship game 72\u201363, marking the first time the Zags had lost in the championship game in four years. Gonzaga garnered a nine-seed in the 2003 NCAA tournament, where they beat Cincinnati 74\u201369 to advance to the second round of the tournament for the fourth time in five years. The Bulldogs would go on to lose to Arizona 96\u201395 in double overtime to finish 24\u20139.\nThe 2003\u201304 season marked the first time that the team participated in the annual Battle in Seattle game. Gonzaga faced third-ranked Missouri, who was the highest-ranked regular season opponent that the Zags had played against up to that point; they would go on to win the game in an 87\u201380 overtime victory. This season marked the last time Gonzaga would play home games in the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre; their last game in the building took place February 28, 2004, where they beat Santa Clara 80\u201364. The win gave the Bulldogs their first undefeated run through the WCC in school history with a 14\u20130 conference record. Gonzaga would go on to receive an automatic bid into the 2004 NCAA tournament with a two-seed, which was the highest seed they had received in school history in seven tournament appearances. The Bulldogs would go on to beat 15th-seeded Valparaiso 76\u201349 before being upset in the second round by tenth-seeded Nevada 91\u201372, where they finished the season 28\u20133.\nGonzaga opened up the 2004\u201305 season with a home game against Portland State in the new 6,000-seat McCarthey Athletic Center on November 19, 2004. Despite losing five seniors, including second-round NBA draft pick Blake Stepp, Few was still able to lead the Zags to their ninth regular season title since 1994 with a 12\u20132 conference record. The Bulldogs would go on to win their second straight WCC Tournament title, giving them an automatic bid into the 2005 NCAA tournament as a three-seed. The Zags beat 14th-seeded Winthrop 74\u201364 before falling to Texas Tech 71\u201369 in the second round, where they ended the season with a 26\u20135 record.\nBefore the 2005\u201306 season got underway, Gonzaga junior Adam Morrison became the first player in team history to be named to the preseason Associated Press All-America team. The Zags also received their highest preseason ranking in program history at number seven in the USA Today/ESPN preseason poll. The Bulldogs captured their third straight WCC Tournament title when they beat Loyola Marymount 68\u201367 in the championship game. They received an automatic bid into the 2006 NCAA tournament as a three-seed, where they beat Xavier 79\u201375 in the first round. The Zags would go on to beat Indiana Hoosiers 90\u201380, where they would advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2001. Despite being ahead by as many as 17 points, the Bulldogs ended their season in the Sweet 16 by losing to UCLA 73\u201371, finishing 29\u20134.\nThe 2006\u201307 season marked the first time that the Zags suffered at least ten losses in a season since the 1997\u201398 season. Despite this, Few still led the Bulldogs to their seventh straight regular season title with a conference record of 11\u20133. Gonzaga would go on to win the WCC Tournament for the fourth year in a row, being the only Division I school to do so that year. They received an automatic bid into the 2007 NCAA tournament, where they were given a 10-seed. The Zags would end their season by losing in the opening round for the first time since 2001, as Indiana beat Gonzaga 70\u201357.\nIn 2007\u201308 the Bulldogs went 25\u20138, but lost in the Round of 64 as a #7 seed to a Davidson team that went to the Elite Eight as a #10 seed.\nThe 2008\u201309 team won both the WCC Regular Season Championship and the WCC Tournament Championship. Entering the NCAA tournament as a #4 seed, the team reached the Sweet Sixteen, before losing to eventual NCAA Champions North Carolina.\nFor the next five seasons, the team advanced to the NCAA tournament, but fell in the Round of 32 each time. The 2012\u201313 team became the first Gonzaga squad to be ranked as the #1 team in the country and was awarded as a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament for the first time. The Zags also won over 30 games for the first time in program history with a 32\u20133 overall record.\nThe  2014\u201315 team advanced all the way to the Elite Eight before losing to eventual national champion Duke. This was the first time since 1999 that Gonzaga had advanced to the Elite Eight. Gonzaga also won the WCC regular-season and tournament championships for the third consecutive season. The 2014\u201315 also set the school record for wins in a single season with 35.\nThe 2015\u201316 team suffered 4 losses at home and nearly missed the NCAA tournament entirely, but shared the WCC regular-season crown with Saint Mary's and then won the WCC Tournament. The Zags were awarded a #11 seed and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, dismantling #6 seed Seton Hall and #3 seed Utah, before falling to Syracuse by three points.\nThe 2016\u201317 team won its first 29 games, setting a new school record for consecutive games won, before falling to WCC rival BYU. The Zags made the NCAA tournament as a #1 seed and advanced to the school's first-ever championship game, with wins over South Dakota State, Northwestern, West Virginia, Xavier, and South Carolina. The Zags set a new school record for wins in a single season with 37 and also had the most wins of any team that season.\nThe 2017\u201318 team also enjoyed success. Despite what was considered a \"rebuilding year\" after the Loss of Karnowski, Williams-Goss, Mathews and Collins among others (causing the Bulldogs to not be picked to win the West Coast Conference), the team won the WCC regular season title outright before winning the WCC tournament. In the NCAA tournament, the Bulldogs advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the fourth consecutive year. They were ultimately bounced by Florida State, and finished the season at 32\u20135.\nNear the end of that season, Gonzaga considered a potential move to the Mountain West Conference (MW) after nearly 40 years as a WCC member. When asked by a reporter from the San Diego Union-Tribune about rumored MW expansion plans, MW commissioner Craig Thompson confirmed that six schools had been considered, with Gonzaga being the only school he specifically named. A later Union-Tribune report indicated that talks were advanced enough that the conference's presidents planned a vote on an invitation to Gonzaga during the MW men's and women's basketball tournaments in Las Vegas, but decided to delay the vote until after the Final Four. The vote ultimately never took place, as Gonzaga athletic director Mike Roth notified both conferences during the Final Four that the school would remain in the WCC for the immediate future.\nIn the 2018 Maui Invitational Final on November 21, 2018 #3 Gonzaga defeated #1 Duke 89\u201387 for their first win over Duke and first win over a number 1 ranked team in team history.\nThe 2020\u201321 season would be a historic year for the team, going 26\u20130 in the regular season and being the final undefeated team in the country. They would earn the #1 overall seed in the tournament and cruise to the national championship game over Norfolk State, Oklahoma, Creighton, USC, and UCLA. In the national championship, their undefeated season came to an end, losing to Baylor 86\u201370.\n\nFacilities\nBasketball started at Gonzaga in February 1905 after a gymnasium was put in as an addition to the east end of the new college building that was being built. In 1955, the basketball team moved from the gymnasium, nicknamed \"the cave\", and began to play at the newly constructed Spokane Coliseum. On June 3, 1964, construction began for a new 3,800-seat athletic facility called the John F. Kennedy Memorial Pavilion. To raise money for the $1.1 million project, Gonzaga's student body had each student pay $10 per semester until $500,000 was raised. The university matched that amount, while the remaining $100,000 came from contributions. Gonzaga's first game in the pavilion took place on December 3, 1965, against Washington State, who beat the Bulldogs 106\u201378. In 1986, the facility was renamed the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre after an eponymous donor donated $4.5 million to finance a remodel of the arena that could hold up to 4,000 people.\nAfter competing for over 39 years in the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, Gonzaga trustees approved construction for a new 6,000-seat arena on April 11, 2003. The McCarthey Athletic Center was named after Gonzaga trustee Philip G. McCarthey and Gonzaga regent Thomas K. McCarthey, who contributed a significant portion of the funds needed to build the arena. The first official game took place on November 19, 2004, against Portland State, whom the Zags would beat 98\u201380 in front of a sold-out crowd. The Bulldogs opened the arena with a 38-game winning streak, which was the nation's longest active winning streak at the time. When combined with 12 wins at the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, the overall home-game winning streak ended at 50 games with a loss to the Santa Clara on February 12, 2007. In February 2015, BYU snapped Gonzaga's 41-game home winning streak in the McCarthey Athletic Center, which was also the longest active home winning streak in the NCAA at the time.\nThrough February 6, 2020, the Zags are 223\u201315 (.937) in the McCarthey Athletic Center, which includes a 105\u20138 (.929) record in non-conference games, a 116\u20137 (.943) record in conference games, and a 2\u20130 (1.000) record in the WCC Tournament.\n\nTraditions\nBattle in Seattle\nOn December 13, 2003, Gonzaga participated in a neutral court game at KeyArena that would later become an annual event known as the Battle in Seattle. The event marked the first time that a regular season Gonzaga basketball game was broadcast nationally on CBS Sports, as Craig Bolerjack called the action while Clark Kellogg provided commentary. Ranked third in the country, Missouri was the highest ranked regular season opponent that Gonzaga had faced up to that point; the Bulldogs would go on to beat the Tigers 87\u201380 in overtime.\nThe 2005 Battle in Seattle is remembered for Adam Morrison's game-winning shot against Oklahoma State that sealed a 64\u201362 victory for the Bulldogs. Gus Johnson's call at the end of the game with Bill Raftery was ranked fourth on a list of 25 of his most \"over-the-top calls\" by Complex. Johnson's call at the end of the game:\n\nZags no timeouts. They gotta hurry. But here comes the All-America. Morrison... six... fires... OH... HE BANKED IN A THREE! [Raftery shouts \"OH!\"] OH... WOW... [Raftery: ONIONS!] WHAT A GAME... [Raftery shouts \"OH!\" again] LARRY BIRD... BABY... [Raftery makes an unintelligible sound...] WHOA! [Raftery laughs in the background... Replay is shown as Raftery says, \"Look at the clock. And when you're sleepless in Seattle, why not get a little kiss... Gus... Oh! Major onions... all on his own! Look at the contesting... oh, what a smooch... woo... wow!\"] Crunch time you go to your best player. [Raftery says, \"This kid is extraordinary... and watch the contesting Gus, it's not like he's standing still. Two defenders, knowing... look at that.] Adam Morrison refusing to let his team lose.\nIn 2008, the game broke the state attendance record for a regular season college basketball game, as a sold-out crowd of 16,763 watched the Bulldogs play Connecticut.\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, Gonzaga failed to schedule the Battle in Seattle, ending an annual tradition of participating in the event every December for 13 consecutive years. Representatives from the Zags cited an inability to find a quality opponent to schedule and wanting to maintain strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The Zags have compiled an 9\u20136 (.600) record in the event since they first appeared in it back in 2003.\nIn 2023, #10 Gonzaga was defeated 76-63 by the #5 UConn Huskies, two-time defending national champions, in the Continental Tire Seattle Tip-Off, a non-Battle in Seattle event. Attendance at Climate Pledge Arena was 16,405.\n\nRivalries\nSaint Mary's College (California)\nGonzaga's biggest rivalry is with fellow West Coast Conference foe Saint Mary's. Many analysts and members of the media have touted the Gaels vs. Zags as one of the best, if not the best, college basketball rivalry on the West Coast, as both teams have been consistently the two top teams in the conference over the last 2 decades. Gonzaga and Saint Mary's have combined to win 24 out of the last 26 conference championship games (Gonzaga 20, Saint Mary's 4, San Diego 2). Currently Gonzaga leads the series 81\u201335.\n\nWashington State\nGonzaga also has an in-state rivalry with Washington State. The two schools are both based in Eastern Washington, with Pullman only 79 miles away from Spokane. Following the collapse of the Pac-12 and Wazzu's temporary move to the West Coast Conference for some sports including basketball, the rivalry became renewed in the 2024\u201325 season. In October 2024, Gonzaga announced that they had joined the new Pac-12, solidifying the return of the rivalry. The Cougars lead the series 98\u201354, but Gonzaga has won 15 of the last 18 matchups, including the two WCC Conference games in the 2024\u201325 season.\n\nWashington\nGonzaga's most heated in-state rivalry is with Washington. They played a 10-year home-and-home series from 1997 to 2006, but then it went dormant until they were forced to play each other in first round of the 2015 Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. In 2016, they began a new home-and-home series in Spokane and have agreed to continue the rivalry annually until at least the 2025\u201326 season. The Huskies lead the series 30\u201320. Although the Zags have won 14 of the last 16 matchups, the most recent game was won by Washington on December 9, 2023, 78\u201373.\n\nBrigham Young University (BYU)\nA notable rivalry with Brigham Young University (BYU) has developed throughout the past decade. BYU and Gonzaga first played on December 16, 1949, with Gonzaga winning 46\u201341.  The two teams would not meet again until March 19, 2011, in the third round of the NCAA tournament, as a BYU team led by Jimmer Fredette advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by defeating the Zags 89\u201367. The following season, BYU left the Mountain West Conference and joined the West Coast Conference for the 2011\u20132012 season. BYU is one of few teams to win multiple times at the McCarthy Athletic Center in Spokane over the last decade, with wins at the Kennel in 2015, 2016 and 2017. BYU was the only team to beat #1 ranked Gonzaga during the 2016\u201317 regular season in which Gonzaga earned its first trip to the Final Four and National Championship game. BYU has played Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference tournament Final in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2021 with Gonzaga winning all four of these matchups. Gonzaga leads the overall series 25\u20137, with the most recent meeting on February 11, 2023, in which Gonzaga won 88\u201381 in Spokane. BYU departed the WCC for the Big 12 Conference, starting with the 2023\u20132024 season, and since then, no matchups have been confirmed for the future between the Cougars and Zags.\n\nImpact\nUniversity enrollment\nFreshman enrollment at Gonzaga in the mid-nineties hovered around 500 students annually, including a total of 569 as late as 1998. In 1999, enrollment jumped to 701 five months after the Zags went to the Elite Eight. This trend continued after Gonzaga won five games in the 1999 and 2000 NCAA tournaments, as freshman enrollment increased to 796 in 2000 and to a then-record 979 in 2001. A 65 percent increase in the size of the freshman class between 1997 and 2003 is part of a phenomenon called the Flutie effect, the increase in attention and applications for admission that results after a particularly notable and unexpected sporting victory by a school's athletic team.  Gonzaga University president Rev. Robert Spitzer said that the team's success was responsible for the school receiving the $23 million required to build the McCarthey Athletic Center, most of which was received through major gifts.\nGonzaga has been viewed as reaping benefits from its basketball-related exposure to this day. The university's financial position and fundraising success dramatically improved. This led to a campus building boom; the McCarthey Athletic Center proved to be just the first of a series of major campus buildings that opened between 2004 and 2017. Booming freshman enrollment led Gonzaga to introduce a more selective admissions process in 2003, which led to a significant increase in the academic credentials of incoming freshmen. Even with greater selectivity, freshman enrollment has continued to grow, reaching 1,200 for 2016\u201317.\n\nHead coaching records\nSeason-by-season results\nUnder Mark Few:\n\nGonzaga vs. the AP Top 25 (since 1998\u201399)\nSince the season of Gonzaga's 1999 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament run to the Elite 8, Gonzaga has played a total of 139 games against teams ranked in the AP Top 25 Poll. Gonzaga has a record of 64\u201375 (.460) against such teams. They have beaten top-3 teams seven times in all, taking down #3 teams four times (Missouri in 2003\u201304, Georgia Tech and Oklahoma State in 2004\u201305, and Iowa in 2020\u201321), #2 twice (North Carolina in 2006\u201307 and UCLA in 2021\u201322), and #1 once (Duke in 2018\u201319).\n\nTeams in bold represent games Gonzaga played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\n\nWCC Tournament results\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in 27 NCAA tournaments.

The school's team currently competes in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. They currently play their home games at the Fredrick C. Hobdy Assembly Center. They made their first ever appearance to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2024.\n\nHistory\nThe glory years of the Tigers were led by Fred Hobdy, who led the Tigers to eight SWAC regular season titles (five outright) during his coaching tenure. Hobdy went 572-288 as head coach from 1957 to 1986, which saw them play in NCAA Division II and the NAIA. They reached the Elite Eight of the Division II tournament in 1958 and won the NAIA title in 1961. Notable players during this time were Willis Reed, who was an NAIA All-American before becoming drafted by the New York Knicks; Reed was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982. \nThe Tigers advanced to the 1980 SWAC men's basketball tournament against Alcorn State (the regular season champion) for a chance to reach the NCAA Division I Tournament but lost 83\u201361. In 1986, Hobdy retired, later serving as athletic director for the program from 1989 to 1996 prior to his death in 1998 (years later, Grambling's new Assembly Center would be named after him). The 1986-87 team won the regular season championship but were walloped 105-55 by Southern in the SWAC Final. They returned to the Final the following year and lost again to Southern 78\u201362. Grambling won a share of the regular season title for the 1988-89 season with Southern and Texas Southern after each had 10-4 records, but Grambling lost in the Semifinals to Texas Southern, who then lost to Southern. The Tigers, with a record of 8\u201310 in SWAC play and seeded 6th, pulled off two shocking upsets (of three-seeded Mississippi Valley State and two-seeded Jackson State) to advance to the final round of the SWAC men's basketball tournament for the fourth time in program history in 2011 but lost to fourth-seeded Alabama State. \nThe 2012\u201313 team became the eighth NCAA Division I team to finish a season winless. The 2022\u201323 Tigers team returned to the SWAC Tournament title game for the fifth time in school history only to lose against Texas Southern, 58\u201361, for the right to advance to the NCAA Tournament. \nOn March 16, 2024, Grambling won the 2024 SWAC tournament after winning the regular season title, defeating the three-time defending champion Texas Southern, earning its first NCAA tournament bid in program history. The Tigers beat Montana State in the First Four, 88\u201381 in overtime, giving them their first win in the tournament.\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA Division I Tournament results\nThe Tigers appeared in one NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

  "Houston Cougars": {
    "biography": "The Houston Cougars men's basketball team represents the University of Houston in Houston, Texas, in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. They compete as members of the Big 12 Conference. In addition to 26 NCAA tournament appearances, the Cougars have won 22 conference championships and have had several players and a coach elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nHistory\nEarly history (1945\u201356)\nAlthough the University of Houston already had a women's basketball program, the Houston Cougars men's basketball program did not begin until the 1945\u201346 season. Alden Pasche was the team's first head coach. In their first two seasons, the Cougars won Lone Star Conference regular-season titles and qualified for postseason play in the NAIA Men's Basketball tournaments in 1946 and 1947. The Cougars had an all-time NAIA tournament record of 2\u20132 in two years.\nDuring Pasche's tenure, the Cougars posted a 135\u2013116 record. Under his leadership in 1950, the Cougars won the Gulf Coast Conference championship. Future College Basketball Hall of Fame coach Guy Lewis played for Pasche, eventually becoming an assistant coach before being handed the job upon Pasche's retirement.\n\nGuy Lewis era (1956\u201386)\nPasche retired after the 1955\u201356 season, and Houston assistant Guy Lewis was promoted to the head coaching position. Lewis, a former Cougar player, led Houston to 27 straight winning seasons and 14 seasons with 20 or more wins, including 14 trips to the NCAA tournament. His Houston teams made the Final Four on five occasions (1967, 1968, 1982\u201384) and twice advanced to the NCAA Championship Game (1983, 1984). Among the outstanding players who Lewis coached are Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, Otis Birdsong, Dwight Jones, Dwight Davis, Don Chaney and Louis \"Sweet Lou\" Dunbar.\nLewis's UH teams twice played key roles in high-profile events that helped to popularize college basketball as a spectator sport. In 1968, his underdog, Elvin Hayes-led Cougars upset the undefeated and top-ranked UCLA Bruins in front of more than 50,000 fans at Houston's Astrodome. The game became known as the \u201cGame of the Century\u201d and marked a watershed in the popularity of college basketball. In the early 1980s, Lewis's Phi Slama Jama teams at UH gained notoriety for their fast-breaking, \"above the rim\" style of play as well as their overall success. These teams attracted great public interest with their entertaining style of play. At the height of Phi Slama Jama's notoriety, they suffered a dramatic, last-second loss in the 1983 NCAA Final that set a then-ratings record for college basketball broadcasts and became an iconic moment in the history of the sport. Lewis's insistence that these highly successful teams play an acrobatic, up-tempo brand of basketball that emphasized dunking brought this style of play to the fore and helped popularize it amongst younger players.\nHouston lost in both NCAA Final games in which Lewis coached, despite his \"Phi Slama Jama\" teams featuring superstars Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon. In 1983, Houston lost in a dramatic title game to the North Carolina State Wolfpack on a last-second dunk by Lorenzo Charles. The Cougars lost in the 1984 NCAA Final to the Georgetown Hoyas, led by Patrick Ewing. Lewis retired from coaching in 1986 at number 20 in all-time NCAA Division I victories, his 592\u2013279 record giving him a .680 career winning percentage.\nAs a coach, Lewis was known for championing the once-outlawed dunk, which he characterized as a \"high percentage shot\", and for clutching a brightly colored red-and-white polka dot towel on the bench during games. Lewis was a major force in the racial integration of college athletics in the South during the 1960s, being one of the first major college coaches in the region to actively recruit African-American athletes. His recruitment of Elvin Hayes and Don Chaney in 1964 ushered in an era of tremendous success in Cougar basketball. The dominant play of Hayes led the Cougars to two Final Fours and sent shock waves through Southern colleges that realized that they would have to begin recruiting black players if they wanted to compete with integrated teams.\n\nWelcome to Conference USA (1996\u20132004)\nAfter 21 years in the Southwest Conference, the Cougars joined Conference USA in 1996. Under head coach Alvin Brooks, the basketball program had a disappointing initial season in C-USA. The team went 3\u201311 against C-USA teams in 1996\u201397. The next season was even more futile. Brooks, who had led the Cougars since 1993, coached the Cougars to a rock bottom conference record of 2\u201314 in 1997\u201398. The last, and only other, time the Cougars recorded only two conference victories in a season was in 1950\u201351; their first season in the Missouri Valley Conference.\nOne of Houston's biggest sports icons and one of the Cougars best basketball players ever, Clyde Drexler was hired to coach the program that he led as a player to the 1983 NCAA Final as part of Phi Slama Jama. Basketball excitement was back on campus, and fans looked forward to the promising years to come. After just two seasons with minimal success, Drexler resigned as head coach citing his intention to spend more time with his family.\nRay McCallum was hired to do what Clyde Drexler could not\u2014lead the Cougars to a winning season and earn a spot in the NCAA tournament. After losing seasons in each of his first two years, McCallum guided the Cougars to an 18\u201315 record in 2001\u201302. That season, the team won two conference tournament games and qualified for the National Invitation Tournament. However, the team regressed in the following season and failed to qualify for even their own C-USA tournament.\n\nTwo steps forward, one step back (2004\u201307)\nTom Penders was named as the head coach of Cougars basketball in 2004. Known as \"Turnaround Tom\" for his reputation of inheriting sub-par basketball programs and making them better, Penders was hired to rebuild a program that recorded only one winning season in its last eight years. After a surprising debut season in 2004\u201305 that led to an NIT appearance, the team had high hopes to build on their relative success and make the NCAA tournament in 2006.\nThe 2005\u201306 season looked promising at the outset. The Cougars started their first game on a 30\u20130 scoring run against the Florida Tech Panthers. Less than two weeks later, the Cougars beat the nationally ranked LSU Tigers on the road and the Arizona Wildcats at home. The surprising wins earned the Cougars their first national ranking in several years. The team that seemed destined for an NCAA tournament berth failed to capitalize on their success and national recognition and began to stumble after a loss to South Alabama Jaguars in December. The Cougars won only one conference tournament game and had to settle again for another NIT bid.\nDubbed as \"The Show,\" the 2006\u201307 Cougars entered the season with cockiness and strong expectations to finally make it into the NCAA tournament. A difficult schedule matched the Cougars with seven different teams that would end up qualifying for either the 2007 NCAA tournament or NIT. Houston lost three times to the Memphis Tigers and once each to Arizona, the Creighton Bluejays, the Kentucky Wildcats, South Alabama, the UNLV Runnin' Rebels, and the VCU Rams. By going 0\u20139 against these quality teams, the Cougars proved they were not worthy of an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. Not surprisingly, two conference tournament wins against lower seeds and an unimpressive 18\u201315 overall record were not even enough to earn the team an invitation to the NIT.\n\nTeam goal: NCAA tournament (2007\u201310)\nIn 2007\u201308 the team introduced a new nickname (\"The Show\u2014In 3D\") and a slightly new uniform (a changed trim design). The team hoped to reach the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1992. Eight straight home games from November 21 to December 29 helped the Cougars get off to an 11\u20131 start. However, the team lost most of its critical games at the end of the season, including their last two games (both against the UTEP Miners). Houston received an invitation to the inaugural College Basketball Invitational tournament and defeated the Nevada Wolf Pack and the Valparaiso Crusaders but lost to their conference rival, the Tulsa Golden Hurricane, in the semifinal round.\nThe 2008\u201309 season began on November 11 with a two-point loss to the Georgia Southern Eagles; this was the first game of the Division I college basketball season and the opening game of the 2K Sports Classic tournament in Durham, North Carolina. A Cougars win would have meant a second round matchup with the Duke Blue Devils. Overall, the Cougars played a balanced home and away regular season schedule. Fifteen games (three in November, three in December, four in January, three in February, and two in March) were played at Hofheinz Pavilion. There were 14 away games (two in November, two in December, five in January, and five in February).\nThe 2009\u201310 team finished the regular season 15\u201315 and 7\u20139 in C-USA, finishing seventh place in the conference. Following a 93\u201380 win over East Carolina in the first round of the C\u2013USA Tournament, the Cougars beat Memphis 66\u201365, ending a string of four tournament titles for the Tigers. In the next game, they defeated Southern Miss 74\u201366 to advance to the championship game. Finally, the Cougars beat #25 ranked UTEP 81\u201373 to earn the conference's bid to the NCAA tournament, their first since 1992. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, Houston, seeded 13th, was defeated 89\u201377 by 4th-seeded Maryland.\nPenders announced his resignation as Houston head coach on March 22, 2010.\nThe school hired James Dickey on March 21, 2010.\n\nJoining the American (2013\u201323)\nBeginning with the 2013\u201314 season, Houston joined the newly created American Athletic Conference following the Big East realignment.\nIn March 2014, Dickey stepped down as head coach because of \"private family matters\". In four seasons with Houston, Dickey amassed a 64\u201362 record with no NCAA tournament appearances or conference titles.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, Houston hired Kelvin Sampson as the new Cougars head coach. Sampson had just become eligible to be a college coach again after receiving a five-year show cause penalty in 2008 for sanctions against him during his time as Indiana head coach. In 2014\u201315, Sampson's first season, Houston struggled again, finishing with a 13\u201319 record and 4\u201314 in the AAC.\nThe 2015\u201316 team led a resurgence, finishing 22\u201310 overall, 12\u20136 in conference, but lost in the AAC tournament and in the first round of the NIT.\nIn 2017\u201318, the Cougars compiled a 27\u20138 overall record, reaching the finals of the AAC tournament and winning a game in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1984.\nIn 2018\u201319, the Cougars' success continued as they set a program record for wins with a 33\u20134 mark. They were AAC regular-season champions but fell in the finals of the conference tournament. They proceeded to the NCAA tournament, where they reached the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 35 years.\nIn 2020\u201321, the Cougars were ranked as high as No. 5 in the nation. After winning the AAC Tournament, the Cougars were awarded a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament. UH defeated Cleveland State, Rutgers, Syracuse and Oregon State to achieve their first Final Four appearance since 1984. They would lose to eventual national champions Baylor in the Final Four.\nDuring the 2021\u201322 season, the Cougars won the AAC regular season championship with a 15\u20133 conference record. They then defeated Cincinnati, Tulane and Memphis to win the conference tournament. With the conference championship, an overall record of 29\u20135 and ranked No. 15 in the nation, Houston received a #5 seed in the NCAA tournament.

  "Illinois Fighting Illini": {
    "biography": "The Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big Ten Conference, that represents the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The Illini play their home games at the State Farm Center, located on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's campus in Champaign. Illinois has one pre-tournament national championship and non-NCAA tournament national championships in 1915 and 1943, awarded by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Illinois has appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament 35 times, and has competed in 5 Final Fours, 10 Elite Eights, and has won 18 Big Ten regular season championships, and 4 Big Ten Tournament Championships.\nThe team is currently coached by Brad Underwood, who was hired on March 18, 2017. Through the end of the 2023\u201324 season, Illinois ranks 13th all-time in winning percentage and 13th all-time in wins among all NCAA Division I men's college basketball programs.\n\nHistory\n1906\u201312: Early years\nThe Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team began play during the 1905\u201306 season with Elwood Brown guiding the team to a 9\u20138 record as their first coach. Frank L. Pinckney took control of the team before the start of the 1906\u201307 season. The team would win their first game but would end up dropping the next 10 contests.\nAnother coaching change led to Fletcher Lane being in charge of the team for the 1907\u201308 season. After starting the season 14\u20131 in non-conference, Illinois would finish the season losing five of their 11 conference games, ending the year third in the Western Conference with a 20\u20136 (6\u20135) record.\nEven though Lane led a successful season, his style of coaching was deemed subpar. Former Illini player Herb Juul was then hired as the head coach of the 1908\u201309 squad. The Illini would not see the same success as the season prior, finishing the season with a 7\u20136 (5\u20136) record. Despite the struggles, Juul became the first coach in Illinois history to return for more than one season. However, the 1909\u201310 season would be his last as the Illini finished with a 5\u20134 (5\u20134) record.\nThomas E. Thompson took the reins before the 1910\u201311 season. The Illini would finish fourth in the Western Conference after earning a 6\u20136 (6\u20135) record. The 1911\u201312 season was Thompson's last year as head coach of the Illini after they finished with an 8\u20138 (4\u20138) record.\n\n1912\u201320: Ralph Jones era\nBefore the start of the 1912\u201313 season, Illinois hired former Purdue head coach, Ralph Jones. During his three seasons in West Lafayette, Jones compiled a 32\u20139 record, while also winning the previous two Western Conference titles. During his first season with Illinois, Jones led the Illini to a 10\u20136 record which was Illinois' second 10-win season in school history.\nDuring the 1914\u201315 season, Illinois won their first-ever Big Ten title, going 16\u20130 (12\u20130). They were retroactively declared champion of that season by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. They would earn another Big Ten title during the 1916\u201317 season, sharing it with Minnesota.\n\n1936\u201347: Douglas Mills era\nBefore the start of the 1936\u201337 season, Douglas R. Mills began acting as the head coach and athletic director of the Illinois men's basketball team. In his first season, the Illini finished with a 14\u20134 (10\u20132) record, which was good enough to share the Big Ten title with Minnesota.\nBefore World War II broke out, the Fighting Illini men's basketball program had achieved a status that had never been seen prior. Mills grouped a team of players, all around 6-foot-3, into a nearly undefeatable lineup later known as the \"Whiz Kids\". The 1941\u201342 freshman and sophomore lineup of Arthur Smiley, Ken Menke, Andy Phillip, Gene Vance, Victor Wukovits, and Art Mathisen dominated the Big Ten by posting a 13\u20132 conference record and winning the conference title outright. It would be their first unanimous Big Ten championship since 1915.\nThe Illini finished 1942\u201343 season with a 17\u20131 (12\u20130) record, winning their second-straight Big Ten title. Despite being ranked No. 1 in the nation, they opted not to play in the 1943 NCAA tournament after three of their five starters were called to duty in World War II. At the end of the season, they were named Premo-Porretto Pre-Associated Press Poll national champions.\nThe 1946\u201347 season, would be Mills' last season as the head coach of the Illini. The team ended the season with a 14\u20136 (8\u20134) record, finishing one game behind Wisconsin in the Big Ten standings. Under Mills, the Illini compiled a record of 151 wins and 66 losses while winning three conference championships in the process.\n\n1947\u201367: Harry Combes era\nChampaign High School basketball coach Harry Combes was hired to succeed Doug Mills as Mills left the position to focus on his duties as the athletic director. Through his first five seasons as head coach, Combes led the Fighting Illini to three NCAA Final Four appearances in 1949, 1951, and 1952. During his tenure as coach, Combes increased the Fighting Illini's offensive output by changing their style of play. Combes implemented Full-court press defense, causing turnovers at a high rate which translated into Fast break points.\nIn 1951, Combes signed the first black player to don an Illinois uniform, 3x All-State point guard Walt Moore of Mount Vernon. Along with teammate and future Illinois standout Max Hooper, Moore led the Rams to back-to-back state championship titles, culminating with a perfect 33\u20130 record in 1950.\nDuring the 1957\u201358 season, Mannie Jackson and Govoner Vaughn were inserted into the starting lineup as the first two African-Americans to start and letter in basketball at Illinois. Combes also oversaw the Illini's move from Huff Hall to Assembly Hall in 1963 and during that same season the Illini won a fourth Big Ten Conference championship under Combes. However, the Illini lost to eventual national champion Loyola (Chicago) in the Elite Eight of the 1963 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The following 1964\u201365 season, saw several upset victories over defending national champion UCLA Bruins and national powerhouse Kentucky Wildcats at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington, Kentucky.\nCombes' tenure came to an end as a result of the University of Illinois slush fund scandal. As head coach of the basketball team, he was primarily responsible for the basketball fund, and thus held a key role in the scandal. Assistant basketball coach Howie Braun also lost his job due to the scandal.\n\n1967\u201374: Harv Schmidt era\nFormer Illini player Harv Schmidt was hired to fill the head coaching vacancy ten days after Combes' forced resignation. During his tenure, the Illini compiled an 89-77 overall record but went 43-55 in conference play. The team did not have any postseason appearances during his tenure.\n\n1974\u201375: Gene Bartow year\nGene Bartow would later sign a five-year contract to replace Schmidt in 1974, but he left after one season in which the Illini finished last place in the conference to replace John Wooden at UCLA.\n\n1975\u201396: Lou Henson era\nIn 1975, after having taken New Mexico State (and future Illinois assistant coach Jimmy Collins) to the 1970 Final Four, Lou Henson moved to the University of Illinois to replace Gene Bartow, after Bartow left Illinois to replace the legendary John Wooden at UCLA. Henson would lead the Fighting Illini back to their glory after having a number of difficult years following the Illinois slush fund scandal (where Illinois was hit with severe penalties for infractions that other Big 10 schools had in years prior been punished much more leniently (according to Sports Illustrated) at the time). In 21 years at Illinois, Henson garnered 423 wins and 224 losses (.654 winning percentage), and with a record of 214 wins and 164 losses (.567) in Big Ten Conference games. The 214 wins in Big Ten games were the third highest total ever at the time of his retirement. At Illinois, Henson coached many future NBA players, including Eddie Johnson, Derek Harper, Ken Norman, Nick Anderson, Kendall Gill, Kenny Battle, Marcus Liberty, Steve Bardo, and Kiwane Garris.\n\nEarly 1980s\nIn 1981, Illinois made strides in its return to the national spotlight with a 21\u20138 record, a third-place Big Ten finish and an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. The team received a first-round bye in the NCAA Tournament and beat Wyoming, 67\u201365, in Los Angeles to advance to the regionals in Salt Lake City, where Illinois lost to Kansas State, 57\u201352. During this season, the Fighting Illini led the Big Ten in scoring for the second consecutive season and were again led by Eddie Johnson and Mark Smith. Guards Craig Tucker and Derek Harper arrived to add backcourt punch, and Harper began his Illini career being named First-Team Freshman All-America by ESPN and ABC.\n\nFlyin' Illini\nThe top-seeded and top-ranked 1989 Illini were upset 83\u201381 in the Final Four on a last second basket by Michigan's Sean Higgins, ending the school's deepest run in the tournament at that time. Illinois had beaten the Wolverines by 12 and 16 points in two previous meetings that season. The 1988\u201389 Illinois Fighting Illini team gained the moniker \"Flyin' Illini\" by Dick Vitale during an ESPN broadcast that season. The team also gained national prominence for its athletic players, such as NCAA slam dunk champions Kenny Battle and Kendall Gill, as well as Lowell Hamilton, Nick Anderson, Marcus Liberty, and Stephen Bardo.\n\n1990s\nThe early 1990s Illini were dominated by players such as guards Andy Kauffman, Richard Keene, and Kiwane Garris, as well as centers Shelly Clark and Deon Thomas. Thomas was at the center of a report of misconduct by Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball assistant coach Bruce Pearl, who alleged that Thomas had been offered cash to attend Illinois. The Illini were suspended from postseason play for one season for unrelated violations uncovered during the investigation.\n\n1996\u201300: Lon Kruger years\nAfter longtime coach Lou Henson's departure, Illinois hired Lon Kruger to fill the vacancy for the 1996 season. Kruger was the 14th head basketball coach in program history. During his four-year tenure he compiled a 59\u201338 record. He immediately made an impact at Illinois leading them to a 22\u201310 record and a second round NCAA tournament appearance in his first year. This created excitement because of the ninth-place finish the Illini had taken just before his arrival. Kruger inherited players such as Victor Chukwudebe, Jerry Hester, Kevin Turner, Jerry Gee, Matt Heldman, Brian Johnson, Kiwane Garris and Cleotis Brown. During his four seasons at Illinois, three of which resulted in NCAA Tournament berths, (all three of which saw the Illini eliminated in the 2nd round) Kruger became the only Big Ten coach to successfully sign three consecutive Illinois Mr. Basketball winners, inking Sergio McClain, Frank Williams, and Brian Cook between 1997 and 1999.Several times during his coaching tenure the Illini were predicted to be at the bottom of the Big Ten, however he overcame adversity each time performing far better than expected.\n\n2000\u201303: Bill Self years\nIllinois picked Tulsa coach Bill Self from a list of numerous candidates, including popular assistant Jimmy Collins, to succeed Kruger, who moved on to the NBA to coach the Atlanta Hawks. Bill Self was hired to the Illini coaching staff as the 15th head coach in the history of the program. He spent his previous seven years as the head coach of Oral Roberts University and Tulsa University where he compiled an overall record of 129\u201371. In 2001, his first season at Illinois, Self coached his new Fighting Illini squad to a 27\u20138 record, a share of the Big Ten title, and a number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. That 27-game winning season in Self's first year was the second most winning season in school history at that time. McClain, Cook and preseason Big Ten player of the year Cory Bradford led the Illini to the Elite Eight, where they fell to eventual finalist Arizona in a much disputed contest. The Illini were accused of being overly physical most of the season, especially McClain and pesky guards Sean Harrington and Lucas Johnson (younger brother of former Illini forward Brian Johnson). The '01 Illini team also included Robert Archibald, Damir Krupalija and Marcus Griffin. With mostly the same core, Illinois followed up the season with impressive 2002 and 2003 campaigns, but fell in the Sweet 16 in 2002. He was the first head coach in the Big Ten, since 1912, to lead his team to conference championships in each of his first two seasons. It was also the first time Illinois won back-to-back titles in 50 years. Self, also, had an overall record of 78\u201324 in his three years as Illinois head coach. Self left for Kansas after the 2003 season.\n\n2003\u201312: Bruce Weber era\nBruce Weber served as the head coach of Illinois basketball for nine seasons from 2003 to 2012.\nAfter Bill Self left, Illinois AD Ron Guenther hired Weber to coach the Fighting Illini on April 30, 2003. Weber came from Southern Illinois University (SIU) in Carbondale and was touted as a loyal coach, which was valued by the Illinois AD after both Kruger and Self left Champaign with relatively short tenures. In his five seasons as head coach at SIU, Weber took the Saluki program to the top of the Missouri Valley Conference, winning league titles in 2002 and 2003. He posted records of 28\u20138 and 24\u20137 in his last two seasons, leading the Salukis to back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances, including a run to the Sweet 16 in 2002 with wins over Texas Tech and Georgia at the United Center in Chicago. His .689 (62\u201328) winning percentage in MVC play ranked 12th in the long history of the league. Weber earned Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year honors following the 2003 season.\nIllinois totaled 210 victories under Weber from 2004 to 2012. He ranks third on the Illinois career coaching wins list. He won 67.5 percent of his games while in charge of the Fighting Illini (210\u2013101). Under Weber, the Illini had two Big Ten Championships (2004, 2005), two runner-up finishes (2006, 2009) and seven upper-division finishes.\nIllinois had five players selected in the NBA draft under Weber, as Deron Williams (No. 3, Utah Jazz) and Luther Head (No. 24, Houston Rockets) were taken in the first round of the 2005 NBA draft, and James Augustine (No. 41, Orlando Magic) and Dee Brown (No. 46, Utah Jazz) were chosen in the second round of the 2006 NBA draft. Meyers Leonard was chosen 11th by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2012 NBA draft following Weber's final season.  Utah's selection of Williams at No. 3 overall in the 2005 lottery made him the highest-drafted player in Illinois history.\nIt took just one season for Weber to etch his name in the Big Ten and Illinois record books after leading the Fighting Illini to its first outright Big Ten title in 52 years during the 2003\u201304 season. In leading his young team that featured just one senior on the roster, Weber became just the third coach in the history of the Big Ten to win an outright title in his first season. Illinois had to win 10 straight to end the regular season to claim the championship, including six-straight wins on the road. Illinois' 26 wins in 2003\u201304 tied the fourth-winningest season in school history. Weber also led the Illini to the Sweet 16 with NCAA Tournament victories over Murray State and Cincinnati.\nWeber's second year at Illinois, the 2004\u201305 season, will be remembered as one of the greatest in Fighting Illini history, finishing 37\u20132 as the National Runner-Up in the NCAA tournament. In a remarkable year where Illinois celebrated its centennial season of basketball, the Illini reeled off 29 straight wins to start the year, tying the 12th-best start in NCAA Div. I history and the third-best start in Big Ten history. Illinois also secured its second-straight outright Big Ten championship with a 15\u20131 league record, as Weber became the first coach in Big Ten history to win consecutive outright titles in his first two seasons. Illinois then added a Big Ten tournament championship in addition to its regular season title. The Illini were ranked No. 1 in the nation for 15 straight weeks, including a first-ever No. 1 ranking in the final Associated Press poll.\nThey gained the #1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament and prevailed in one of the most memorable games in NCAA history against Arizona. Down 15 points with around 4 minutes left, the Illini rallied with a run led by Luther Head and Deron Williams. The game was sent into overtime and the Illini pulled off a one-point win to advance to the 2005 Final Four in St. Louis. It was the Fighting Illini's first Final Four Appearance since the 1988\u201389 season. Against the Louisville Cardinals in the national semifinal game, the Illini posted their final victory of the season. All of the five Illini starters\u2013Deron Williams, Luther Head, Dee Brown, James Augustine, and Roger Powell, Jr.\u2013would eventually play in the NBA. Williams and Brown both joined the Utah Jazz roster, while Luther Head went on to play for the Sacramento Kings.\nWith all that Illinois accomplished during the season, Weber swept the 2005 National Coach of the Year awards, claiming the following: the Naismith Award, the most prestigious coaching award in college basketball; the Henry Iba Award, presented by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association; and, the Adolph F. Rupp Cup. Weber was also named National Coach of the Year by the NABC, Associated Press, The Sporting News, Basketball Times, CBS/Chevrolet, Victor Awards and Nike Championship Basketball Clinic.\nDespite losing three starters and 63 percent of its scoring from the 2004\u201305 NCAA runner-up squad, Weber directed the 2005\u201306 Illini to a third-consecutive 4829-win season, a runner-up finish in the Big Ten, the second round of the NCAA Tournament, and a ranking among the nation's top 17 teams throughout the entire season. The Illini spent the majority of 2005\u201306 ranked in the Top 10 and recorded 26 wins on the year to tie the fourth-winningest season in school history. The Illini were given a number 4 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they beat Air Force in the opening round, before falling to the University of Washington in the second round.\nThe 2006\u201307 team finished with a record of 23\u201312 (9\u20137) and finished tied for fourth in the Big Ten. With a depleted roster that had six different players combine to miss a total of 58 games due to injury, the Illini still advanced to the NCAA Tournament. They were awarded a 12 seed and lost in the opening round to Virginia Tech.\nThe 2007\u201308 season was one of the worst seasons in Illinois history, highlighted by a string of close losses. The lone bright spot came as Illinois came on strong to win four of its last five and five of its final seven games, which culminated with a runner-up finish at the Big Ten tournament. Weber's Illini became the first No. 10 seed in the tournament's history to advance to the title game, winning three games in three days with victories over Penn State, No. 17 Purdue, and Minnesota to reach the championship game vs. No. 8 Wisconsin. However, with an overall record of 16\u201319 (5\u201313), the Illini were not selected to participate in postseason play.\nWeber's 2008\u201309 UI squad was one of the most improved teams in the country finishing with a record of 24\u201310 (11\u20137). With 10 more regular season victories than it achieved the year before, Illinois posted the third-biggest turnaround in NCAA Division I and the second-biggest turnaround among BCS programs on the year. The Illini recorded 24 wins, ranking as the 10th winningest season in school history. Illinois was the Big Ten runner-up, earned a No. 5 seed in the 2009 NCAA Tournament, and finished the year ranked 24th in the Pomeroy rankings. The Illini lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to the 12th-seeded Western Kentucky Hilltoppers.\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, the Illini finished 21\u201315 (10\u20138) and finished 5th in the Big Ten. The team was widely considered to be \"on the bubble\" for the NCAA tournament and missed the tournament field by a narrow margin. The Illini competed in the NIT, falling at home to the Dayton Flyers in the NIT Quarterfinals.\nIllinois rebounded in 2010\u201311 to finish 20\u201314 (9\u20139) and tied for fourth in the Big Ten. The Illini were selected to join the NCAA tournament as a #9 seed, where they defeated the #8 seeded UNLV Rebels setting up a matchup with the #1 seeded Kansas Jayhawks and former coach Bill Self. Kansas proved to be too much for the Illini, and the season came to an end in the round of 32.\nIn 2011\u201312, Weber's last as coach of the Illini, the team finished 17\u201315 (6\u201312), good for 9th in the conference. The team did not compete in the postseason. Illinois' new AD Mike Thomas fired Weber after the 2011\u201312 season.\n\n2012\u201317: John Groce era\nJohn Groce was hired by the new athletic director Mike Thomas on March 28, 2012. During the 2012\u201313 season, the Illini were the Maui Invitational champions and later made the NCAA tournament, losing their second game to the Miami Hurricanes by a score of 63\u201359. The Illini spent eight weeks nationally ranked in the NCAA Division I rankings, and for two weeks were ranked as high as 10th in the country.\nThe 2013\u201314 season saw major roster turnover, with nine players leaving and nine players joining the program. This season was one to forget, as the Illini would ultimately miss the NCAA Tournament and lose in the second round of the NIT.\nIn 2014, Groce continued Illinois' success in November, improving to 21\u20130 under Groce and 32\u20130 overall during the past four seasons. Illinois is the only program in the nation with an undefeated November record dating back to 2011. The 2014\u20132015 season was once again disappointing for the Illini. Illinois finished with a record of 19\u201314, finishing tied for 7th place in the Big Ten with a record of 9\u20139. The Illini were then beaten in the first round of the NIT.\nThe 2015\u201316 season ended with the fewest total wins in almost 20 years since the 98\u201399 Lon Kruger crew won only 14 games. Groce's squad finished with a record of 15\u201319, taking 12th place in the Big Ten and receiving no post-season tournament invitations.\nThe 2016\u201317 season was another disappointing season for the Fighting Illini, as they finished the season at 18\u201314 and 8\u201310 in the conference, failing to make the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive year. On March 11, 2017, the university announced via press release that Groce had been relieved of his duties as head men's basketball coach. The next day, the team was put into the NIT as a 2-seed. The team was coached during the NIT by interim coach Jamall Walker, making it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated by the University of Central Florida.\n\n2017\u2013present: Brad Underwood era\nOn March 18, 2017, Brad Underwood was hired by athletic director Josh Whitman. Underwood previously coached at Stephen F. Austin from 2013 to 2016, before spending one year at Oklahoma State. In Underwood's first season at Illinois, the team won each of their first five contests. After beginning conference play 0\u20138, they ended the season with a record of 14\u201318.\nWhile the 2018\u201319 season featured the debut of key pieces including Ayo Dosunmu, Giorgi Bezhanishvili, Andres Feliz, and Alan Griffin, the Illini posted one of the worst records in program history at 12\u201321 (7\u201313 in Big Ten). Despite the poor record, Illinois had many memorable moments such as upsetting #9 Michigan State at home and Bezhanishvili scoring 35 points against Rutgers, breaking the Illini record for most points by a freshman in a single game.\nThe 2019\u201320 season was the freshman year of highly ranked center Kofi Cockburn. The Illini started the season slow in the first game, barely beating Nicholls State 78\u201370 in overtime. During the ACC\u2013Big Ten Challenge, Illinois played Miami where they lost 81\u201379 after they mounted a huge comeback before a charge was called against Dosunmu on the game's final play. The next game they traveled to College Park to play against #3 Maryland. The Illini led by 14 at the half, but Maryland outscored Illinois 34\u201319 in the second half and won the game by an Anthony Cowan free throw. The Illini next played #5 Michigan at the State Farm Center. They would beat the Wolverines 71\u201362 to improve to 7\u20133 on the season. Over the next 12 games, the Illini went 10\u20132, including Dosunmu's game-winning shot during their second matchup against Michigan to give Illinois a 64\u201362 lead with half a second left on the clock. Illinois would finish the season with a 21\u201310 (13\u20137) record which would be good enough for 4th in the Big Ten. They would also finish ranked 21st in the AP Poll and 22nd in the Coaches Poll.\nThe 2020\u201321 season that Underwood finally had mostly his recruits running the team and it certainly showed on the court. After much deliberation, Ayo Dosunmu returned to Illinois for his junior season instead of going to the NBA. He, along with Kofi Cockburn, helped make Illinois into a top-10 team. They went 16-4 (0.800) in the B1G conference but had a worse record than Michigan (14-3, 0.824), and therefore did not earn even a share of the title. This title was disputed as Michigan had failed to play three extra games because of COVID protocols, and only one loss in those three games would have given Illinois the title; Illinois had beaten Michigan by 23 without leading scorer Ayo Dosunmu in Ann Arbor. The team went on to win the Big Ten tournament title, however, after a hard-fought, overtime 91\u201388 win over OSU. Illinois became a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for the 4th time in school history.  They were upset by Loyola-Chicago in the 2nd round and finished the season 24\u20137. Dosunmu became the first player in Illini history to earn 1st-team All-America honors by the AP. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 2nd-team.\nBefore the 2021\u201322 season, Underwood's assistant coaching staff completely turned over, with Chin Coleman and Orlando Antigua going to Kentucky and Stephen Gentry returning to Gonzaga. Ayo Dosunmu was drafted by the Chicago Bulls and Adam Miller transferred to LSU, leading to Andr\u00e9 Curbelo being expected to serve as the primary ball handler. Unfortunately, Curbelo suffered a concussion prior to the season opener that would continue to affect him throughout the season. The team was led by fifth-year players Trent Frazier and Da'Monte Williams. Kofi Cockburn returned for his junior year but was suspended for the first three games for selling his team jerseys during the off-season. The team tied with Wisconsin for a share of the Big Ten regular season title, with a record of 15-5. Due to the tiebreaker rules, the team was seeded first in the Big Ten Tournament but lost its first game to ninth-seeded Indiana. The team was given the #4 seed in the South region of the NCAA tournament. After a 54-53 victory against Chattanooga, the team lost in the second round to Houston. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 1st-team.\nThe roster suffered from some major turnover before the 2022\u201323 season, with five players transferring out of the program, four players graduating, and Kofi Cockburn electing to stay in the NBA draft (and ultimately going undrafted). Three players transferred into the program and six freshmen were recruited. As a result of the roster changes, the team would be led by Terrence Shannon Jr. and Coleman Hawkins. The Illini would secure two major wins in non-conference play, beating #8 UCLA in the Continental Tire Main Event semifinal and #2 Texas in the Jimmy V Classic. Both Zacharie Perrin and Skyy Clark left the program during the season. Ultimately the season was a step back for the program, as due to tiebreaker rules, the team received a seven seed and lost to Penn State in their first game of the Big Ten Tournament. The team then received the #9 seed in the West region and lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Arkansas. For the first time since Underwood's second season, the team finished the season unranked in the AP Poll.\nThe 2023-24 season would be one to remember. Three pivotal graduate transfers, Marcus Domask, Quincy Guerrier, and Justin Harmon joined the team, with Domask and Guerrier starting most games. The Illini went on an undefeated trip to Spain and then beat #1 ranked Kansas in a televised exhibition game. The team lost only two games to non-NCAA tournament teams, once to Penn State and once to Maryland. After finishing second in the Big Ten standings, the team ultimately won the Big Ten Tournament, prevailing over Wisconsin. The team was selected to the NCAA tournament as the #3 seed in the East region. For the first time in Underwood's tenure, the team made the Sweet Sixteen, where it beat the #2 seed, Iowa State. For the first time since the 2004\u201305 season, the team made the Elite Eight, where it lost to #1-overall and eventual national champion UConn.\nMajor turnover again beset the Illini prior to the 2024-25 season. Terrence Shannon Jr. was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves and every scholarship player from the prior season save two, Ty Rodgers (who ultimately redshirted) and Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn, left the program. Assistant coaches Chester Frazier and Tim Anderson left the program, leading to the return of Orlando Antigua and the temporary promotion of Kwa Jones. The Illini had one of its strongest freshmen classes in its history, including 2025 first round picks Kasparas Jaku\u010dionis and Will Riley. Following a season plagued by injury and illness, the Illini made the NCAA Tournament as the #6 seed in the Midwest region. The team won its first game against Xavier and then lost the following game to Kentucky.\n\nRecords by Coach\nChampionships\nNational championships\nConference championships\nRegular season\n\u2020 \u2013 Conference co-champions\n\nTournament\nPostseason history\nNCAA Division I Tournament\nSeeding\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nResults\nNational Invitational Tournament\nSeeding\nThe NIT began seeding the tournament with the 2006 edition.\n\nResults\nFacilities\nKenney Gym (1905\u20131925)\nKenney Gym Annex is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose arena that is the practice facility for the Fighting Illini gymnastics team. Before the opening of Huff Hall in 1925, Kenney Gym housed the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. It also was home to the Women's Volleyball program from 1974 until 1989, after which the program moved to Huff Hall in 1990.\n\nHuff Hall (1925\u20131963)\nHuff Hall is a 4,050-seat multi-purpose arena in Champaign, Illinois, United States. The arena opened in 1925 and was known as Huff Gymnasium until the 1990s. It is named after George Huff, the school's athletic director from 1895 to 1935. Huff Hall is home to the University of Illinois Fighting Illini volleyball and wrestling teams. Before the opening of Assembly Hall in 1963, it was home to the basketball team as well.\n\nState Farm Center (1963\u2013)\nAssembly Hall opened on March 2, 1963, and hosts the home games for the men's and women's basketball teams. Max Abramovitz, an Illinois alumnus, was the lead architect behind the building of the indoor arena. At the time of its opening, Assembly Hall could hold 16,128 people, making it the largest dome structure in North America until the Houston Astrodome opened in 1965.\nIn 2008, school officials, led by athletic director Ron Guenther, conducted a study to decide whether to refurbish the Assembly Hall or build a new basketball arena. In 2010, they decided to keep the arena. In 2014, renovations began under the watch of AECOM, an architectural firm based out of Dallas Texas. The estimated cost of the project was estimated to be around $169.5 million and in turn State Farm Insurance decided to buy the naming rights of the stadium.\n\nUbben Basketball Complex (1998\u2013present)\nThe 2-story, 40,000-square-foot building is home to the University of Illinois Men's and Women's basketball programs. The facility includes offices, locker areas, weight training facilities and team meeting rooms in addition to the practice basketball courts. The Illinois Champions Campaign was a major catalyst of the $40 million renovation.\n\nPrairie Capital Convention Center (2015)\nIn November 2015, the arena hosted the team for five games while renovations to the State Farm Center were completed.\n\nRivalries\nIndiana Hoosiers\nIllinois and Indiana's rivalry started because the teams share a state border and they are located about 153 miles (246 km) apart. They have played annually since 1906. Indiana currently leads the series 96\u201393. The teams have played each other in five top-ten matchups, the first coming in 1952 when 2nd-ranked Illinois beat 4th-ranked Indiana 78\u201366.

    "biography": "The Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team represents Indiana University Bloomington in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the Big Ten Conference. The Hoosiers play at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall on the Branch McCracken Court in Bloomington, Indiana on the Indiana University Bloomington campus. Indiana has won five National Championships in men's basketball, (1940, 1953, 1976, 1981, 1987) \u2013 two coming under Branch McCracken and three under Bob Knight. Indiana's 1976 team remains the last undefeated NCAA men's basketball champion.\nThe Hoosiers are sixth in NCAA Tournament appearances (41), seventh in NCAA Tournament victories (68), tied for eighth in Final Four appearances (8), and 10th in overall victories. The Hoosiers have won 22 Big Ten Conference Championships. The Hoosiers also rank eighth in all-time AP poll appearances (580) and sixth in the number of weeks spent ranked No. 1 (54). Every four-year men's basketball letterman from 1973 to 2019 earned at least one trip to the NCAA basketball tournament.\nA 2025 study listed Indiana as the third most valuable collegiate basketball program in the country. Indiana has ranked in the top 20 nationally in men's basketball attendance every season since Assembly Hall opened in 1972, and often in the top five.\nIndiana has two main rivalries including in-state, against the Purdue Boilermakers (see Indiana\u2013Purdue rivalry), and out-of-state, against the Kentucky Wildcats (see Indiana\u2013Kentucky rivalry).\n\nTraditions\nCandy striped warm-up pants\nIndiana players wear warm-up pants that are striped red and white, like the stripes of a candy cane. They were first worn by the team in the 1970s under head coach Bob Knight. At the time they were in keeping with the fashion trends of the 1970s, and a tribute to the Harlem Globetrotters who started the trend, but despite changing styles they have since become an iconic part of playing for Indiana. IU star guard Steve Alford said, \"As you watch television and you watch the IU games, that's the first thing you saw, was the team run out in the candy stripes. So when you finally got to put those on, those are pretty special.\" Rusty Stillions, Director of Indiana's Equipment Operations, said the pants were originally available only for team members. However, changes in licensing agreements permitted the general public to buy them as well. They have since become a staple at games and other Indiana basketball events.\n\nSimple game jerseys\nThe team is widely noted for its simple game jerseys. Unlike most schools, Indiana does not have players' names on the back of jerseys that players wear on the court. The notion behind the nameless jerseys is that players play for the team name on the front, not the individual's name on the back. In keeping with Indiana's longstanding principle of putting team over player, the Hoosiers have never retired any jersey numbers. Adidas is the current outfitter of Indiana athletics.\nWhen coach Mike Davis succeeded Bob Knight, he suggested adding names to the jerseys.  However, the Hoosiers' minimalist look had become such a part of the program's brand that the proposal was dropped after considerable backlash from fans. Despite the long tradition behind the jerseys, they have undergone some slight changes over the years. The school's colors are cream and crimson, but in the 1970s Knight and football coach Lee Corso started using uniforms that were more scarlet or bright red. During the same time, cream gave way almost universally to white. But those colors reverted mostly to cream and crimson in the early 2000s, after then-athletics director Michael McNeely decided that the team uniforms needed to reflect the school's official colors of cream and crimson.\n\nWilliam Tell Overture\nDuring the third time-out of every second half, the Indiana Big Red Basketball Band performs the William Tell Overture with cheerleaders racing around the court carrying myriad flags that spell out \"Indiana Hoosiers.\" Indiana Assistant Director for Facilities, Chuck Crabb, said the tradition began in about 1979 or 1980. Sportscaster Billy Packer called it \"the greatest college timeout in the country.\"\n\n\"Mop Lady\" advertisement\nIn 1971, Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance became the sole sponsor of Indiana and Purdue games on WTTV.  During the mid-1970s, the ad featured Martha Webster, an Indianapolis-area opera singer, portraying a janitor sweeping the floors of Assembly Hall while whistling and singing the school's fight song, \"Indiana, Our Indiana.\"  \"Martha the Mop Lady\" introduced Indiana basketball broadcasts for 30 years. Upon Indiana's firing of Bob Knight, Farm Bureau pulled the ad. In 2009 new coach Tom Crean resurrected the tradition and had \"Martha\" appear at the \"Midnight Madness\" festivities to begin the season. Because Webster was unavailable, singer Sheila Stephen stepped in as the new Martha.  Starting with the 2010\u201311 season, video of the original ad was shown at home games after the National Anthem and right before tip off.  In recent years, the ad has been shown just before the Hoosiers take the court.\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1900\u20131924)\nIndiana fielded its first men's basketball team in the 1900\u201301 season, posting a 1\u20134 ledger under coach James H. Horne. In their first game the Hoosiers traveled to Indianapolis and lost to Butler 20\u201317. Indiana's first victory was a 26\u201317 win over Wabash College that same year.\nIn 1917 the Hoosiers began playing their games at the Men's Gymnasium. After the first few games there, spectators complained that they could not see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. Therefore, new backboards were installed that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass allowing fans to see games without an obstructed view. As a result, it was the first facility (thus the Hoosiers were the first team) in the country to use glass backboards.\n\nEverett Dean era (1924\u20131938)\nIU's first great head coach, Everett Dean, was at first a standout player who garnered IU's first All-America honors in 1921. In 1924, Dean signed on as the full-time head coach of his alma mater. Under Dean, the Hoosiers would elevate their play to new heights, winning their first-ever share of the Big Ten Conference title in 1926, defeating Wisconsin 35\u201320. The Hoosiers also won conference championships in 1928 and 1936. Four All-Americans helped lead the Hoosiers in this era: Jim Strickland, Branch McCracken (later coach), Vern Huffman, and Ken Gunning. Dean coached Indiana until 1938. He is the only coach named to both the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and the College Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nBranch McCracken era (1938\u20131965)\nWhen Dean left for Stanford, the popular selection to succeed him was Branch McCracken. McCracken was another young alumnus and former player under Everett Dean. Because of his fast-breaking style of play, McCracken's teams would earn the nickname \"Hurryin' Hoosiers\".\nMcCracken's first IU team was led by All-American Ernie Andres, later a McCracken basketball assistant. In McCracken's first year, the team finished 17\u20133, splitting games with both Purdue and eventual NCAA runner-up Ohio State. The following year the 1939\u201340 NCAA title team, led by All-American Marvin Huffman, would take Indiana to unprecedented success: an NCAA title and a record (at the time) 20 wins. The 20\u20133 record by that team would not be bested for another 13 years until broken again by Indiana. At their home court at The Fieldhouse, Indiana saw six perfect seasons including a 24-game unbeaten home winning streak from 1938 to 1941. In 1948, McCracken was responsible for recruiting Bill Garrett who became the first African American player in Big Ten varsity basketball history.\n\nThe Hoosiers' 1952\u201353 NCAA title team \u2013 led by Bobby Leonard, Dick Farley, and three-time All-American Don Schlundt \u2013 won the Big Ten and went on to win the NCAA championship by defeating reigning champions Kansas by one point. The Hoosiers would again win the Big Ten the following season in 1953\u201354. Just a few years later the team won back-to-back conference championships in 1956\u201357 and 1957\u201358 behind the leadership of two-time All-American Archie Dees. A few years later the Hoosiers were led by two-time All-American Walt Bellamy, one of the few African-American players in college basketball at the time.\nIn the fall of 1960 the Indiana Hoosiers football program was hit with devastating NCAA sanctions that impacted every varsity sport at the school, including basketball. Although the violations only occurred within the football program, all Hoosier varsity sports were barred from postseason play during the probationary period. The sanctions drastically undermined the ability of coaches to lure talented players to Indiana. Nevertheless, McCracken did manage to successfully recruit twins Dick Van Arsdale and Tom Van Arsdale, both of whom would earn All-America honors in 1965.\nMcCracken ultimately coached IU for 23 years, amassing 364 wins and 210 Big Ten wins. His teams also won four regular season Big Ten titles and went to the NCAA tournament four times, winning two national titles. He was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame and the court now at Assembly Hall is named in his honor.\n\nLou Watson era (1965\u20131971)\nSandwiched between two iconic coaches in Branch McCracken and Bob Knight, McCracken's longtime assistant and former lead scorer Lou Watson coached Indiana from 1965 through 1971, with a leave of absence in 1970 where Jerry Oliver stepped in as acting head coach. The 1966\u201367 team, which won a Big Ten championship, was known as the \"Cardiac Kids\" because of their many heart-stopping finishes. During the 1970\u20131971 season the Hoosiers were led by All-American George McGinnis. Watson ended his Indiana coaching career with a 61\u201360 record.\n\nBob Knight era (1971\u20132000)\nDuring Bob Knight's 29 years as head coach at Indiana, the Hoosiers won 662 games, including 22 seasons of 20 or more wins, while losing but 239, a remarkable .735 winning percentage. In 24 NCAA tournament appearances at Indiana, Hoosier teams under Bob Knight won 42 of 63 games (.667), winning titles in 1975\u201376, 1980\u201381, and 1986\u201387, while finishing third in 1973 and 1992. While at Indiana, a total of 23 different players under Coach Knight's tutelage received All-American and All-Big Ten honors. For 10-consecutive seasons, a player made the All-American Academic and All-Big Ten Academic Teams, and a total of 18 players were so honored. Nine Indiana players won 10 Big Ten Most Valuable Player honors.\nIn 1972\u201373, Knight's second year as coach, Indiana won the Big Ten championship and reached the Final Four, but lost to UCLA. The following season, 1973\u201374, Indiana once again captured a Big Ten title. In the two following seasons, 1974\u201375 and 1975\u201376, the Hoosiers were undefeated in the regular season and won 37-consecutive Big Ten games, including two more Big Ten championships. The 1974\u201375 Hoosiers swept the entire Big Ten by an average of 22.8 points per game. However, in an 83\u201382 win against Purdue they lost consensus All-American forward Scott May to a broken left arm. With May's injury keeping him to 7 minutes of play, the No. 1 Hoosiers lost to Kentucky 92\u201390 in the Mideast Regional. The Hoosiers were so dominant that four starters \u2013 Scott May, Steve Green, Kent Benson and Quinn Buckner \u2013 would make the five-man All-Big Ten team. The following season, 1975\u201376, the Hoosiers went the entire season and 1976 NCAA tournament without a single loss, beating Michigan 86\u201368 in the title game. Indiana remains the last school to accomplish this feat.\n\nBehind the play of Mike Woodson Indiana won the 1979 NIT championship. The 1979\u201380 Hoosiers, led by Woodson and Isiah Thomas, won the Big Ten championship and advanced to the 1980 Sweet Sixteen. The following season, in 1980\u201381, Thomas and the Hoosiers once again won a conference title and won the 1981 NCAA tournament, the school's fourth national title. In 1982\u20131983, with the strong play of Uwe Blab and All-Americans Ted Kitchel and Randy Wittman, the No. 1 ranked Hoosiers were favorites to win another national championship. However, with an injury to Kitchel mid-season, the Hoosiers' prospects were grim. Knight asked for fan support to rally around the team and, when the team ultimately won the Big Ten title, he ordered that a banner be hung for the team in Assembly Hall as a tribute to the fans, who he credited with inspiring the team to win its final three home games. Nevertheless, in the tournament Kitchel's absence was felt and the team lost to Kentucky in the 1983 Sweet Sixteen.\nThe 1985\u201386 Hoosiers were profiled in a best-selling book A Season on the Brink. To write it Knight granted author John Feinstein almost unprecedented access to the Indiana basketball program, as well as insights into Knight's private life. The following season, in 1986\u201387, the Hoosiers were led by All-American Steve Alford and captured a share of the Big Ten title. The team won Indiana's fifth national championship against Syracuse in the 1987 NCAA tournament with a game-winning jump shot by Keith Smart with five seconds of play remaining in the championship game. In the 1988\u20131989 season the Hoosiers were led by All-American Jay Edwards and won a Big Ten championship.\nFrom 1990 to 1991 through 1992\u201393, the Hoosiers posted 87 victories, the most by any Big Ten team in a three-year span, breaking the mark of 86 set by Knight's Indiana teams of 1974\u201376. Teams from these three seasons spent all but two of the 53 poll weeks in the top 10, and 38 of them in the top 5. They captured two Big Ten crowns in 1990\u201391 and 1992\u201393, and during the 1991\u201392 season reached the Final Four. During the 1992\u201393 season, the 31\u20134 Hoosiers finished the season at the top of the AP Poll, but were defeated by Kansas in the Elite Eight. Teams from this era included Greg Graham, Pat Knight, All-Americans Damon Bailey and Alan Henderson, and National Player of the Year Calbert Cheaney.\nThroughout the mid and late 1990s Knight and the Hoosiers continued to experience success with superior play from All-Americans Brian Evans and A. J. Guyton. The Hoosiers won a minimum of 19 games and played in the NCAA tournament each year. However, 1993 would be Knight's last conference championship and 1994 would be his last trip to the Sweet Sixteen. Moreover, his aggressive and combative actions and communication often brought as much controversy to the school as success. Allegations of abuse, along with his reputation and a strained relationship with then-University President Myles Brand, resulted in Knight's controversial dismissal in 2000.\n\nResurrection era (2000\u20132006)\nFollowing Bob Knight's tumultuous exit from Indiana, assistant Mike Davis took over as interim head coach in the fall of 2000. In his first season, Davis led a team featuring All-Americans Kirk Haston and Jared Jeffries to a 21\u201313 record. The following year, in the 2001\u201302 season, Davis was named the permanent coach. That year the Hoosiers captured a share of the Big Ten championship and made an unexpected trip to the 2002 NCAA championship game. But after the Hoosiers lost in 2002 and failed to make the NCAA tournament in 2004 and 2005 (for the first time since 1985), criticism of Davis grew. Following months of speculation, he announced his resignation in February 2006, saying the basketball program needed to move on with a new coach. He remained with the team for the rest of the 2006 season before leaving.\n\nKelvin Sampson era (2006\u20132008)\nOn March 28, 2006, Oklahoma head coach Kelvin Sampson was named coach of the Hoosiers, despite a history of violating NCAA rules and sanctions imposed on him. Sampson fielded competitive teams and scored a major recruiting victory by persuading in-state star Eric Gordon to sign with Indiana. The Hoosiers, with Gordon and forward D.J. White, were considered one of the better teams during the 2007\u20132008 season. However, in October 2007 Sampson was found to have violated rules again, this time by engaging in a 3-way phone conversation with a recruit. Indiana punished Sampson by denying him a previously scheduled $500,000 raise, firing one of his assistant coaches, and taking away one of his scholarships for the 2008\u20132009 season.\nIn early February 2008 the NCAA informed Indiana that Sampson had \"knowingly violated telephone recruiting restrictions and then lied about it.\" After launching another internal investigation, Indiana officials announced just 14 days later that Sampson accepted a $750,000 buyout of his contract and resigned as the men's basketball coach. Former player and assistant coach Dan Dakich was named interim coach for the remainder of the season. A number of college basketball pundits believed that Sampson's tenure at Indiana had effectively ended once the allegations broke. Sports Illustrated college basketball columnist Seth Davis noted that the NCAA had given Indiana 90 days to respond to the notice of allegations. Indiana officials said their internal investigation would only take a week, leading Davis to believe that they had already decided Sampson was guilty.  ESPN's Mark Schlabach suggested that the only reason Indiana did not fire Sampson right away was because his contract did not allow the school to suspend him immediately. He believed Indiana was trying to find a way not to honor his contract and stay out of the courtroom.  ESPN's Pat Forde said that Sampson's departure was \"preordained\" the moment the NCAA sent out its notice of allegations, and suggested that Sampson would never return to Division I.\nIn November 2008, the NCAA imposed a three-year probation on the basketball program and upheld the school's self-imposed sanctions stemming from the actions of Sampson and his staff. Earlier, IU president Michael McRobbie privately told the NCAA infractions committee that Sampson betrayed his trust as Indiana's coach, and demonstrated that his hiring had been \"a risk that should not have been taken.\"\n\nTom Crean era (2008\u20132017)\nOn April 1, 2008, Marquette head coach Tom Crean was hired as head coach and inherited a thoroughly depleted team. Between Crean's hiring and the start of the 2008\u201309 season, freshman Eric Gordon opted to leave early for the NBA and star forward DJ White graduated. Two other players transferred, one player was dismissed from the team and two others previously dismissed by Dakich were not allowed to return.  As a result, Crean began with a roster consisting of two walk-ons who had scored a combined 36 points in their careers. Crean's first three seasons saw losing records of 6\u201325 (the worst in school history), 10\u201321, and 12\u201320.\nThe 2011\u20132012 season was a watershed one for Crean and the program. The arrival of Indiana Mr. Basketball Cody Zeller brought higher expectations for year four. The team earned wins over the #1 ranked Kentucky, the #2 ranked Ohio State, and #5 ranked Michigan State. This made Indiana the first Big 10 program to knock off the #1 and #2 ranked teams in the same season since 1991 and the first IU squad ever to defeat three programs ranked in the top five in the regular season.  The Hoosiers finished the season with a 27\u20139 record, 5th in the Big Ten. The fifteen game win improvement in 2011\u20132012 was the largest single turnaround in the NCAA that season.  Crean's guidance of the program to success from \"unthinkable depths\" was regarded as one of the most remarkable rebuilding projects in NCAA basketball history. The Hoosiers advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the 2012 NCAA tournament before losing a rematch game to Kentucky, who would go on to win the national championship. Following the surprise run to the Sweet Sixteen, the 2012\u20132013 Hoosiers spent 10 weeks ranked No. 1 in the country, and all but two weeks in the top 5. The experience of Jordan Hulls and Christian Watford, alongside the talent of Victor Oladipo, Cody Zeller and freshman point guard Yogi Ferrell, led this team to a finish of outright Big Ten regular season champions for the first time since 2002. They again advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, the first time since the 1992\u201393 and 1993\u201394 seasons that the Hoosiers advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in back-to-back seasons. As national player of the year, Oladipo and Zeller both left for the NBA after the conclusion of the season.\nAfter a rough start, the 2015\u20132016 Hoosiers finished the season 27\u20138 overall and 15\u20133 in the Big Ten to win the Big Ten regular season title outright. They received the #1 seed in the 2016 Big Ten men's basketball tournament, where they made an early quarterfinals exit. As Big Ten Conference Champions, the Hoosiers received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and beat Chattanooga and Kentucky to advance to the Sweet 16 for the third time in five years; however, they fell to North Carolina in the next round. Despite the highs of the previous season and being ranked as high as #3 in the nation, the 2016\u20132017 team faced a troubling and disappointing year; they finished 18\u201316 overall and 7\u201311 in Big Ten play. After tying for tenth in the Big Ten, the Hoosiers missed out on the NCAA tournament and lost in the first round of the NIT, their first appearance since 2005. On March 16, 2017, the Indiana Hoosiers Athletic's Department fired coach Tom Crean. He ended his tenure with the Hoosiers with an overall record of 166\u2013135 (.551), three Sweet Sixteen appearances, and two regular season conference championships.\n\nArchie Miller era (2017\u20132021)\nOn March 27, 2017, Dayton head coach Archie Miller was named the 29th head coach in the history of the men's basketball program. Miller's first season was a major remodeling job, starting with laying the foundation of a pack-line defense and valuing possessions. Early in the season, Miller stated practices were 75% defense, 25% offense. That scheme showed early and often, as the Hoosiers struggled mightily throughout the season to find any flow or rhythm on offense, despite the defense making leaps and bounds in the overall rankings of Division 1 basketball. With a surprising early second round loss in the 2018 Big Ten tournament to Rutgers, 76\u201367, and losing enough games to keep them out of both the NCAA tournament and NIT, including games in which they were favored, such as Indiana State and Fort Wayne, IU's first season under their new coach came to a disappointing close. They finished with an overall record of 16\u201315 and 9\u20139 in the Big Ten.\nIn 2018, Miller landed his first five star recruit when Romeo Langford committed to Indiana University. Langford, a McDonald's-All American and 2018 Indiana Mr. Basketball, was (according to ESPN) the 6th ranked player in the nation and number one high school player in Indiana. Despite getting off to a strong start of 12\u20132, which included 3 conference wins, the 2018\u20132019 Hoosiers struggled down the backstretch of the season. Riddled with injuries and the inability to shoot, IU lost 12 of 13 games before turning things around and finishing the regular season with a 4-game winning streak. Having put themselves back into the conversation for making the NCAA tournament for the first time in 3 years, the Hoosiers looked to knock off Ohio State in the Big Ten tournament. However, the Hoosiers fell short and lost to Ohio State, 79\u201375. IU was deemed one of the Last Four Out in the NCAA tournament, so they earned 1-seed in the NIT, where they advanced to the Quarterfinals before losing to Wichita State, 73\u201363. Thus, the Hoosiers' 119th season ended with an overall record of 19\u201316 and 8\u201312 in the Big Ten. The Hoosiers started off another strong campaign for the 2019\u20132020 season by going 11\u20131 before dropping back-to-back games in late December 2019 and early January 2020. During the bulk of the conference season, IU was able to win most of their home games (7\u20133), while stealing a few road games (2\u20138) to end their final season with an overall record of 20\u201312 and a conference record of 9\u201311. Indiana entered the Big Ten tournament as the 11-seed where they faced the 14-seeded Nebraska Cornhuskers. The first round matchup ended in an 89\u201364 IU victory, staging a second round matchup with 6-seed Penn State. However, on the morning of March 12, 2020, the Big Ten Conference announced that it would be cancelling the remaining tournament games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following suit, that afternoon, the NCAA announced that it was cancelling all winter and spring championships. This announcement officially, and abruptly, ended the Hoosiers' season, where they were expected to make the NCAA tournament for the first time in 4 years.\nThe 2020\u201321 season was another disappointing one as the Hoosiers finished the regular season 12\u201315 overall, 7\u201312 in the Big Ten. Indiana closed out the season on a 6-game losing streak, leaving them out of the NCAA and NIT tournaments. On March 15, 2021, Indiana University officially parted ways with Miller and began its search for the next men's head basketball coach.\n\nMike Woodson era (2021\u20132025)\nJust shy of two weeks after Archie Miller was fired, Indiana University announced on March 28, 2021, that former Indiana standout Mike Woodson would become the 30th head coach of the IU basketball program. In addition, former Ohio State head coach, Thad Matta, was hired on to be an associate athletic director in men's basketball administration. This was Woodson's first coaching job in the college ranks, having previously served as head coach for the Atlanta Hawks and New York Knicks, serving as an assistant coach for the latter team when IU hired him.\nCoach Woodson's first season at the helm saw a list of streaks come to an end for the Hoosiers. Indiana finished the season 21\u201314 overall, and 9\u201311 in conference play. Along the way, IU ended losing streaks to Purdue, Michigan, and Illinois. as the No. 9 seed, they also advanced to the semifinals of the Big Ten Conference tournament, something they had not done since 2013. They lost to Iowa, 80\u201377, the eventual tournament champions. The Hoosiers also heard their name called on Selection Sunday for the first time since 2016. After a six-year absence from the NCAA tournament, IU was selected as a No. 12 seed to play in the NCAA tournament First Four round in Dayton, Ohio. They knocked off No. 12 seed Wyoming to make it to the first round (Round of 64) where they lost to No. 5 seed St. Mary's.\nThe Hoosiers finished the 2022\u201323 regular season ranked No. 19 in the Associated Press poll. The team spent 16 weeks among the top-25 teams in the nation. The Hoosiers also captured a share of 2nd place in the Big Ten Conference with a 21\u201310 overall regular season record, 12\u20138 in Big Ten play, and the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten Conference tournament. IU advanced to the quarterfinals before losing a close game to Penn State. For the second year in a row, the team found themselves in the NCAA Tournament this time as a No. 4 seed, where they improved upon their performance last year by making it to the Round of 32 but falling to the No. 5 seed Miami (FL), 85\u201369. Woodson's third season didn't meet expectations as the 2023\u201324 Hoosiers finished 19\u201314 overall and 10\u201310 in the Big Ten. IU received the No. 6 seed in the Big Ten Conference tournament, where they beat Penn State for the first time that season, 61\u201359 with a last second tip-in by Anthony Leal. In the quarterfinals, IU lost to Nebraska for the third time that season, 93\u201366.\nThe 2024\u201325 season ended up being Mike Woodson's final year as the head coach. On February 7, 2025, IU Athletics issued a statement confirming that Woodson would retire at the end of the season. For the second year in a row IU missed out on the 2025 NCAA Tournament. Turning down other post-season tournament invites, the Hoosiers finished with an overall record of 19\u201313 and 10\u201310 in Big Ten Conference play. Thus finishing the 4-year Mike Woodson era.\n\nDarian DeVries era (2025\u2013present)\nOn March 18, 2025, West Virginia head coach Darian DeVries was hired as the 31st head coach of the IU program.\n\nSeason-by-season records\nCurrent Roster\nFacilities\nOld Assembly Hall (1900\u20131917)\nIndiana's first basketball home was the original Assembly Hall, and at the time it was known simply as the Men's Gymnasium. As a multi-purpose building it also hosted a number of other indoor sports and campus activities. The wood-frame structure was built in 1896 at a cost of $12,000 and had a seating capacity of 600, though many more would often pack inside to watch games. It was located on the east side of Owen Hall where a small Disabled Zone parking lot sits today on the south side of the Indiana Memorial Union building. The first basketball game was played on February 21, 1901, when Indiana lost to Butler 24\u201320. In March 1911 the gym hosted the first ever Indiana high school basketball tournament and was hosted by the IU Booster Club instead of the IHSAA. As basketball began to outgrow the facility, students went so far as to characterize the gym as a public menace and health risk. On January 13, 1917, Indiana played its final game in the gym with a win over Iowa State 29\u201313. The building was torn down in 1938.\n\nMen's Gymnasium (1917\u20131928)\nThe Men's Gymnasium served as the home of the basketball team from 1917 to 1928. After the first few games spectators complained that they could not see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. As a result, the Nurre Mirror Plate Company in Bloomington was employed to create new backboards that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. As a result, it was the first facility in the country to use glass backboards. Due to growing popularity of the sport at the school the team eventually had to move to a larger arena. The facility is now used by the School of Public Health-Bloomington (formerly the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, HPER).\n\nIU Fieldhouse (1928\u20131960)\nThe IU Fieldhouse (now known as the William Leon Garrett Fieldhouse, named after Bill Garrett) hosted the basketball team from 1928 to 1960. Indiana star player (and later coach) Branch McCracken scored the first point in the facility with a free throw. During the team's 32 seasons there, it hosted two national championship teams, five conference titles, 20 different All-Americans, and three Big Ten Most Valuable Players. However, the growing popularity of the sport necessitated a move to a new facility.\n\nNew IU Fieldhouse (1960\u20131971)\nThe New IU Fieldhouse (later named the Gladstein Fieldhouse) was originally intended as an interim home for the men's basketball team. However, NCAA sanctions on the football program hobbled the school's finances, and the \"New\" Fieldhouse ended up hosting the team for 11 years from 1960 to 1971. It now serves as a state-of-the-art track and field facility.\n\nSimon Skjodt Assembly Hall (1971\u2013present)\nThe Hoosiers currently play at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall (pronounced like Scott).  The 17,222-seat arena has been the home of the men's basketball team since 1972. The basketball floor is named Branch McCracken Court after the legendary Hoosier coach. The north end of the arena prominently displays the program's five national championship banners. Former head coach Bob Knight called the facility a \"sacred place\" for student fans and athletes. Basketball sportscaster Gus Johnson called Assembly Hall, \"the Carnegie Hall of basketball.\"\n\nCook Hall (2010\u2013present)\nCook Hall is a basketball practice facility that was completed in 2010 and is located next to Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall, connected by a tunnel.  Bill and Gayle Cook donated $15 million to the \"For the Glory of Old IU\" campaign, out of which came Cook Hall where the IU basketball team is able to engage in day-to-day operations. It contains the Pfau Shine Legacy Court, a museum space that chronicles the history of Indiana basketball with photographs, artifacts, trophies and interactive touch-screen kiosks. The 67,000-square-foot, three story facility features two practice courts, two locker rooms, two player lounges, a strength and conditioning area, coaches' offices, and meeting rooms.\n\nCoaching history\nNotable players and coaches\nIndiana does not retire numbers of former players, unlike many other college basketball programs.\n\n1,000-point scorers\nThe Hoosiers currently have 56 players in their 1,000-point club.\nCalbert Cheaney is the all-time leading scorer at Indiana University with 2,613 points. Cheaney was able to reach the 1,000-point milestone in just 53 games, the 4th quickest Hoosier to do so. Others of honorable mention include Don Schlundt (43 games), Archie Dees (47 games), Walt Bellamy (50 games), Mike Woodson and Jimmy Rayl (54 games), Joe Cooke and Jay Edwards (55 games), Bracey Wright (59 games), and rounding out the top 10 is Tom Bolyard (60 games).\n\nNational Players of the Year\nKent Benson \u2013 1976 (Helms Foundation)\nScott May \u2013 1976 (Naismith, Helms Foundation, Sporting News, NABC, Associated Press, UPI)\nCalbert Cheaney \u2013 1993 (Wooden, Naismith, Sporting News, Oscar Robertson, NABC, Associated Press, UPI)\nVictor Oladipo \u2013 2013 (Sporting News)\n\nAll-Americans\nIndiana has a total of 46 players who have claimed All-American status, with 14 of them earning First-Team All-American.\n\n\u2666 Denotes Consensus First-Team All-American\n\nAcademic All-Americans\nA total of 11 Hoosiers have been deemed Academic All-Americans.\n\nMcDonald's All-Americans\nIndiana has recruited a total of 34 McDonald's All-Americans; the first coming in 1977 and the latest in 2024.\n\nIndiana Mr. Basketball\n29 Indiana Mr. Basketball honorees have played for Indiana.\n\nCoaching honors\nNational Coach of the Year\n\nBig Ten Coach of the Year\n\nBig Ten Conference honors\nBig Ten Player of the Year\n\nBig Ten Freshman of the Year\n\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famers\nBranch McCracken, inducted in 1960 as a player\nEverett Dean, inducted in 1966 as a coach\nBob Knight, inducted in 1991 as a coach\nWalt Bellamy, inducted in 1993 as a player\nIsiah Thomas, inducted in 2000 as a player\nBobby \"Slick\" Leonard, inducted in 2014 as a coach\nGeorge McGinnis, inducted in 2017 as a player\n\nNational Collegiate Basketball Hall of Famers\nEverett Dean, inducted in 2006 as a coach\nBranch McCracken, inducted in 2006 as a player\nBob Knight, inducted in 2006 as a coach\nIsiah Thomas, inducted in 2006 as a player\nWalt Bellamy, inducted in 2006 as a player\nQuinn Buckner, inducted in 2015 as a player\nScott May, inducted in 2017 as a player\nCalbert Cheaney, inducted in 2019 as a player\n1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team, inducted in 2020 as a team\n\nCurrent NBA players\nEric Gordon (Philadelphia 76ers)\nThomas Bryant (Cleveland Cavaliers)\nO.G.

The Hoosiers' five NCAA Championships are tied with Duke (5) for the fourth-most in history, trailing only UCLA (11), Kentucky (8), North Carolina and UConn (6). Their eight trips to the Final Four ranks eighth (tied) on the all-time list. The Hoosiers have made 41 appearances in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament (sixth-most in NCAA history).  In those 41 appearances, Indiana has posted a 68\u201336 record (.654).  Its 68 victories are the seventh-most in NCAA history. The Hoosiers also won post-season tournaments in 1974, the Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournament, and in 1979, the National Invitation Tournament.

Their first taste of success came with the ECAC men's basketball tournaments (essentially regional tournaments played by Division I schools that were essentially independent, with Iona being in the Metro) in 1979 and 1980, winning the two years for an autobid to the NCAA Tournament. \nIona is also one of the founding members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, which began play in men's basketball with the 1981\u201382 season, having been passed over by the Big East Conference for Seton Hall in 1980. The Gaels have compiled the most victories of any MAAC team since the founding of the conference and have won a league record fourteen MAAC tourney titles (1982, 1984, 1985, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2006, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2023).  They have appeared in the NCAA tournament in 1979, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2006, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2023, with the first two of those appearances coming as a member of the Metropolitan Conference and in 2012 as an at-large selection out of the MAAC. The Gaels have also been to 7 NITs, in 1982, 1983, 1996, 1997, 2014, 2015 and 2022.  In 2011, the Gaels made it to the final game of the CIT post-season tournament, losing at home to Santa Clara. Since the 1978-79 season, the Gaels have won 20 games or more in 23 seasons.\n\nNotable coaches with Iona W/L record\nJim McDermott 325\u2013252\nJim Valvano 95\u201346\nPat Kennedy 124\u201360\nTim Welsh 70\u201322\nJeff Ruland 139\u2013135\nKevin Willard 45\u201349\nTim Cluess 199\u2013108\nRick Pitino 64\u201322\nTobin Anderson 33\u201334\n\nPostseason\nNCAA Tournament Results\nThe Gaels have appeared in 16 NCAA Tournaments.

Iona's only NCAA Tournament victory to date, which took place in 1980, was vacated by the NCAA due to their star center, Jeff Ruland, having signed a contract with an agent for professional representation a few months prior. Thus, NCAA record books attribute to them an 0\u201316 record in NCAA tournament games.

    "biography": "The Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team is part of the University of Iowa athletics department.\nThe Hawkeyes have had eight National Invitation Tournament appearances, won eight Big Ten regular-season conference championships and won the Big Ten tournament three times. Iowa has played in 29 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournaments and advanced to the Final Four on three occasions, reaching the semifinals in 1955 and 1980 and playing in the championship game against the University of San Francisco in 1956.\nIowa basketball was widely successful in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with a program resurgence under Lute Olson and the tenures of George Raveling and Tom Davis. Under Olson, the Hawkeyes won their last Big Ten regular season championship and went to the 1980 Final Four.\nThey currently play in 15,400-seat Carver\u2013Hawkeye Arena, along with Iowa women's basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams.\nPrior to playing in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, which opened in 1983, the Hawkeyes played in the Iowa Armory and the Iowa Field House, which is still used today by the school's gymnastics teams. In 2006, the Hawkeyes accumulated a school-record 21 consecutive wins at home before losing to in-state rival Northern Iowa.\nThree Iowa head coaches have been inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches: Sam Barry, Ralph Miller, and Lute Olson. A fourth Hawkeyes head coach, George Raveling, is a member in the Hall's contributor category.\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1901\u20131922)\nThe roots of Iowa basketball lie in 1901, when Ed Rule coached the Hawkeyes to a 10\u20132 record in their very first season of varsity basketball. Earlier, when the sport was evolving and still in a club format, Iowa played the University of Chicago club in the first five-on-five college game on January 18, 1896. Rule coached the Hawkeyes in four non-consecutive seasons (1901\u201302, 03\u201304, 05\u201307), leading Iowa to a 37\u201315 record under his watch. Even today, Rule's winning percentage stands as the best among head coaches in Iowa basketball history.\n\nAside from Rule's tenure, the Hawkeyes were coached by: Fred Bailey (1902\u20131903), John Chalmers (1904\u20131905), John Griffith (1907\u20131910), Walter Stewart (1910\u20131912), Floyd Thomas (1912\u20131913), Maury Kent (1913\u20131918), Edwin Bannick (1918\u20131919), and James Ashmore (1919\u20131922). In the era of multiple sport coaches, Chalmers (24\u20138), Griffin (2\u20134), Kent (assistant) and Ashmore (assistant) also were Coaches of Iowa Hawkeyes football. Kent pitched briefly for the Brooklyn Dodgers and coached the Iowa Hawkeyes baseball team (42\u201326), as did Chalmers (24\u20136), Stewart (16\u201312), Ashmore (23\u201320) and Griffith (9\u20136). From 1902 to 1923, the best Iowa basketball finished in conference play was fifth on three separate occasions. Iowa began play in the Western Conference (1902\u20131917) which evolved and changed its name to the Big Ten Conference beginning in 1917\u20131918.\n\nSam Barry era (1922\u20131929)\nIn 1922, Sam Barry was hired as Iowa's 10th head coach. In Barry's first season, 1923, Iowa went 13\u20132 overall and won the Big Ten championship for the first time in school history. The winning did not stop there: the Hawkeyes also tied for the Big Ten championship in 1926, along with Indiana, Michigan, and Purdue. Barry also coached the Iowa Hawkeyes baseball team, going 19\u201315 from 1923 to 1924. Before Barry continued his Hall of Fame career at the USC in 1929, he authored a handbook on the sport, Basketball: Individual Play and Team Play, featuring Iowa players and facilities. 62\u201354 at Iowa, Barry remained at USC until his premature death in 1950 at age 57. Barry was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nRollie Williams era (1929\u20131942)\nFollowing Barry in the line of Hawkeye coaches was Rollie Williams, who would coach Iowa on two occasions, from 1929 to 1942 and in 1951. Williams' winning percentage of 51.5% (139\u2013131), and his long tenure at Iowa allowed him to become the winningest coach in Iowa history until Lute Olson, Tom Davis and Fran McCaffery surpassed him.\nEarly during Williams' head coaching tenure, in 1929, Iowa's teams were suspended from participation in the Big Ten for violating conference rules. After a Big Ten investigation uncovered an illegal slush fund and possible recruiting violations, Iowa relented to the Big Ten's demands and was eventually reinstated into the conference on February 1, 1930. Fourteen players, including four on the basketball squad, were declared ineligible as a result of the Big Ten's findings.\nNile Kinnick, the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner for Iowa Hawkeyes football, also played basketball at Iowa. Starting for Coach Williams in 1937\u201338 as a sophomore, Kinnick finished 2nd on the team and 15th in Big Ten scoring with 75 total points (6.3 points per game) that season, his only hoops season.\nWilliams left the Hawkeyes in 1942 during World War II to enter military service in the Navy. He would return to Iowa after his tour of duty and coached one final season in 1950\u201351, after illness had forced Pop Harrison away from the sideline the previous season.\nOverall Williams had a 42-year tenure at the University of Iowa (1924 to 1966), working in various coaching capacities and moving into athletic administration at Iowa after his coaching career.\n\nPops Harrison era (1942\u20131950)\nJust as the country emerged from the depression, so did Iowa's basketball fortunes. Following a rocky 7\u201310 season in 1943, Pops Harrison led the Hawkeyes to their third overall Big Ten title (and first unshared title) in 1945.\nMurray Weir was the centerpiece of Pops Harrison's teams from 1944 to 1948, as Wier was a starter in all four-year season, playing under coach Harrison and developed into a prolific scorer, leading the NCAA in scoring. In 1944\u201345, the Hawkeyes won the Big Ten Conference season championship. The Hawkeyes finished second to the Michigan Wolverines in the Big Ten during Weir's his senior season of 1947\u201348.\n\nWier led the Hawkeyes in scoring in 1946\u201347 and 1947\u201348 with 15.1 and 21.0 points per game. Weir's 21.0 ppg led the NCAA in scoring in 1947\u20131948, with Wier becoming the first officially recognized Major College division scoring leader. Weir was a first team all\u2013Big Ten selection and was selected as the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player. Weir was named a 1948 consensus first team All-American.\nIn the following decade, from 1946 to 1956, the Hawkeyes had but one non\u2013winning season in 1948\u201349, Harrison's last full season as head coach. Illness forced Harrison miss a good portion of the 1949\u201350 season, coaching in 11 games.\n\nBucky O'Connor era (1949\u20131958)\nAfter playing and graduating from Drake University, O'Connor first came to Iowa from Boone Junior College in Boone, Iowa. He began at Iowa as the freshman basketball coach and Head Golf Coach in 1948. In 1950, O'Connor took over after the first two coaches of the 1949\u201350 season stepped down. He became the official coach in the 1951\u201352 season. Following short tenures by O'Connor in 1950 and Rollie Williams (with O'Connor assisting) for the entire 1950\u201351 season, in subbing for the ill Pops Harrison, O'Connor became Iowa's permanent coach in 1951. O'Connor would hold that position and achieve great success, until his death on April 22, 1958.\nChuck Darling was an early prominent player under O'Connor. Darling was a Consensus first\u2013team All-American in (1952), along with being named 1952 First\u2013team All-Big Ten. Darling was the 1st Round pick (#8 overall) of the Rochester Royals in the 1952 NBA draft. He played instead for the AAU Phillips 66ers in order to remain an amateur. He later played in the 1956 Olympics.\n\nThe Fabulous Five / back to back Final Fours\nIn 1952\u201353, Iowa finished second in the Big Ten behind the efforts of a starting lineup fully composed of sophomores nicknamed the \"Fabulous Five:\"Sharm Scheuerman, Bill Seaberg, Carl Cain, Bill Schoof, and Bill Logan.\nAs juniors in 1954\u201355, Iowa, with the \"Fabulous Five\" won the Big Ten outright and eventually finished fourth in the nation. Iowa advanced to the Final Four of the 1955 NCAA tournament, defeating Penn State 82\u201353 and Marquette 86\u201381 to advance.\nIn 1955\u201356, as seniors, Iowa again won the Big Ten outright and advanced to the Final Four of the 1956 NCAA tournament. They defeated Morehead State 97\u201383 and Kentucky and Coach Adolph Rupp 89\u201377 to advance to the Final Four. There, they defeated Temple 83\u201376 to advance to the national championship game. In the championship game, Iowa lost to the undefeated defending national champions \u2014 the Bill Russell-led San Francisco Dons by a score of 83\u201371. To date, it remains the only national championship game appearance by the Hawkeyes.\nDespite losing in the championship game, for the only time in school history, the Hawkeyes recorded consecutive Big Ten championships. Scheuerman, Seaberg, Cain, Schoof, and Logan, all members of the \"Fabulous Five\", had their jerseys retired in 1980.\n\n1956 USA Basketball Olympians\nChuck Darling and Carl Cain were members of the 1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Hall of famers Bill Russell and KC Jones were fellow team members. Darling averaged 9.3 points per game in the Olympics.\n\nO'Connor's death\nOn April 22, 1958, at the age of 44, O'Connor died in a car accident near Waterloo, Iowa, killed in a collision with a truck on Highway 218. O'Connor, who had once coached Iowa's Golf team, was on his way to Waterloo to play golf before a speaking engagement with the Sports of Sorts Club in Waterloo.\n\nIncludes Second Half of 1949\u201350 Season\n\nSharm Scheuerman era (1958\u20131964)\nAfter graduating from Iowa, Scheuerman had been hired as an assistant coach under Bucky O'Connor. Scheuerman was hired as head coach in 1958 after O'Connor was killed. At age 24, Scheuerman became the youngest head basketball coach in Big Ten Conference history. In six years as the Hawkeyes' head coach, Scheuerman's teams compiled a record of 72\u201369. Bob King was an assistant under Scheuerman from 1960 to 1962. Scheuerman resigned after the 1963\u20131964 season and entered private business. He later became an announcer for Iowa telecasts.\n\nA two-time All-American at Iowa, Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee and 5 x NBA Champion and Coach, Don Nelson, played for Iowa and Coach Scheuerman from 1959 to 1962. Nelson has the most wins as a coach in NBA history and his #19 is retired by the Boston Celtics.\n\nScheuerman recruited Naismith Hall of Fame player Connie Hawkins to Iowa in 1960. After enrolling at Iowa as a freshman, Hawkins was named in an investigation into gambling and point-shaving in his native New York City. Hawkins had borrowed and repaid $200 from former NBA player Jack Molinas and was questioned by the FBI without legal representation. He was banned and never played collegiately again, before embarking on a professional career. He eventually sued the NBA who had banned him, winning a $1.6 million settlement and reinstatement. Hawkins' #42 was retired by the Phoenix Suns.\n\nRalph Miller era (1964\u20131970)\nIowa enjoyed 5 years of success under Ralph Miller from 1965 to 1966 through 1969\u201370, winning two Big Ten conference titles during that span. Miller joined the Hawks as head coach after completing a successful stint as head coach at Wichita State.\nThe 1967\u201368 team tied for the Big Ten Title with Ohio State with a 10\u20134 conference record, and a 16\u20139 overall record. This team was led by Sam Williams, a high-scoring forward who led the Big Ten in scoring that year.\nThe 1969\u201370 team was arguably the greatest team in Iowa basketball history. Known as the \"Six-Pack\" (because only 6 players played most of the minutes), this team stormed through the Big Ten with a perfect 14\u20130 record, one of the few Big Ten teams ever to go undefeated in the conference. The team averaged over 100 points in conference play, highlighted by a 108\u2013107 victory in West Lafayette over Purdue late in the season to clinch the outright title. Rick Mount of Purdue scored 61 points in that game in a losing effort.\n\nThe Six-Pack team was led by John Johnson and \"Downtown\" Fred Brown, who both enjoyed long and successful NBA careers after playing for the Hawkeyes,  Johnson was the 1st round pick (#7) overall of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1970 NBA draft. Glenn \"the Stick\" Vidnovic and Chad Calabria also were Six-pack members. Iowa averaged almost 80% accuracy as a team from the free throw line for the season.\nMiller left Iowa after the 1969\u201370 season to accept the head coaching job at Oregon State, where he coached until 1989. Miller was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nDick Schultz era (1970\u20131974)\nMiller and Scheuerman's assistant (and Iowa's baseball coach), Dick Schultz, succeeded Miller as head coach in 1970. A dual coach, Schultz had previously coached the Iowa Hawkeyes baseball team, going 129\u2013106 from 1963 to 1970. Schultz was 41\u201355 overall during his four-year run as coach, with \"Downtown\" Freddie Brown and Kevin Kunnert becoming First Round NBA Draft Picks.\nBrown was the 1st round pick (#6 overall) of the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1971 NBA draft and Kunnert was the 1st round pick (#12 overall) of the Chicago Bulls in 1973 NBA draft.\nSchultz resigned in 1974, after four second-division finishes in the Big Ten and a 41\u201355 overall record. Schultz later became the executive director of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) from 1988 to 1993. He then became executive director of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) from 1995 to 2000.\n\nLute Olson era (1974\u20131983)\nIowa hired Long Beach State coach Lute Olson to replace Schultz in 1974. After progressive improvements from 1975 to 1977, Olson coached the Hawkeyes to five consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1979 to 1983. \nThe 1978\u201379 squad earned a share the Big Ten Title.\n\n1980 Final Four\nOlson's tenure was highlighted by an appearance in the Final Four in 1980 on a team led by Ronnie Lester, with a supporting cast of Kenny Arnold, Steve Waite, Steve Krafcisin, Vince Brookins, Kevin Boyle, Bobby Hanson, and Mark Gannon. Iowa started 7\u20130 on the season when Lester was injured early in the season at Dayton, not returning until the regular season finale.\nNineteen regular season wins earned Iowa a No. 5 seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament (then, a 48-team field). In the four tournament wins that took Iowa to the Final Four, All-American Lester dished out 26 assists while committing only seven turnovers along with 51 points. Iowa opened by defeating Virginia Commonwealth 86\u201372 and No. 4 seed NC State 77\u201364. In a huge upset, Iowa knocked off No. 1 seed Syracuse 88\u201377, setting up a matchup in the Elite Eight with No. 3 Georgetown. Iowa earned an improbable Final Four trip to Indianapolis on March 16, 1980, defeating John Thompson's Georgetown squad 81\u201380. Iowa overcame a 10-point halftime deficit, making 17 of their final 21 shots and going 15\u201315 from the free-throw line. The winning basket was Steve Waite's three-point play in the closing seconds.\nIn the semi-final game against Denny Crum's Louisville team, Lester scored the first 10 points for Iowa. But after eight minutes of play he reinjured his knee and exited the game, ending his Iowa career. In Lester's absence, Louisville bested Iowa by only eight points, 80\u201372 and went on to win the Tournament, defeating UCLA, led by Larry Brown, in the final. Lester's value to his team was evident in the numbers. Not counting the Louisville game, they were 15\u20131 with Lester and 8\u20139 without him. Hall of Famer Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, who played two seasons at Michigan State, once claimed Lester the toughest opponent he ever faced in the Big Ten. Lester was drafted 10th overall in the 1980 NBA draft, but the knee issues limited him in the NBA. He donated $100,000 to the University of Iowa in 2009.\n\nCareer at Iowa\nAfter Olson coached the Hawkeyes to the 1980 Final Four, Iowa made the next three NCAA Tournaments. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the 1983 NCAA tournament, his final season at Iowa. Then nicknamed \"The House That Lute Built\", Carver-Hawkeye Arena opened on January 5, 1983, replacing the Iowa Field House. After the 1982\u20131983 season, Olson left Iowa for the University of Arizona. Olson was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nGeorge Raveling era (1983\u20131986)\nWhen Lute Olson left for Arizona, George Raveling came to Iowa from Washington State, where he coached from 1972 to 1983. Raveling immediately recruited Michigan high school stars B. J. Armstrong, Bill Jones, and Roy Marble, Springfield, Illinois' Lanphier High School teammates Ed Horton and Kevin Gamble, as well as USC transfer Gerry Wright, and Les Jepsen, all of whom would go on to play in the NBA. During Raveling's three years with the Iowa program, the Hawkeyes made two trips to the NCAA Tournament, after his first Iowa team finished 13\u201315. Like Sam Barry decades before, Raveling left Iowa (after the 1985\u201386 season) to take the head coaching position at the University of Southern California after compiling a record of 55\u201338 at Iowa. Raveling was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nTom Davis era (1986\u20131999)\nDr. Tom Davis was hired after George Raveling departed. Davis coached the Hawkeyes for 13 seasons from 1986\u201387 to 1998\u201399. Davis had coached Lafayette (1971\u20131977), Boston College (1977\u20131982) and Stanford (1982\u20131986) prior to Iowa. Davis is Iowa's all time victory leader with 269 wins.\nDavis utilized a full court press defense and rapid continuous substitution. In 1986\u20131987, the Hawkeyes won their first 18 games and obtained the No. 1 ranking in the AP and UPI polls for the first time in school history. Iowa, with future NBA players Brad Lohaus, B. J. Armstrong, Ed Horton, Kevin Gamble, Bill Jones and Roy Marble, along with Jeff Moe won a school-record 30 games. Iowa finished 14\u20134 in the Big Ten and advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament.\nIn the 1987 NCAA tournament #2 seed Iowa defeated Santa Clara 96\u201376, UTEP 84\u201382 and Oklahoma 93\u201391 to advance to the Elite Eight. In the Western Regional Final Iowa lost to #1 seed UNLV 84\u201381 after having a 16-point halftime lead. Kevin Gamble, who had hit the winning shot against the University of Oklahoma to send the Hawkeyes to the Elite Eight, shot a 3\u2013pointer as time expired, but the shot bounced off the rim.\nRetaining B. J. Armstrong, Ed Horton, Bill Jones and Roy Marble, the Hawkeyes began the 1987\u201388 season ranked in the top five by most polls and publications. Iowa advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, avenging their loss to UNLV in the Second Round 106\u201389, before losing 99\u201379 to former coach Lute Olson's Arizona Wildcats.\nOn January 16, 1993, Iowa player Chris Street, a junior averaging 14.5 points and 9.5 rebounds on Iowa's 12\u20132 team, was killed in an accident with a snow plow in Iowa City. His # 40 was retired by Iowa.\nIn all, Davis led the Hawkeyes to nine NCAA Tournaments, winning every First Round game in the process. In his final season, Iowa advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to eventual National Champion UConn. Under Davis the Hawkeyes also made two appearances in the National Invitational Tournament. He is the all\u2013time winningest coach in Iowa history with 269 wins. He would later come out of retirement to rebuild the Drake University program before being succeeded at Drake by his son Keno Davis.\n\nSteve Alford era (1999\u20132007)\nSteve Alford, a former All-American as an Indiana Hoosier and a member of the Olympic gold-winning 1984 United States basketball team, arrived at Iowa after coaching Southwest Missouri State University to the 1999 NCAA Tournament Sweet 16. In his first game as coach of the Hawkeyes, Iowa defeated the defending national champion and No. 1-ranked Connecticut Huskies in Madison Square Garden. Iowa finished 14\u201316.\nDuring his second year (2000\u201301) the Hawkeyes' roster included Indiana transfer Luke Recker and Reggie Evans, who would lead the Big Ten Conference in rebounds and double-doubles during his two seasons with Iowa, as well as Iowa Mr. basketball 1997 Dean Oliver. However, after a knee injury sidelined Recker, the Hawkeyes dropped six of their last seven conference games, finishing 23\u201312 for the regular season and 7\u20139 in the Big Ten Conference regular season. Despite the setback, they battled back and won the Big Ten Conference tournament with four straight wins against Northwestern, Ohio State, Penn State, and Indiana. This earned them a #7 seed in the 2001 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Creighton in the first round but lost to Kentucky in the second round.\nThe Hawkeyes' conference record dropped to 5\u201311 during the 2001\u201302 season, but they defeated Purdue, Wisconsin, and Indiana in the Big Ten tournament before losing to Ohio State in the finals. The Hawkeyes played in the 2002 National Invitation Tournament, losing to LSU in the first round to finish with a 19\u201316 record. This was the first of three straight seasons that the Hawkeyes played in the NIT under Alford.\nIowa won the first two rounds of the 2003 tournament against Valparaiso and Iowa State before losing to Georgia Tech, finishing with a 17\u201314 record. In 2004, they returned to the NIT, losing to St. Louis in the first round to complete the season at 16\u201313. Their 9\u20137 conference record marked the first winning Big Ten Conference record under Alford.\nThe Hawkeyes finished 21\u201312 with a 7\u20139 conference record in the 2004\u201305 regular season. They won their first two Big Ten tournament games against Purdue and Michigan State before losing the third game to Wisconsin, 59\u201356. They earned an at-large invitation to the 2005 NCAA tournament as a #10 seed, where they lost 76\u201364 to Cincinnati in the first round. During the season, leading scorer Pierre Pierce was dismissed from the team amid charges of sexual abuse; Pierce ultimately served one year in prison.\nDuring the 2005\u201306 season, the Hawkeyes went undefeated at Carver-Hawkeye Arena for the first time in school history and finished in a second-place tie with Illinois with an 11\u20135 conference record, one game behind Ohio State. However, the Hawkeyes defeated Minnesota, Michigan State, and Ohio State to win the Big Ten tournament and finish 25\u20138 going into its third NCAA Tournament under Alford. They were ranked No. 11 nationally and seeded #3 in the Atlanta Regional of the 2006 NCAA tournament, but lost in a first-round upset to #14 seed Northwestern State 64\u201363, leaving Alford with only one NCAA Tournament win since taking over at Iowa. The game was lost on a last-second shot, and the Hawkeyes would not return to the Round of 64 in the NCAA Tournament until 2014\u201315.\nDuring the 2006\u201307 season, Alford led the Hawkeyes to an 8\u20136 non-conference record (which included a home loss to Drake for the first time in 40 years) and a 9\u20137 record in the Big Ten Conference. Iowa was not invited to the post-season, marking the first time since the 1976\u201377 season that a Hawkeye team with a winning record (17\u201314) failed to make either the NCAA Tournament or the NIT.\nAt the conclusion of the 2006\u201307 season, Alford resigned from the University of Iowa to accept the coaching position at the University of New Mexico.\n\nTodd Lickliter era (2007\u20132010)\nFollowing Alford's departure, Butler coach and reigning NABC Coach of the Year Todd Lickliter was hired. The graduation of Adam Haluska and the transfer of leading scorer Tyler Smith to Tennessee created a void. The 2007\u20132008 Hawkeyes would finish 13\u201319 for the season, including 6\u201312 in the Big Ten. The 2008\u201309 Hawkeyes would improve slightly to 15\u201317. The 2009\u201310 Hawkeyes dropped to 10\u201322. After experiencing the worst three-year run in the program's history, Lickliter was fired on March 15, 2010.\n\nFran McCaffery era (2010\u20132025)\nCoach Fran McCaffery came to Iowa from Siena in 2010. In his 23rd season as a head coach at Iowa, Lehigh (1985\u20131988), UNC-Greensboro (1999\u20132005) and Siena (2005\u20132010), McCaffery has a career record of 424\u2013308 (.583).\nIowa's attendance increased by 20 percent from the previous year. McCaffery guided Iowa to two victories over top\u201350 RPI teams, including sixth\u2013ranked Purdue.\nIn 2012 the Hawkeyes were 4\u20133 against teams ranked in the AP top 25. For the second consecutive year, the Iowa Men's Basketball program saw a marked uptick in attendance inside Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Iowa's average attendance for all home games for the 2011\u201312 season was 11,841, the conference-only attendance was 13,254 per game.\nDuring the 2012\u20132013 season Iowa finished the regular season with a 20\u201311 record, including an 11\u20132 non conference and 9\u20139 conference record. Coach McCaffery also earned his 300th career win as a head coach on March 9, 2013, with a 74\u201360 win over Nebraska. In postseason play they defeated Northwestern in the Big Ten tournament before falling to the #3 seeded Michigan State Spartans in the second round. The Hawkeyes went on to earn a #3 seed in the 2013 NIT tournament where they would go advance to the championship game for the first time in school history before losing to Baylor (74\u201354). Iowa's 25 win total was the most by the team since setting the same mark in the 2005\u20132006 season.\nDuring the 2013\u20132014 season, Iowa achieved a non-conference record of 11\u20132, including a runner-up finish in the 2013 Battle 4 Atlantis tournament and a loss to in\u2013state rival Iowa State. The Hawkeyes finished the Big Ten Conference season with a 9\u20139 record and a regular season record of 20\u201312. The Hawkeyes were seeded sixth in the Big Ten Conference tournament but lost to No. 11-seeded Northwestern 67\u201362, a team that the Hawkeyes had twice beaten by 26 points in two conference season games. The Hawkeyes played in the 'first four' during the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, playing Tennessee in the first round of the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.  This was their first NCAA Tournament appearance since the 2005\u20132006 season.\n\nThe 2014\u20132015 Hawkeyes finished their non\u2013conference schedule 9\u20134, with losses to #10 Texas (71\u201357) and #23 Syracuse (66\u201363) in the 2K Classic. Additional non-conference losses came at the hands of rivals #14 Iowa State (90\u201375) and UNI (56\u201344). McCaffery led Iowa to a 12\u20136 record in the Big Ten, including memorable wins over #20 Ohio State (71\u201365) and #17 Maryland (71\u201355). McCaffrey's Hawkeyes were upset in the second round of the Big Ten tournament by Penn State (67\u201358), but still finished tied for third in the conference. Iowa earned a 7th seed in the NCAA Tournament and beat Davidson (83\u201352) in the Round of 64 before bowing out to Gonzaga (87\u201368) in the third round. McCaffery's Hawkeyes finished 22\u201312 on the year.\nDuring the 2015\u201316 season, the University of Iowa reached a new peak during the McCaffery era, twice defeating Michigan State during the regular season, attaining a 19\u20134 overall record and a No. 3 Associated Press rankings. However, the Hawkeyes lost seven of their last 10 games, including a 68\u201366 loss to 12th-seeded Illinois in the second round of the Big Ten Conference tournament, a team the Hawkeyes had defeated handily a month earlier and would not play in the post\u2013season. As a result of the late\u2013season swoon, the Hawkeyes fell to No. 25 in the final Associated Press rankings. Seeded seventh in the NCAA Division I tournament's South regional, the Hawkeyes used a buzzer-beating tip-in to defeat Temple 72\u201370 in overtime. The Hawkeyes lost to second\u2013seeded Villanova in the second round, 87\u201368, to end the season 22\u201311.\nAfter the 2015\u201316 season graduated 4 senior starters, Iowa got off to a rocky start to the 2016\u201317 campaign, going 3\u20135 with losses to Seton Hall (91\u201383), Virginia (74\u201341), Memphis (100\u201392), Notre Dame (92\u201378), and Nebraska\u2013Omaha (98\u201389). The Hawkeyes turned things around in December and ended non-conference play with five straight victories, including wins over in-state rivals #25 Iowa State (78\u201364) and UNI (69\u201346). Iowa finished non-conference play 8\u20135 on the year. The Hawkeyes went 10\u20138 in conference play, with wins over Michigan (86\u201383), #17 Purdue (83\u201378), Ohio State (85\u201372), #24 Maryland (83\u201369), Indiana (96\u201390), and #22 Wisconsin (59\u201357). McCaffery's Hawkeyes were invited to the NIT post-season tournament and defeated South Dakota (87\u201375) before losing in overtime to eventual champion TCU (94\u201392), finishing their season 19\u201315. Senior Peter Jok lead the Big Ten in scoring (19.9 ppg) and was first-team all\u2013conference.\n\nThe 2017\u201318 season was a disaster for the Hawkeyes. After losing the Big Ten leading scorer, Peter Jok, a young Iowa team struggled to find their identity. Coach McCaffery's eldest son, Connor, joined the team as an ESPN four\u2013star recruit out of local Iowa City West, but battled a series of ailments, including mononucleosis, which lead to being granted a medical redshirt year. Iowa finished the season 14\u201319, 4\u201314 in Big Ten play in a three-way tie for 11th place. As the No. 12 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they defeated Illinois before losing to Michigan in the second round.\nIn 2018\u201319 a young Iowa team won the 2K Sports Classic early in the season, defeating #13 Oregon (77\u201369) and UCONN (91\u201372) in back\u2013to\u2013back nights at Madison Square Garden. The Hawkeyes would go undefeated in non\u2013conference play, with wins over in\u2013state rivals Iowa State (98\u201384) and UNI (77\u201354). They also scored a whopping 68 points in the first half of a 105\u201378 win over Alabama State and beat Savannah State by 46 (110\u201364). Iowa's season featured several thrilling contests, including a 1-point victory over Pitt (69\u201368), and buzzer-beating wins in back\u2013to\u2013back games against Northwestern (80\u201379) and Rutgers (71\u201369). Iowa just missed a chance to make it three last\u2013second victories in a row, but a shot as time expired rimmed out against #24 Maryland (66\u201365). Other notable regular season victories for Iowa included wins over #24 Nebraska (93\u201384), #16 Ohio State (72\u201362), and #5 Michigan (74\u201359). The Hawkeyes ended the regular season on a 4\u2013game losing streak. In the Big Ten tournament, Iowa defeated Illinois before falling to Michigan. The Hawkeyes earned the No. 10 seed in the South Regional in the NCAA Tournament. In the first round, the Hawkeyes came from behind to upset seventh-seed Cincinnati (79\u201372). Then, Iowa faced off against second seed Tennessee in the Round of 32. The Hawkeyes came back from a 25-point deficit in the first half to send the game to overtime, which was won by Tennessee.\nThe 2019\u201320 season saw Iowa complete a 9\u20132 non-conference schedule with notable wins over rival Iowa State (84\u201368), and #12 ranked Texas Tech (72\u201361). The Iowa squad was led by standout center Luka Garza, who averaged 23.9 points and 9.8 rebounds en route to numerous accolades. Garza would go on to win the Big Ten Player of the Year, Sporting News Men's College Basketball Player of the Year, Pete Newell Big Man Award, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, and consensus All-American honors while leading the Hawkeyes to a 20\u201311 record that featured conference wins over #12 Maryland (67\u201349), #19 Michigan (90\u201383), #24 Rutgers (85\u201380), #19 Illinois (72\u201365), #25 Ohio State (85\u201376), and #16 Penn State (77\u201368). The 2019\u201320 season ended abruptly with the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus without a postseason being played. McCaffery's younger son, Patrick, another ESPN four\u2013star recruit, joined the team as a freshman but took a medical redshirt while recovering from the residual effects thyroid cancer treatment.\n\nBen McCollum era (2025\u2013present)\nIowa basketball coaches\nThe Hawkeyes have had 22 coaches in their 118-year history. Fran McCaffery was the coach till March 14, 2025. Two coaches have been named Big Ten Conference Coach-of-the-Year since it officially began in 1975: Lute Olson in 1979 and Tom Davis in 1987. Four Iowa coaches have been inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame: Sam Barry, Ralph Miller, Lute Olson and George Raveling.\n\nHead-to-head Big Ten records since 1949\u201350\nNote: Through 2024\u201325 season\nSource: Iowa Hawkeyes Head-to-Head Results\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Hawkeyes have appeared in the NCAA tournament 29 times.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) uses officially recognized All-America selectors to determine the consensus selections. Over time, the sources used to determine the consensus selections have varied. Currently, the NCAA uses four \"major\" selectors to determine consensus All-Americans: the Associated Press, The National Association of Basketball Coaches, the United States Basketball Writers Association and Sporting News magazine.  Since 1984, the NCAA has applied a standardized point system to those teams designated as \"major\" All-American teams to determine consensus teams.  The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation.  The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team. Many other publications and organization compile their own \"minor\" All-America teams in addition to the selectors listed here.\nThrough the 2023 season, 16 Iowa players have earned 21 All-America selections.  Of Iowa's 21 All-Americans, 5 were First-team All-American selections \u2013 all 5 were consensus First team selections.

  "Iowa State Cyclones": {
    "biography": "The Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team represents Iowa State University (ISU) and competes in the Big 12 Conference of NCAA Division I. The Cyclones play their home games at Hilton Coliseum on Iowa State's campus.\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1908\u20131980)\nFrom 1907 to 1928, the Cyclones played in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, managing a few winning records in-conference but no championships. In 1929, the Cyclones moved to the Big Six Conference and named Louis Menze as head coach. Over the next 19 years, Menze would lead the Cyclones to four conference championships (their only seasons with a winning conference record in this period). Two of these teams earned consideration for the then eight-team NCAA tournament; the 1941 squad lost in a pre-Tournament \"qualifying game\" to Creighton.  Three years later, the 1944 team beat Pepperdine to reach the semifinals in the tournament proper before losing its next game against eventual champion Utah, good for a spot in history as a Final Four participant.\nAfter Menze's last conference win in 1945 and subsequent resignation as coach in 1947 (he would remain Iowa State's athletic director until 1958, having taken the position in 1945), the Cyclones floated between the bottom and the middle of the conference for decades, their main claim to fame being two wins of the conference's annual \"Holiday tournament\", played between Christmas and New Year's Day in Kansas City, in 1955 and 1959. Neither these tournament wins, nor their regular season performances, qualified the Cyclones for postseason play in the 33 years between Menze's and Johnny Orr's stints in the head coaching position. However, the 1957 Cyclones were ranked #3 in the nation after handing Wilt Chamberlain's #1 Kansas its first loss.\n\nGary Thompson outscored Chamberlain, while Don Medsker held Chamberlain to 17 points the 2nd lowest of his career and then hit the game winner at the buzzer. From the introduction of the Big Eight's postseason tournament in 1977 until Johnny Orr's fifth season in 1985, the Cyclones did not advance past their first game.\nIn 1971, Maury John left Drake University to move to Iowa State. John led Drake to the 1969 NCAA Final Four and the Elite Eight in 1970 NCAA tournament and 1971 NCAA tournament. John inherited an Iowa State team that was 5\u201321 the previous season. John was excited about the new Hilton Coliseum and led Iowa State to a 12\u201314 record in 1971\u201372 and a 16\u201310 record in 1972\u201373, a 15-year best. On Dec. 2, 1971, in the first game played at Hilton Coliseum, John led the Cyclones to a victory over Arizona 71\u201354. Said Cyclone announcer Eric Heft, a player for Coach John: \"The place was sold out for the Arizona game and we doubled the capacity of season tickets from the season before. We didn't have all the fanfare you have today, but it was packed. It was my first game and Maury John's first game as the head Cyclone coach as well.\"\nIn the 1973\u201374 season, Iowa State was off to a 4\u20131 start. But, John sat out the remainder of the 1973\u201374 season after a cancer diagnosis. Assistant Gus Guydon (11\u201310) finished the season. In October 1973, John had seen a doctor after having health concerns. Two months later, on the day his Iowa State team lost at Drake, John was told he had an inoperable malignant tumor at the base of his esophagus. \"It was a bolt out of the blue for someone who lived his life free of smoking or drinking,\" His son John said later. \"There was high stress. But he was always healthy.\"\nJohn was optimistic about returning to Iowa State in 1974\u201375, but his health worsened and he resigned on July 30, 1974. John said \"It's going to be hard for me not to be on that bench. I won't have to sweat out all those games down on the floor. But truthfully, I'd rather be down there sweating them out.\" John died on October 15, 1974, at the age of 55. During a 28\u2010year coaching career, John had a 528\u2013214 record. John's departure sent the Cyclones into free fall. In the next six years, Iowa State would only have one winning season, bottoming out in 1975\u201376 with a 3\u201324 record, still the worst in school history.\n\nJohnny Orr era (1980\u20131994)\nJohnny Orr came to Iowa State from Michigan in 1980. Iowa State's athletics director had called Orr to inquire about Michigan assistant Bill Frieder. When Orr learned of the salary Iowa State would offer Frieder, he negotiated the Iowa State head coaching job for himself. Orr is credited with building \"Hilton Magic\" and laying the foundation for Iowa State's success in men's basketball. A number of Cyclone greats played for Orr, including Jeff Grayer, Barry Stevens, walk-on Jeff Hornacek, Lafester Rhodes, Justus Thigpen, Victor Alexander, Fred Hoiberg, Julius Michalik, and Loren Meyer, many of whom would go on to success in the NBA.\nOrr's first team (1980\u201381), led by junior forward Robert Estes (14.9 points per game, 6.7 rebounds per game) produced a lackluster 9\u201318 record. Freshman forward Ron Harris, whom Orr considered his first prominent Cyclone recruit, contributed per-game averages of 13.7 points and 5.9 rebounds.\nLed by sophomore Ron Harris and freshman recruit Barry Stevens of Flint, Michigan, Orr's 1981\u201382 team finished the season with a 10\u201317 overall record and a 5\u20139 record in Big Eight play. Harris gave the Cyclones 13.3 points per game, while Stevens contributed 13.0 points per game. Senior Robert Estes added 10.3 points per game.\nThe Cyclones improved to a 13\u201315 overall record in the 1982\u201383 season, but again finished 5\u20139 in conference play. Many of the Cyclone faithful regard sophomore Barry Stevens' buzzer-beating shot against 10th-ranked Missouri during the 1982\u201383 season as the foundational example of \"Hilton Magic.\" Stevens tallied per-game averages of 16.8 points and 5.2 rebounds for the season. Ron Harris contributed 14.3 points per game.\nOrr's 1983\u201384 team recorded the first winning season of his tenure at Iowa State\u2014and the first winning season for Cyclone basketball since Lynn Nance's 1977\u201378 team finished 14\u201313\u2014with a 16\u201313 overall mark and a 6\u20138 record in conference play.

He remains the winningest coach in Iowa State history (in terms of total wins), with a win\u2013loss record of 218\u2013200 as the head coach of the Cyclones.\n\nTim Floyd era (1994\u20131998)\nFollowing Johnny Orr's retirement, Iowa State hired Tim Floyd from the University of New Orleans to become the next men's basketball head coach. Floyd's first ISU team recorded a 23\u201311 overall mark and a 6\u20138 mark in conference play, advancing to the second round of the 1995 NCAA tournament by beating Florida, 64\u201361, before losing 73\u201351 to #2 seed North Carolina.

The Cyclones would advance to the third NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteen in Iowa State men's basketball history with victories over Illinois State and Cincinnati, before falling in a 74\u201373 overtime loss to UCLA. Senior Dedric Willoughby averaged 18.9 points per game for the season, and seniors Kenny Pratt and Kelvin Cato averaged 14.7 points and 6.1 rebounds per game and 11.3 points and 8.4 rebounds per game, respectively.\nTim Floyd's 1997\u201398 Cyclones finished the season with a 12\u201318 overall record and a 5\u201311 conference record.

Following the season, Floyd left Iowa State to replace Phil Jackson as the head coach of the Chicago Bulls.\n\nLarry Eustachy era (1998\u20132003)\nIowa State hired Larry Eustachy from Utah State to fill the head coaching position vacated by Tim Floyd. In his first season, Eustachy led the Cyclones to 15\u201315 overall record and a 6\u201310 record in Big 12 play. Sophomore Marcus Fizer averaged 18 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. Michael Nurse and Martin Rancik both averaged 10.3 points per game.\nFollowing his first season, Eustachy gained the services of two guards, Jamaal Tinsley and Kantrail Horton, via transfer. The 1999\u20132000 Cyclones returned Marcus Fizer, Martin Rancik, Michael Nurse, and Stevie Johnson from the previous season's team. Iowa State finished the season 32\u20135 overall, setting a school record for wins in a season. The Cyclones finished 14\u20132 in conference play to earn the outright Big 12 Conference regular season championship\u2014the sixth regular season conference title in the program's history, and the first since 1945. The Cyclones then defeated Oklahoma 70\u201358 in the Big 12 basketball tournament finals to win the Big 12 conference tournament championship, the second conference tournament title in ISU men's basketball history. The #2 seed Cyclones advanced to the Elite Eight of the 2000 NCAA tournament after wins over #15 seed Central Connecticut State, #7 seed Auburn, and #6 seed UCLA by 10, 19, and 24 points, respectively, but ultimately fell to Michigan State, the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75\u201364 (the differential representing the Spartans' narrowest margin of victory during the tournament). It was the Cyclones' deepest NCAA Tournament run in the modern era. The Big 12 champion Cyclones were led in scoring by All-American forward and eventual fourth pick of the 2000 NBA draft Marcus Fizer, who averaged 22.8 points per game and 7.7 rebounds per game. Michael Nurse and first team All-Big 12 guard Jamaal Tinsley contributed 12.5 points and 11 points per game, respectively.\nDespite the departure of Marcus Fizer to the NBA, Eustachy's 2000\u201301 Cyclones, led by returning senior and eventual All-American guard Jamaal Tinsley and senior Kantrail Horton, managed a 25\u20136 overall record and a 13\u20133 record in conference play, earning a second consecutive Big 12 regular season championship. Iowa State earned a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament, but the Cyclones' season ended with a stunning 58\u201357 defeat at the hands of #15 seed Hampton. Iowa State became just the fourth #2 seed to lose to a #15 seed since the expansion of the Tournament field to 64 teams in 1985. Jamaal Tinsley led the team in scoring with 14.3 points per game. Martin Rancik and freshman Jake Sullivan added 13.2 points per game and 11.4 points per game, respectively.\nThe 2001\u201302 Cyclones produced the worst overall men's basketball record since the 1990\u201391 season, finishing 12\u201319 overall record and 4\u201312 in conference play. Tyray Pearson averaged 18.7 points and 7.8 rebounds per game. Jake Sullivan and Shane Power contributed per-game averages of 16 points and 13.6 points, respectively.\nThe 2002\u201303 Cyclones finished with a 17\u201314 overall record and a 5\u201311 conference record. ISU accepted an invitation to the NIT. The Cyclones defeated Wichita State in the opening (play-in) round, but fell 54\u201353 to Iowa in the first round. Jake Sullivan led the team in scoring with 17 points per game. Jackson Vroman contributed 12.5 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. Junior point guard Tim Barnes averaged 11.3 points per game.\nFollowing the 2002\u201303 season, pictures surfaced showing Larry Eustachy at a student party in Columbia, Missouri. Eustachy attended the party just hours after his team had lost to Missouri. Though Eustachy broke no laws, he did violate a conduct clause in his contract, which led to Eustachy's public admission of alcoholism. Eustachy subsequently resigned on May 5, 2003, receiving a $960,000 settlement from Iowa State.\n\nWayne Morgan & Greg McDermott era (2003\u20132010)\nAfter Eustachy's resignation, Iowa State promoted Wayne Morgan, who had previously served as an assistant coach, to the head coach position. Morgan's first team, in the 2003\u201304 season, went 20\u201313 overall and 7\u20139 in the conference, earning an invitation to the NIT. Iowa State reached the NIT semifinals with wins over Georgia, Florida State, and Marquette, before falling to Rutgers. Freshman Curtis Stinson led the team in scoring, averaging 16.2 points per game. The following season, a 19\u201312 (9\u20137) record earned Iowa State a 9-seed in the NCAA Tournament. The team defeated the University of Minnesota in a 1st-round game, but then lost to eventual national champion North Carolina. Stinson, fellow sophomore Will Blalock, and senior Jared Homan led the team in scoring, assists, and rebounds, respectively. In 2005\u201306, the team, still led by Stinson and Blalock, took a step back to a 16\u201314 (6\u201310) record. Following the season, CBS Sportsline reported that Morgan had paid a company to arrange the team's non-conference scheduling in exchange for recruiting assistance. Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard fired Morgan two days after the story was released. Morgan's win-loss record from 2003 to 2006 was 55\u201339.\nTo replace Morgan, Iowa State hired Greg McDermott, who previously coached at Northern Iowa. During McDermott's tenure, he recruited Craig Brackins, Michael Taylor, Justin Hamilton, Diante Garrett and Wes Johnson, all of whom would eventually play in the NBA. In 2010, McDermott resigned to accept the head coaching position at Creighton. From 2006 to 2010 Greg McDermott recorded a won lost record of 59\u201368 with no NCAA appearances. He was replaced by Fred Hoiberg.\n\nFred Hoiberg era (2010\u20132015)\nOn April 27, 2010, it was announced that Fred Hoiberg, a star at Iowa State in the early and mid-1990s, would become the 19th coach in the history of the Iowa State men's basketball program. In his first season as coach, Hoiberg led a team with only four returning players to a 16\u201316 record.\nIn his second season, Iowa State had a much deeper team with players such as Royce White, Chris Babb, and others now eligible to play after sitting out the previous year due to transfer rules. The Cyclones improved to 23-11, had 12 wins in the conference, and earned a #8 seed in the South Regional in the 2012 NCAA tournament, earning Hoiberg Big 12 Co-Coach of the Year honors. The Cyclones defeated the #9 seed and defending national champion Connecticut Huskies before falling to overall #1 seed and eventual champion Kentucky.\nIn Hoiberg's third season, the Cyclones earned a #10 seed and defeated #7 Notre Dame to advance to the Round of 32. It was the first year the Cyclones had been to the NCAA Tournament in back-to-back years since 2000\u201301, and the first time the Cyclones had won Tournament games in successive seasons since 1996\u201397.\nHoiberg entered his fourth season at Iowa State by guiding the team to its best start to a season with a 14\u20130 undefeated non-conference record before suffering its first loss to Big 12 rival Oklahoma, 87\u201382, on January 11, 2014, in Norman. The winning streak included victories over #7 Michigan and #23 Iowa, plus wins over George Mason, Akron, and Boise State to capture the Diamond Head Classic in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Cyclones entered the Big 12 men's basketball tournament with a 23\u20137 mark. After a close call with Kansas State in the quarterfinals, Iowa State faced Kansas in the semifinals, the only team it had not beaten at least once all year to that point. ISU emerged victorious this time, beating the Jayhawks, 94\u201383. Iowa State went on to beat Baylor in the Big 12 championship game, 74\u201365, for its first conference tournament title since 2000.\nThe Cyclones earned a #3 seed in the East Regional of the 2014 NCAA tournament and defeated their first opponent, North Carolina Central, 93\u201375. Another close call came next in the third-round game against North Carolina, with ISU prevailing, 85\u201383. The Cyclones advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2000, and lost to #7 seed Connecticut, 81\u201376 (the differential representing the Huskies' narrowest margin of victory during the tournament), the eventual national champion. This marked the third time in their last four trips to the NCAA Tournament that the Cyclones lost to the eventual national champions (2005 North Carolina, 2012 Kentucky, and 2014 Connecticut.)\nIn 2014\u201315, Hoiberg's Cyclones finished the season with a 25\u20139 overall record and 12\u20136 in the Big 12, finishing second to Kansas in the conference regular season. ISU defeated Texas, 69\u201367, Oklahoma, 67\u201365, and Kansas, 70\u201366, in the championship to win its second straight Big 12 Conference tournament championship. Invited to the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive year, the #3 seed Cyclones were upset by #14 seed UAB, 60\u201359, in the first round. The Cyclones finished the season ranked ninth in the final AP poll.  After several weeks of speculation, Fred Hoiberg was hired on June 2, 2015, by the NBA's Chicago Bulls to be their head coach.\n\nSteve Prohm era (2015\u20132021)\nOn June 8, 2015, Iowa State announced that Steve Prohm, previously the head coach at Murray State for four seasons, would become the 20th head coach of the Cyclones. After the departure of Fred Hoiberg, Prohm retained Assistant Coach T.J. Otzelberger and Assistant Coach Director of Basketball Operations Micah Byars on his staff, while making the additions of Assistant Coach William Small (formerly under Prohm as an assistant at Murray State), Assistant Coach Daniyal Robinson (formerly on staff at Loyola Chicago), and Special Assistant to the Head Coach Neill Berry, who was previously on staff at High Point and played for Prohm in college at Southeastern Louisiana.  Prohm's first season was a success with a few bumps along the way.  The Cyclones finished the regular season 10\u20138 in conference play and 21\u201310 overall; this included wins over No. 1 Oklahoma and No. 4 Kansas.  The Cyclones then received a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament.  After wins over Iona and Arkansas\u2013Little Rock, they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to Virginia.  After the conclusion of the season, Otzelberger accepted the head coaching job at South Dakota State, and Neill Berry was promoted to assistant coach.\nOn February 4, 2017, Iowa State won at No. 3 Kansas, ending the longest active home win streak in NCAA men's college basketball at 54 games. Iowa State became the first team to beat Bill Self more than once at Allen Fieldhouse. The Cyclones then proceeded to win their third conference tournament title in four years with wins over Oklahoma State, TCU and West Virginia. The Cyclones were selected as a five seed in NCAA tournament, where they proceeded to beat the University of Nevada in the tournament's second round. Iowa State then lost to 4-seed Purdue in the round of 32, 80\u201376.\nAfter a down 2017\u20132018 season, in 2018-2019 the Cyclones went 23\u201312 and 9\u20139 in the Big 12 conference.  They faced Baylor in the first round of the Big 12 Tournament, winning 83\u201366. They next beat number 1 seed Kansas State, 63\u201359.  They played Kansas in the Big 12 Championship and won 78\u201366. They were a 6 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they lost in the first round to Ohio State, an 11 seed. On March 26, Iowa State announced that Prohm's contract had been extended through 2025,  while sophomore forward Cameron Lard requested a transfer from the school, citing the need for a fresh start.\nFollowing a disappointing 2\u201322 season (0-18 in the Big 12), on March 15, 2021, Prohm was fired as the head men's basketball coach.\n\nT.J. Otzelberger era (2021\u2013present)\nOn March 18, 2021, T. J. Otzelberger, who had been the head coach at UNLV for the previous two seasons, was named the 21st head coach at Iowa State. Otzelberger had previously been an assistant under three head coaches at ISU. The 2021-2022 season was an incredible turnaround from the prior year's two-win campaign. The Cyclones finished 22\u201313 in Otzelberger's first season with victories over Texas Tech, Texas, Memphis, and Iowa. The team went undefeated in nonconference play, suffering its first loss to #1 ranked Baylor on January 1, 2022. The Cyclones would qualify for the NCAA tournament as an 11-seed, but would lose in the Sweet 16 to the University of Miami. \nThe team continued its growth in the 2022\u201323 season. The Cyclones went 19\u201314 overall and 9\u20139 in conference play, ending tied for 6th. They would advance to the semifinals in the Big 12 tournament, but would lose to Kansas 71\u201358. The Cyclones earned a 6-seed in the 2023 NCAA Tournament, but were upset by No. 11 Pittsburgh in the first round.\nThe 2023-2024 season saw Iowa State continue its success under Coach Otzelberger. The Cyclones started 11-2 in non-conference play, finishing the season with an overall record of 27\u20137 and a conference record of 13\u20135, a second place finish in the Big 12. The Cyclones won the Big 12 Championship, defeating No. 9 Kansas State 76\u201357, No. 4 Baylor 76\u201362, and obliterating No. 1 Houston 69\u201341 in the largest blowout in the history of the Big 12 tournament. They would end ranked No. 4 on the AP Top 25 and with the best defense in the nation. In the NCAA Men's Tournament, the team entered as a No. 2 seed and defeated No. 15 South Dakota State Jackrabbits and No. 7 Washington State in the opening rounds, to move on to the Sweet 16. There the Cyclones saw the season end, falling to No.3 Illinois 72\u201369.\n\nHead coach history\nSeason records\nChampionships\nAll-time records\nRecord vs. Big 12 opponents\nCurrent Big 12 opponents\nFormer Big 12 opponents\nRecord versus Iowa schools\nRecords vs Iowa schools as of December 16, 2024.\n\nPostseason tournament history\nIowa State has appeared in the NCAA Tournament 23 times, with a current record of 24\u201324.\n\nSeeds\nNCAA tournament\nPageantry and traditions\nTeam name\nThe original \"Cyclone\" football team first played during 1895. This team earned the nickname \"Cyclones\" when they soundly defeated Northwestern, 36\u20130. The Chicago Tribune the next day headlined the story about the game \"STRUCK BY A CYCLONE \u2014 It Comes From Iowa and Devastates Evanston Town.\" Since then the name Cyclones has been associated with Iowa State.\n\nMascot\nBorrowing from one of its school colors, Iowa State uses a cardinal, Cy, as its mascot instead of an actual tornado or Cyclone. Prior to the football match-up against Colorado on November 12, 2005, a tornado touched down in several places in and around Ames, Iowa, forcing fans to either weather the storm outside in the parking lot or seek shelter in the adjacent Bergstrom Indoor Training Facility or nearby Hilton Coliseum. Such an atmosphere was created that Iowa State was able to beat the favored Buffaloes, 30\u201316. When asked about the event, Colorado coach Gary Barnett said, \"I thought we had a pretty good mascot. But when we showed up at Iowa State and they had a real tornado, that's the real deal.\"\n\nRivalries\nIowa\nWhile the Kansas Jayhawks are the Cyclone's main basketball rival, Iowa State's biggest non-conference rival is the Cyclone's in-state rival the Iowa Hawkeyes.  This rivalry game counts toward the Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series that encompasses all athletic competitions between Iowa and Iowa State. The series began in 1909\u201310, but it was suspended between 1935 and 1970.  As of the 2024\u201325 season, Iowa leads the all-time basketball series 48\u201330.\n\nHy-Vee Classic\nIn the Hy-Vee Classic, which ran from 2012 to 2018, Iowa State played in-state rivals from the Missouri Valley Conference at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, on an alternating basis each December: Drake in even years and Northern Iowa in odd years.\nAs of the 2018\u201319 season, Iowa State has a 38\u201313 lead in the all-time series against Northern Iowa (going 2\u20131 in Hy-Vee Classic games). Also as of that season, Iowa State has a 110\u201365 all-time series lead over Drake (going 4\u20130 in Hy-Vee Classic games).\n\nFacilities\nHilton Coliseum\n\nJames H. Hilton Coliseum is a 14,384-seat multi-purpose arena in Ames, Iowa. The arena, which is part of the Iowa State Center, opened in 1971. It is home to the Iowa State Cyclones basketball, wrestling, gymnastics, and volleyball teams. The building was specifically built to hold in sound with a solid concrete structure, steel doors, and a crowd that sits just a few feet from the court. During big games, players from opposing teams, as well as Iowa State, have even said that the floor has shaken due to the loudness of the crowd. A record basketball crowd of 15,000 saw the Cyclones post a 97\u201394 win over Iowa in 1971.\nHilton Magic is the atmosphere created by the fans at Hilton Coliseum during men's and women's basketball games. The now famous moniker for Iowa State's home basketball facility was coined by Des Moines Register writer Buck Turnbull on February 14, 1989, after the Cyclones (with Johnny Orr as coach) stunned third-ranked Missouri,  82\u201375. The morning newspaper included a headline that read \"Hilton Magic Spells 'Upset' One More Time.\" In the article, Turnbull called for more Hilton Magic in an upcoming game with Oklahoma State. Cyclone fans responded and ISU defeated the Cowboys, 90\u201381, and a nickname was born.\nAccording to many sources, Hilton Coliseum is considered one of the toughest venues to play in the nation.\nSukup Basketball Complex\nOpened in September 2009, Iowa State's new basketball practice facility is located on two acres of land (in west Ames) that was donated by a local developer, Dickson Jensen.

  "James Madison Dukes": {
    "biography": "The James Madison Dukes men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The school, a member of Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, joined the Sun Belt Conference on July 1, 2022, after having been a member of the Colonial Athletic Association since that league's establishment in 1979. The Dukes are led by head coach Preston Spradlin. The Dukes play their home games at the on-campus Atlantic Union Bank Center which seats 8,500 fans and opened in November 2020. The Dukes have appeared six times in the NCAA tournament, most recently in 2024.\n\nHistory\nThe James Madison Dukes men's basketball team was founded in 1945, but was not a fully developed program until the late 1960s as James Madison University became a fully coeducational institution. The 1969\u20131970 season was the first as a varsity intercollegiate program. The Dukes were led by Cleve Branscum during the team's first two seasons, compiling a record of 20\u201317. The program was guided by new Administrative Director Dean Ehlers for the 1971\u20131972 season. Ehlers hired Lou Campanelli following the season, but remained at James Madison as the A.D. until 1993.\n\nLou Campanelli era\nTaking over as the James Madison head coach in 1972, Lou Campanelli led the Dukes program for thirteen years (1972\u20131985). Campanelli coached the Dukes to two NCAA Division II basketball tournaments and then three NCAA Division I basketball tournaments after the school transitioned from Division II to Division I. In the Dukes' first ever appearance in the NCAA Division I tournament in 1981, Campanelli coached the team to a win over Georgetown. The Dukes would win a game in each of the Dukes\u2019 following appearances in the NCAA Division I tournament under Campanelli, and lost by two points to eventual national champions University of North Carolina in the second round of the 1982 tournament.\nLou Campanelli was hired as the head coach at California in 1985. Campanelli finished at James Madison with a record of 238\u2013118.\n\nJohn Thurston era\nJohn Thurston was hired as the fourth head coach of the James Madison Dukes men's basketball team in 1985. Prior to this, Thurston had served as an assistant coach under Campanelli with the Dukes since 1975. Thurston successfully turned the program around in his second season at the helm, guiding the Dukes to a 20\u201310 record, a berth in the National Invitation Tournament, and was named Colonial Athletic Association Coach of the Year. However, with a 6\u201311 start to the 1988 season, James Madison University President Ronald E. Carrier announced that Thurston's contract would not be renewed at the end of the season and Thurston resigned hours later. The Dukes replaced Thurston with interim head coach Tom McCorry to finish the 1988 season.\n\nLefty Driesell era\nIn 1988, the Dukes hired former Davidson and Maryland head coach Lefty Driesell to lead the program. Driesell led the Dukes for nine seasons, compiling a record of 159\u2013111 and taking the Dukes to the NCAA tournament in 1994.\n\nSherman Dillard era\nIn 1997, James Madison hired Sherman Dillard to lead the men's basketball program. Sherman Dillard played basketball at James Madison under Lou Campanelli from 1973 to 1978. Prior to accepting the position at JMU, he had been the coach at Indiana State. He led the Dukes through the 2004 season, guiding the program to one regular season title in 2000 and compiling a record of 93\u2013106.\n\nDean Keener era\nThe Dukes hired Dean Keener in 2004 to be the program's next men's basketball head coach. Keener came from Georgia Tech, where he was an assistant on the 2004 National Runner-Up team. He had also been a one time assistant coach at JMU under Sherman Dillard for the 1999\u20132000 season.\nUnder Keener, the Dukes compiled a record of 31\u201385. During the 2008 season, Keener resigned as the head coach, but he led the team through the end of the season.\n\nMatt Brady era\nJames Madison hired Matt Brady to be the head coach of the men's basketball program in 2008. In his first season, Brady led the Dukes to an 18-win regular season and earned the program's first postseason berth since 1994 in the newly created CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament.\nUnder Brady in 2013, the Dukes won their first CAA tournament since 1994, earning a berth in the NCAA tournament. As a 16 seed, the Dukes defeated Long Island in the First Four before being defeated by Indiana in the second round.\nMatt Brady led the Dukes to a share of the regular season CAA title in 2015 but the Dukes did not win the CAA Tournament and were invited to the CIT tournament. Brady was fired following the 2016 season, despite winning 21 games.\n\nLouis Rowe era\nIn 2016, James Madison hired JMU men's basketball alumnus and former assistant coach Louis Rowe to be the program's tenth men's basketball coach. Rowe led the Dukes for four seasons before being let go at the end of the 2020 season. Under Rowe, the Dukes compiled a record of 43\u201385.\n\nMark Byington era\nIn March 2020, James Madison hired Mark Byington to lead the Dukes men's basketball team. Before coming to JMU, Byington was the head coach at Georgia Southern. In his first season at JMU, Mark Byington lead the Dukes to a share of the regular season title, the team's first since the 2015 season.\nIn the first season of his tenure at James Madison, the Dukes opened their new on-campus arena, the Atlantic Union Bank Center.\nOn December 7, 2021, Byington's Dukes defeated Virginia for the first time in program history in front of a sold-out home crowd.\nThe 2023\u201324 season started with a road wins at Michigan State and Kent State, both of which broke home winning streaks held by the teams. The Dukes followed up those wins with a win at home over Howard, propelling the Dukes into the AP Top 25 for the first time in program history. On December 9, 2023, the team broke their record for best start to a season by defeating Old Dominion University to start 9\u20130. After a 14\u20130 start to the season, the best start in program history, the Dukes dropped their first game of the season on January 6 at Southern Miss. The Dukes won the 2024 Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournament, securing an automatic bid to the 2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. As the 12 seed in the South region, the Dukes upset 5 seed Wisconsin in the First Round, before losing to Duke in the Second Round. This was the first time that the Dukes advanced to the Second Round of the NCAA Tournament since the 1993-94 season. The Dukes finished the 2023\u201324 season with a record of 32\u20134, the best in program history.\nFollowing the Dukes' loss in the NCAA Tournament, Mark Byington accepted the head coach position at Vanderbilt. Byington guided the Dukes to an 82\u201336 record across his four seasons as head coach.\n\nPreston Spradlin era\nOn March 29, 2024, James Madison hired Preston Spradlin as the new head coach of the men's basketball team. Spradlin previously led the Morehead State Eagles for eight seasons.\n\nRivalries\nHistorically, James Madison's rivals had been in-state members of the Colonial Athletic Association: William & Mary, VCU, George Mason, Old Dominion, and Richmond. Now members of the Sun Belt Conference, the Dukes only remaining conference rival from the old CAA is Old Dominion. However, James Madison has continued to schedule its former conference rivals in non-conference play. James Madison and Old Dominion's basketball rivalry is also a part of their all-sports rivalry known as the Royal Rivalry.\n\nJames Madison vs. In-State NCAA Division I Schools\nJames Madison vs. Sun Belt Members\nThis reflects the Dukes' record against the current Sun Belt Conference's membership as of the 2023\u201324 season.\n\nJames Madison vs. CAA Members\nJames Madison also maintained competitive series against the other members of the Colonial Athletic Association during their tenure in the CAA.\n\nSource:\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA Division I tournament results\nThe Dukes have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament six times.

  "Kansas Jayhawks": {
    "biography": "The Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball program is the intercollegiate men's basketball program of the University of Kansas. The program is classified in the NCAA's Division I and the team competes in the Big 12 Conference. Kansas is renowned for having one of the most prestigious and historic intercollegiate basketball programs in North America. In the United States, Kansas has six overall national championships (4 NCAA Tournament National Championships and 2 Helms National Championships), as well as being runner-up six times and having the most conference titles in the nation.\nThe Jayhawks own the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances with 28 consecutive appearances. Since the 1984 tournament, the Jayhawks have only missed the tournament twice due to disciplinary action from the NCAA; they were ruled ineligible for the 1989 tournament and 2018 being vacated. They have not missed the tournament strictly due to on the court performance since the 1983 tournament. They were also, along with Dartmouth, the first team to appear in multiple NCAA Tournaments after making their second appearance in the 1942 tournament. The Jayhawks had been ranked in the AP poll for 231 consecutive polls, a streak that had stretched from the poll released on February 2, 2009, through the poll released on February 8, 2021, which is the longest streak in AP poll history. Of the 28 seasons the Big 12 conference has been in existence, Kansas has won at least a share of 21 regular-season conference titles.\nThe Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of basketball, James Naismith. Naismith, ironically, is the only coach in Kansas basketball history with a losing record. The Kansas basketball program has produced many notable professional players, including Clyde Lovellette, Wilt Chamberlain, Jo Jo White, Danny Manning, Raef LaFrentz, Paul Pierce, Nick Collison, Kirk Hinrich, Mario Chalmers, Andrew Wiggins, and Joel Embiid. Politician Bob Dole also played basketball at Kansas. Former players that have gone on to be coaches include Phog Allen, Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg, and former assistants to go on to be notable coaches include John Calipari, Gregg Popovich, and Bill Self. Mark Turgeon, Jerod Haase, Danny Manning, and Tad Boyle are all former players and assistant coaches that became head coaches. Allen founded the National Association of Basketball Coaches and, with Lonborg, was an early proponent of the NCAA tournament. Four different Jayhawk head coaches are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches, Phog Allen, Larry Brown, Roy Williams, and current head coach Bill Self. Three different Division I basketball arenas have been named after former Kansas players, the Dean Smith Center named after Dean Smith at North Carolina, Rupp Arena named after Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, and the Jayhawks\u2019 own arena Allen Fieldhouse named after Phog Allen.\nIn 2008, ESPN ranked Kansas second on a list of the most prestigious programs of the modern college basketball era. Kansas currently has the longest streak of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances of all-time (28), the longest current streak of consecutive NCAA winning seasons (41), the most winning seasons in Division I history (105), the most non-losing seasons (.500 or better) in NCAA history (107), the most conference championships in Division I history (63), tied for the most consecutive regular-season conference titles in Division I (13), the most First-Team All-Americans in Division I history (24), and the most First-Team All-American selections in Division I history (31). As of the last complete season, the program ranks third in Division I all-time winning percentage (.729) and second in Division I all-time wins (2,393).\nSince the opening of Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks\u2019 home arena, in 1955, the Jayhawks have earned a well established home court advantage. Allen Fieldhouse is often considered one of the best home court advantages in college basketball. As of 2024, the Jayhawks have won over 87 percent of their games in the 69-year history of Allen Fieldhouse, losing just 118 games. Under current head coach Bill Self, the Jayhawks have had three home court winning streaks over 30 games and two over 50 games. In addition to Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks frequently play games at the nearby T-Mobile Center (formerly Sprint Center) in Kansas City, Missouri. These games, while technically a neutral site, are officially considered home games when not part of a tournament, the only exception being their games at the arena during their six-game series with rival Missouri.\n\nHistory\nKansas currently ranks second all-time in NCAA Division I wins with 2,357 wins (as of the last complete season), against 877 losses (.729 all time winning %, third all-time). This record includes a 765\u2013110 (.874) mark at historic Allen Fieldhouse. The Jayhawks are first in NCAA history with 98 winning seasons, and tied for first in NCAA history with 101 non-losing (.500 or better) seasons with Kentucky. Kansas is tied for the fewest head coaches (8) of any program that has played since the 19th century, yet has reached the Final Four under more head coaches (6) than any other program in the nation. Every head coach at Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament has led the program to the Final Four. Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 62 in 113 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2019\u201320 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 20 conference titles and a record 11 conference tournament titles in the 24 years of the Big 12's existence. The program also owns the best Big 12 records in both the regular season and the post season conference tournament, with a 412\u2013102 record in conference play and a 46\u201312 record in tournament play. The Jayhawks won their 2,000th game in school history when they defeated Texas Tech in the 2009\u20132010 season, joining the University of Kentucky and the University of North Carolina as the only schools to boast such an achievement at that time.\n\nJames Naismith era (1898\u20131907)\nThe men's basketball program officially began in 1898, following the arrival of Dr. James Naismith to the school, just six years after Naismith had written the sport's first official rules. Naismith was initially hired to be a chapel director and physical education instructor, but became the head basketball coach.\nThe Jayhawks played their first game on February 3, 1899, against the Kansas City YMCA, a game they lost 5\u201316. They would win their first game a week later on February 10 in a 31\u20136 victory over the Topeka YMCA. Their first intercollegiate game was played on March 23 against Haskell, a school about two miles southeast of the southeastern edge of the University of Kansas. They would finish their first season 7\u20134.\nDuring the programs early years, the majority of the university's basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams, with YMCAs across the nation having played an integral part in the birth of basketball. Other common opponents were Haskell and William Jewell. Under Naismith, the team began their rivalries with Kansas State, later deemed the Sunflower Showdown and Missouri, later deemed the Border War (officially changed to Border Showdown in 2004). Naismith was, ironically, the only coach in the program's history to have a losing record (55\u201360).\nIncluding his years as coach, Naismith served as the athletic director and a faculty member at Kansas for a total of almost 40 years before retiring in 1937. Naismith died in 1939, and his remains are buried in Lawrence, Kansas. The basketball court in Allen Fieldhouse is named James Naismith Court. Beyond inventing the game, his next greatest basketball legacy may be his coaching tree, whose two trunks are the well-known Phog Allen and Kansas native John McLendon. (McLendon attended KU in the 1930s when Allen was head coach.  Although McLendon tried out for the team, he never played for Allen. Naismith mentored McLendon from his arrival at Kansas through degree completion and beyond.)\nIn October 2010, lifelong Kansas basketball fan Josh Swade went on a mission to raise money to win James Naismith's original rules of basketball which were set for auction. Swade met Kansas alumnus David Booth who on December 10, 2010, purchased Dr. James Naismith's 13 Original Rules of the game at a Sotheby's auction in New York City for the sum of $4.3 million. The story was told in a documentary film called \"There's No Place Like Home,\" which was part of ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The founding document of basketball was brought back to KU's Lawrence campus, where it is currently housed at the DeBruce Center.\n\nPhog Allen/William O. Hamilton era (1907\u20131956)\nIn 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, Dr. Forrest C. \"Phog\" Allen as head coach. Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\" Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg and Ralph Miller (all except Lonborg were born and raised in Kansas). Allen coached the team from 1907 to 1909, but William O. Hamilton coached from 1909 to 1919, with Allen taking over again in 1919. The team went 125\u201359 and won five conference championships under Hamilton's direction.\nAllen coached KU for 39 seasons and amassed a record of 590\u2013219, with two retroactively-awarded Helms Foundation national titles and one NCAA Tournament championship in 1952. Numerous basketball greats would play at Kansas during Allen's era, including Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, Dutch Lonborg, and Ralph Miller (all future Hall of Fame coaches), Paul Endacott, Bill Johnson, and Clyde Lovellette (Hall of Fame players), two-time Olympic Gold Medalist Bill Hougland, and even former United States Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.\nIn 1952, the Jayhawks won the national title with an 80\u201363 victory in the final game over St. John's, coached by Frank McGuire. Clyde Lovellette of Kansas was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and is still the only player to lead the nation in scoring and lead his team to a national title in the same year. This tournament was the first to have a true \"Final Four\" format. Seven members of the championship team represented the United States in the 1952 Summer Olympics and brought home a gold medal for the national basketball team. This was especially poignant for Allen, as he had been the driving force for having basketball added to the Olympics in 1936.\nAllen was forced to retire when he turned 70 in 1956, because of a university policy requiring school employees to retire at 70. Allen had recruited legendary Wilt Chamberlain to Kansas, but would not get to coach him because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity basketball in 1956.\n\nDick Harp era (1956\u20131964)\nFollowing Allen's retirement, the Jayhawks hired former KU player and assistant, Dick Harp. Under Harp the Jayhawks went 121\u201382 with two conference titles and two NCAA tournament berths.\nWilt Chamberlain played his varsity years under Harp, making his job a rather easy one for the first two seasons. In his first varsity game, Chamberlain scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time college records in an 87\u201369 win against Northwestern. In 1957, he led the Jayhawks to the championship game against North Carolina, coached by Frank McGuire, whom they had defeated in the 1952 title game when McGuire was at St. John's. McGuire triple-teamed Chamberlain and, as a result, KU was defeated 54\u201353 in triple overtime. The game is considered one of the greatest in NCAA history. Chamberlain continued to average 30+ points per game until leaving KU early to play professionally with the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nTed Owens era (1964\u20131983)\nTed Owens took over for Harp in 1964, and would go 348\u2013128 during his tenure, eventually winning six Big Eight Conference titles.\nThe team advanced to NCAA postseason play seven times under Owens. The 1971 team went 27\u20133 and advanced to the Final Four before losing to UCLA. In 1974 the team went 23\u20137 and again advanced to the Final Four before losing to Marquette.\nDuring this era the program produced All-Americans such as Jo Jo White, Walt Wesley, Bud Stallworth, Darnell Valentine, and Dave Robisch.\nAfter 19 years of coaching at University of Kansas, Owens was fired following the 1982\u201383 season after the Jayhawks posted back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nLarry Brown era (1983\u20131988)\nIn 1983, Larry Brown headed to the University of Kansas, after coaching in the NBA. Under Brown, Kansas finished first in the Big Eight in 1986, and second in 1984, 1985, and 1987. In 1988, Kansas got off to a 12\u20138 start, including 1\u20134 in the Big 8.  The Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse was snapped with a loss to rival Kansas State, and they would also lose two more home games to Duke and Oklahoma. Behind the high-scoring of Danny Manning, KU finished 21\u201311 at the end of the season and entered the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed. Two early upsets allowed them to face lower seeds, gain momentum, and advance.  The Jayhawks would ultimately go on to face the three teams who had given them their three home losses that season.  They defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8, then defeated Duke in the Final 4, and won the national championship, defeating favored conference rival Oklahoma 83\u201379 in the final. The 11 losses Kansas accrued in 1988 are more than any other national champion have before or since. The win garnered the team the nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\". Earlier, near the start of the tournament, Dick Vitale had been asked about Kansas's chances and commented \"If Kansas wins, I'll kiss the Jayhawk on the floor of Allen Fieldhouse.\" Eventually, he did make good on his promise.\nDuring Brown's tenure, Kansas had five NCAA Tournament appearances, which included two second round appearances, one Sweet 16 appearance, two trips to the Final Four and the national championship. He also compiled a 135\u201344 (.754) overall record. Brown left under a cloud, as NCAA sanctions and a postseason probation were levied against Kansas following Brown's departure in the 1988\u20131989 season as a result of recruiting violations that took place during Brown's tenure. The major violation was a plane ticket home for potential transfer Vincent Askew to see his sick grandmother. Prior to the investigation, Askew had already decided not to transfer to Kansas.\n\nRoy Williams era (1988\u20132003)\nShortly following Brown's departure, Kansas hired then North Carolina assistant Roy Williams as head coach.\nFrom 1988 to 2003, under the direction of Williams, the Jayhawks had a record of 418\u2013101, a .805 winning percentage. Williams' Kansas teams averaged 27.8 wins per season. Except for his first season at Kansas (when the team was on probation), all of Williams' teams made the NCAA tournament. On Roy's first KU team Patrick Richey, Adonis Jordan and Richard Scott could not visit campus because of recruiting violations by Larry Brown, so they committed sight unseen. From 1990 to 1999 Kansas compiled a 286\u201360 record, giving them both the most wins and best winning percentage of any team in that decade. From 1994 to 1998, the Jayhawks won 62 consecutive home games at Allen Fieldhouse, which was the longest such streak in the NCAA at the time. The seniors of 1998 (Raef LaFrentz, Billy Thomas, and C.B. McGrath) went 58\u20130 at home during their KU careers.\nKansas won nine regular-season conference championships over Williams' last 13 years. In seven years of Big 12 Conference play, his teams went 94\u201318, capturing the regular-season title in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 and the postseason tournament crown in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2001\u201302, KU became the first, and so far only, team to go undefeated (16\u20130) in Big 12 play. From 1995 to 1998, Kansas was a combined 123\u201317 \u2013 an average of 30.8 wins per season.\nWilliams' teams went 201\u201317 (.922) in Allen Fieldhouse, and won 62 consecutive games in Allen from February 1994 to December 1998. Kansas was a regular in the Associated Press Top 25 from 1991 to 1999, placing in the poll for 145 consecutive weeks. Williams' teams were ranked in the Top 10 in 194 AP polls from 1990.\n\nKansas led the nation in field goal percentage and scoring in 2002 and in scoring margin in 2003, held opponents to the lowest field goal percentage in the country in 2001 (37.8 percent), and led the nation in winning percentage in 1997 and 2002. The team shot better than 50 percent from the floor for seven different seasons under Williams and led the country in field goal percentage in 1990 (53.3) and 2002 (50.6). Williams' teams shot a combined 49.4 percent from the floor during his tenure. Williams-coached teams led the nation in assists in 2001 and 2002 and were seventh in the nation in 2003; scored 100 or more points 71 times (once every 13 games); averaged 82.7 points per game over his 15 seasons as coach; and averaged 90 or more points per game in two seasons (92.1 in 1990 and 90.9 in 2002).\nThe Jayhawks were in the AP Top 25 in 242 of 268 weekly polls, reached the No. 1 ranking in the country in six different seasons, and reached at least No. 2 in the nation in 11 of William's 15 seasons as head coach at Kansas.\nUnder Williams, the team had several deep runs in the NCAA Tournament, making it to four Final Fours and appearing in the national championship game in both 1991 and 2003, losing both, to Duke and Syracuse respectively. Amidst the tournament successes, there were plenty of woes. The 1996\u201397 team was said by many to be one of the greatest teams in history, featuring future NBA players such as Paul Pierce, Jacque Vaughn, Raef LaFrentz, Greg Orstertag, and Scot Pollard. The team was upset in the Sweet Sixteen by the eventual champion, Arizona Wildcats.\nThe Jayhawks advanced to the Final Four in 2002 & 2003. Following the national championship loss in 2003, Williams left Kansas and returned to coach at his alma mater, North Carolina.\n\nBill Self era (2003\u2013present)\nBill Self was introduced as the new head coach for the 2003\u201304 season and in his first season at Kansas, Self inherited Williams' players and recruits, which often caused turmoil as the style of play differed between the two coaches. Nevertheless, Self led his new Kansas team to the Elite Eight at the NCAA tournament his first year.\nKU in 2004\u201305 was led by seniors Wayne Simien, Keith Langford, Michael Lee, and Aaron Miles. They began the season ranked #1 and started off 20\u20131, but then they slumped and lost six of their final nine games, including a loss to Bucknell in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The team finished 23\u20137 and settled for a Big 12 co-championship with Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2005\u201306, little was expected of the freshman/sophomore-dominated Jayhawks, and they began the season 10\u20136, including 1\u20132 in the Big 12. Although they did post a 73\u201346 win over Kentucky, they also saw the end of their 31-game winning streak over rival Kansas State with a 59\u201355 loss at Allen Fieldhouse, and two nights later blew a seven-point lead in the final 45 seconds of regulation en route to an 89\u201386 overtime loss at Missouri. But afterward, the Jayhawks matured rapidly, winning 15 of their final 17 games and avenging the losses to both Kansas State and Missouri. KU played as the #2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament in Dallas, and avenged an earlier loss to Texas with an 80\u201368 victory over the Longhorns in the final to clinch the tournament championship and the highlight win of the season. KU was handed a #4 seed for the NCAA Tournament but stumbled again in the first round with a loss to the Bradley Braves.\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Self led Kansas to the 2007 Big 12 regular-season championship with a 14\u20132 record, highlighted by beating the Kevin Durant-led Texas Longhorns in come-from-behind victories in the last game of the regular season and in the Big 12 Championship game. At the end of the regular season, Kansas stood at 27\u20134 and ranked #2 in the nation in both the AP and coaches' polls. Kansas received a number 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, but their tournament run ended in the Elite Eight with a loss to 2-seed UCLA.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Self's Kansas team began the season 20\u20130 until they suffered their first loss at rival Kansas State, their first loss at Kansas State since 1983. The 2008 Jayhawks won the Big 12 regular-season title and the Big 12 conference tourney. They received a number-one seeding in the NCAA tournament in the Midwest region. On March 30, 2008, Self led Kansas to a win in an Elite Eight game over upstart Davidson College. KU won by two, 59\u201357. The Jayhawks played overall number 1 tournament seed North Carolina in the semifinals, a team coached by former KU head man Roy Williams.  The Jayhawks opened the game with a 40\u201312 run over the first 12\u00bd minutes before finally defeating them 84\u201366.  On April 7, 2008, the Jayhawks triumphed over a one-loss Memphis team to claim the national title.  With only seconds on the clock, Sherron Collins drove the ball the length of the court and threaded a pass to Mario Chalmers, who connected on a deep three-pointer to force overtime. This shot would later come to be known as \"Mario's Miracle\" in a nod to 1988 championship nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\".  Kansas then outplayed Memphis in the overtime to win the NCAA Championship game, 75\u201368.  The Jayhawks finished the season with a 37\u20133 record, the winningest season in Kansas history.\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, despite losing seven of their top nine scorers and the entire starting line-up, the Jayhawks earned their 20th consecutive NCAA tournament bid after going 25\u20137 (14\u20132), winning the conference regular season title and extending their home winning streak to 41 straight at Allen Fieldhouse. On March 22, 2009, Kansas defeated Dayton, advancing to their 3rd consecutive Sweet 16 appearance. But the Jayhawks' season ended on March 27 when Michigan State came from behind in the final minute to defeat Kansas 67\u201362, ending their year at 27\u20138. Coach Self's record, after 6 seasons with the Jayhawks, was 169\u201340, an .809 percentage. After the season, Self was named National Coach of the Year by the Associated Press, CBS Sports' Chevrolet Award, USBWA (Henry Iba Award), and Sporting News.\nOn April 13, Sherron Collins and Cole Aldrich announced their intent to return for the 2009\u201310 season. On April 23, top high school recruit Xavier Henry made his commitment to play at Kansas in the fall, prompting ESPN to name the Jayhawks as \"the team to beat in 2009\u201310.\"  By the time the fall of 2009 arrived, Kansas was the unanimous preseason #1 team in all major publications. The Jayhawks finished the regular season with a 29\u20132 record and continue to hold the Division I record for the current consecutive home winning streak at 59 straight games in Allen Fieldhouse.  Kansas passed 2,000 all-time wins in the 2009\u201310 season, only the third school to do so (finishing the season with a total of 2,003 all-time victories). They won the Big 12 tournament on March 13, clinching their 21st consecutive NCAA tournament appearance, an active NCAA record. However, despite being named the overall #1 seed in the tournament, the Jayhawks fell in the second round to #9-seeded Northern Iowa, finishing the season at 33\u20133.\nRecruiting began immediately for the 2010\u201311 season, as Kansas landed the nation's top recruit Josh Selby in April.  By September 2010, both The Sporting News and Athlon Sports had ranked Kansas in their pre-season outlook as #4 overall and, along with ESPN's Joe Lunardi, were projected to become a #1 seed again in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, which they would again earn.  Blue Ribbon and the USA Today/ESPN coaches polls both placed Kansas at #7 in the pre-season poll. Josh Selby, became eligible and joined the Jayhawk line-up on December 18. On March 5, the Jayhawks beat Missouri 70\u201366 to clinch the Big 12 regular-season title for the 7th consecutive time and later went on to finish 29\u20132 during the regular season, ranked #2 in both the AP Poll and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll. Bill Self was named Big 12 Coach of the Year and Marcus Morris was named Big 12 Player of the Year.  The Jayhawks defeated 16 seed Boston University, 9 seed Illinois and 12 seed Richmond to reach their 3rd Elite Eight in the past 5 seasons before falling to 11 seed Virginia Commonwealth University in the quarterfinal game. During the season, Kansas moved past North Carolina as the 2nd winningest basketball program in history.\nAfter being considered the top team but falling short in both of the previous two seasons, Kansas lost six of their top 8 scorers for the 2011\u201312 season. The Jayhawks had to rebuild after winning seven straight Big 12 titles. Prior to the season, the NCAA declared that three of the Jayhawks top recruits were ineligible for the season, which included games against perennial powerhouse programs such as Kentucky, Duke, Ohio State, and Georgetown. Despite 7 games against top 10 ranked opponents, Kansas finished the regular season 26\u20135, earned their 8th consecutive Big 12 title, and advanced to their 14th Final Four in school history. The Jayhawks faced another 2 seed, the Ohio State Buckeyes, in the National Semifinals, and came back from a 13-point first-half deficit to win the game, 64\u201362. They then faced the Kentucky Wildcats, who had beaten the Louisville Cardinals on the other side of the bracket, in the championship game. Kansas lost to the Wildcats, 67\u201359.\nKansas entered the 2012\u201313 season with eight straight Big 12 titles in tow. They ended the season having won 107 of their last 109 games at home.  After scoring their ninth consecutive title and winning the Big 12 tournament championship by defeating rival Kansas State for the third time that season, KU set its sights on a sixth national title.  They were seeded #1 in the South bracket, defeating Western Kentucky and North Carolina before losing in overtime to Michigan 87\u201385 in the Sweet 16.\nWith star freshmen Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid on the roster, Kansas entered the 2013\u201314 season as the #5 team in the country. They started off well with five straight wins, including a victory over Duke in the Champions' Classic. However, the team went 4\u20134 over its next eight games, including back-to-back losses to Colorado and Florida and an ugly home loss to San Diego State. The team recovered from this rough stretch and began Big 12 play with seven straight wins, ultimately finishing 14\u20134 to win its 10th consecutive Big 12 title. A back injury to Joel Embiid, however, left the Jayhawks vulnerable on their interior defense, and they fizzled out at season's end with four losses in their final seven games, including a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals in Kansas City and an NCAA Tournament Round of 32 loss to Stanford to end the year. Kansas concluded the year 25\u201310, the first ten-loss season for Kansas since Roy Williams' 1999\u20132000 Jayhawks went 24\u201310.\nAfter the exodus of Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid to the NBA draft, the Jayhawks reloaded with freshmen Kelly Oubre Jr. and Cliff Alexander, the Jayhawks looked poised for another Big 12 season title, which would be their 11th straight. After a loss in the Champions Classic to Kentucky, the Jayhawks finished 11\u20132 in the non-conference. In what many regarded as the toughest conference in the nation (Big 12) the Jayhawks won their 11th straight title outright with a record of 13\u20135, having lost a strong post presence in Cliff Alexander due to an investigation by the NCAA of improper benefits being given to Alexander. Evidence never clearly materialized, but Alexander was held out and played his last game as a Jayhawk at Kansas State, where they lost by 7. They then lost in the Big 12 Championship game to Iowa State 70\u201366, and had a final record going into the tournament of 26\u20138. The Jayhawks were given a 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they ousted 15 seed New Mexico State by 19 points, but exited the tournament early at the hands of Wichita State by 13 points. Both Oubre Jr. and Alexander declared for the draft shortly after the conclusion of the NCAA tournament.\nThe 2015\u201316 Jayhawks, led by Perry Ellis and Frank Mason, won a 12th consecutive Big 12 title and won the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA South Region, the Jayhawks reached the Elite Eight, where they stumbled against #2 seed Villanova, the eventual national champions.\n\nIn 2016\u201317, behind the leadership of national player of the year Frank Mason, the Jayhawks won a 13th consecutive Big 12 title, tying UCLA's record for most consecutive conference titles. Although the team made an early exit from the Big 12 Tournament with a quarterfinal loss to TCU, the Jayhawks got the #1 seed in the NCAA Midwest Region. They dominated UC-Davis, Michigan State, and Purdue in their first three games, but ran into a buzzsaw against Oregon in the Elite Eight.\nThe 2017\u201318 Jayhawks lost a number of players to graduation, the NBA Draft, and transfer; but appeared to be poised for another spectacular season. Star freshman Billy Preston was sidelined by an NCAA inquiry into the financial picture surrounding his car, and ultimately left the team to play professional basketball in Europe. Kansas won its first seven games before losing in Kansas City to Washington and at home to Arizona State. Kansas would lose a total of three home games during the season, the most for any Bill Self-coached Kansas team, and the most since losing three home games in the 1998\u201399 season. The season bottomed out in early February with a home loss to Oklahoma State and a 16-point loss at Baylor. But Kansas rallied to win a 14th straight Big 12 title, breaking UCLA's record. Then they defeated West Virginia to win the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA Midwest Region, the Jayhawks defeated Penn, Seton Hall, Clemson, and Duke to reach Bill Self's third Final Four appearance and the program's 15th overall. However, they stumbled against Villanova for the second time in three years. As with their last outing, Villanova wound up as the college champions.  On October 11, 2023, the NCAA would rule that Kansas would vacate the 15 wins in which Silvio De Souza played during that season, Big 12 Tournament title, NCAA appearance and their Final Four appearance due NCAA violations.\nKansas played in the 2015 World University Games in South Korea as the United States representatives in July 2015. The Jayhawks went undefeated in the World University Games, winning the championship to give the United States its first gold medal in World University Games men's basketball since 2005. In August 2017, Self and the Jayhawks traveled to Italy to play four exhibition matches against local professional Italian teams.\nShortly before the 2019\u201320 season began the NCAA announced they had major NCAA violations stemming from their involvement in the 2017\u201318 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal putting their NCAA record consecutive tournament appearance streak in jeopardy.\nThe Jayhawks finished the 2019\u201320 regular season 28\u20133 and were unanimously ranked number one in the final regular season AP poll. The Jayhawks went undefeated against unranked teams, and their three losses came to ranked teams. The Jayhawks were a favorite to win the NCAA Tournament, but the tournament was cancelled on March 12, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe following season, the Jayhawks struggled early in the conference schedule. After eight games, they had a 4\u20134 conference record. At one point during conference play, they lost five of seven games which included a 3-game losing streak, a rarity under Self. They would finish the regular season the season winning seven of their last eight games, including a 71\u201358 defeat of number 2 ranked Baylor, who was undefeated going into the game. Kansas withdrew from the Big 12 tournament after a player tested positive for COVID-19. They qualified for the tournament, extending their NCAA record to 31 consecutive tournaments. They defeated Eastern Washington in the first round. The following round, they were beaten by USC 51\u201385, their worst NCAA Tournament loss in school history and one of the worst defeats in program history.\nOn April 2, 2021, Kansas signed Self to a lifetime contract. The contract will automatically add an extra year to every year he coaches until he retires or dies.\nThe 2021\u201322 team earned a number 1 seed in the 2022 NCAA tournament. They defeated Providence in the tournament to become the winningest program in the nation. They defeated Villanova in the Final Four. The Jayhawks defeated North Carolina 72\u201369 in the national championship game to win Self's second championship, and the team's fourth NCAA championship. In the championship game, they completed a 16-point comeback, including being down 40\u201325 at halftime, the largest in NCAA championship history.\n\nConference affiliations\nKansas has been affiliated with the following conferences:\n\n*While there is an active conference with the name Missouri Valley, it is officially and legally a separate entity from the MVIAA.\n\nRank in notable areas\nRanks and records listed in table do not include wins, championships, and appearances vacated by the NCAA in 2023.Current Official NCAA Records and Awards data.\n\nNotable games\nOn February 3, 1899, the Jayhawks, coached by James Naismith played their first game in program history.

They won the game against rival Kansas State, 77\u201367.\nIn the NCAA title game in 1957, Wilt Chamberlain and Kansas were defeated by the North Carolina Tar Heels 54\u201353 in triple overtime in what many consider to be the greatest NCAA Championship game ever played. Chamberlain was later named the NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player, the second to win the award and be a part of the losing team (Kansas's B.H. Born won the award in 1953).\nIn the 1966 Midwest Regional Finals, Kansas, the favored team to face Kentucky, played Texas Western. Texas Western got a controversial double overtime victory, 81\u201380. The would-be winning shot, a 35-footer, at the buzzer was made by All-American Jo Jo White at the end of the first overtime, but White was called for stepping on the sideline.  The game was featuredin the 2006 film Glory Road which is based on that season's Texas Western National Championship team.\nOn April 4, 1988, in the 50th NCAA Tournament National Championship game, Kansas defeated the heavily favored Oklahoma Sooners 83\u201379 to win its second NCAA Men's Basketball championship. Led by senior forward and Player of the Year Danny Manning, Kevin Pritchard, Milt Newton, Chris Piper and a roster of players who came to be known as \"The Miracles\" raced the Sooners to a 50\u201350 halftime tie that had the referees shaking their heads and smiling as they left the court.  Upon their return for the second half, Larry Brown convinced his Jayhawks that now that they proved they could run with the Sooners, they needed to slow the game down and take the Sooners out of their fast break offense.  The Sooners built a 5-point second half lead until the Kansas defense finally clamped down.  The Jayhawks, led by Manning (31 points, 18 rebounds, 5 steals, 2 blocked shots), caught up with them around the 11 minute mark.  The rest of the game was neck and neck, until Manning finally sealed the victory from the free throw line.\nOn December 9, 1989, AP #2 Kansas beat Kentucky 150\u201395 in Allen Fieldhouse. The 150 points scored by the Jayhawks set the school record for most points scored in a game, and the team's 80 first-half points set the record for most points scored in a half.\nOn January 27, 2003, Kansas defeated Texas 90\u201387 at Allen Fieldhouse behind a 24-point, 23-rebound performance by Nick Collison.  Upon Collison fouling out of the game, his effort moved longtime ESPN college basketball analyst Dick Vitale to give him a standing ovation, only the second time Vitale had ever done so. (the first being for David Robinson)  Both Kansas and Texas would make the Final Four that year.\nOn April 7, 2008, in the 2008 National Championship game, the Kansas Jayhawks defeated the Memphis Tigers 75\u201368 in a come from behind overtime victory to become the 2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament Champions. Mario Chalmers made a three-point shot with 2.1 seconds remaining, bringing the Jayhawks all the way back from a 60\u201351 deficit with two minutes remaining. The Jayhawks went 4\u20134 from the field, including 2\u20132 from 3-point range, and also went 2\u20132 from the line in the final 2 minutes.  The Jayhawks then continued their hot flurry by going 4\u20136 from the field in OT and 4\u20134 from the line, outscoring the Tigers 12\u20135 in overtime to capture their third NCAA title, and fifth overall, including the retroactively awarded Helms Foundation Championships for the 1922 and 1923 seasons. Chalmers finished with 18 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, and 4 steals, and was chosen the Most Outstanding Player at the Final Four, the fifth Jayhawk all-time to be selected Final Four MOP.\nOn January 15, 2011, Kansas celebrated its 69th consecutive home win (over Nebraska), the longest such Division I record since 1992 and the longest home winning streak in KU's history.  (The streak ended on January 22, 2011, with a loss at home to the Texas Longhorns.)\nOn February 25, 2012, the Jayhawks played their final conference game against their longtime rival, the Missouri Tigers. The Kansas Jayhawks came back from a 19-point deficit in the second half to take the team to an 87\u201386 overtime win against the Tigers. The volume level inside the arena was a sustained 120 dB, with a high point of 127 dB when Thomas Robinson blocked Phil Pressey's shot at the end of regulation to preserve the tie.\nOn January 4, 2016, the Jayhawks, who were ranked 1st in the AP poll and 2nd in the coaches poll, played Oklahoma, who was ranked 2nd in the AP poll and 1st in the coaches poll. The game was back and forth the last few minutes of regulation. The game eventually went to 3 overtimes, and KU won 109\u2013106. Kansas forward Perry Ellis scored 27 points and got 13 rebounds while Oklahoma guard Buddy Hield scored 46 points. The game was the first time in Big 12 history that a conference game featured the number 1 ranked team and the number 2 ranked team.\nOn February 27, 2016, the Jayhawks won their 12th consecutive Big 12 regular season championship with a 67\u201358 win at home against Texas Tech.

The game featured two of the top college basketball programs in the nation with a Hall of Fame coach on both sidelines with Bill Self and Mike Krzyzewski. The game was a back and forth game that had 18 lead changes and 11 ties. Senior guard Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk made a 3 pointer with 25.7 seconds left to tie the game at 72. Duke guard Grayson Allen missed the potential game winning shot as time expired and the game went into overtime. Kansas guard Malik Newman scored all 13 of the Jayhawks points in overtime to help them win 85\u201381 earning KU their first Final Four trip since 2012. The win was later officially vacated by the NCAA.\nWhen the Jayhawks defeated North Carolina in the 2022 National Championship game, they completed the largest comeback in National Championship game history. They were down by as much as 16 points in the first half and were down 25\u201340 at halftime and won 72\u201369.\n\nCoaches\nDespite having a program for over 120 years, the Jayhawks have only had 8 head coaches. Four of their coaches have been inducted to the Hall of Fame as a coach. The longest tenured coach was Phog Allen at 39 seasons, while the shortest tenured coach was Larry Brown, who coached for 5 seasons. Bill Self, the current head coach, is the winningest coach in team history with 591. Allen is the next closest to Self with 590 wins. Ted Owens is the only coach in program history to have been fired. Allen and Harp are the only Jayhawk coaches to have also played at the school. Self had his first coaching job as an assistant under Brown at Kansas.\nOf programs who have been around for at least 100 years, Kansas has had the fewest coaches, yet they have been led to the Final Four by more coaches than any other program.  Every coach that has coached Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament in 1939 has led the team to a Final Four.  Phog Allen, Dick Harp, Ted Owens, Larry Brown,  Roy Williams, and  Bill Self have all led Kansas to NCAA Final Four appearances. Of those coaches, Allen, Brown, and Bill Self have led the Jayhawks to NCAA Championships (in 1952, 1988, 2008, and 2022 respectively). In addition to an NCAA Tournament National Championship, Allen won two retroactively awarded Helms Athletic Foundation National Championships for the 1922 and 1923 seasons. Allen and Self are the only coaches to win multiple National Championships of any kind, while Self is the only one to win multiple NCAA Tournament National Championships.\nWhile officially only having had eight coaches in program history, the Jayhawks also had three interim coaches who are not considered an official part of the coaching history. In 1919, Karl Schlademan coached, and won, the first game of the season before relinquishing the coaching position to Allen in order to concentrate on his duties as head track coach. In 1947, Howard Engleman coached 14 games (going 8\u20136) after Allen was ordered to take a rest following the 13th game of the season. Engleman's record is not listed in this table as he was never officially a head coach at the university. Assistant coach Norm Roberts served as acting head coach for the beginning of the 2022\u201323 season while Bill Self served a 4-game suspension for alleged recruiting violations. He served as the acting head coach again for Kansas in the Big 12 and NCAA Tournaments while Bill Self was away from the team following a heart procedure. Each of these coaches have every one of their wins counted in their career records in the NCAA record books. The only exception is Roberts, who only has 4 wins early in the season counted, instead the 4 wins and 2 losses in the postseason; those 4 wins and 2 losses are counted in Self's career coaching record.\n\n*Allen was forced to retire prior to the 1956\u201357 season due to a University of Kansas policy that required university employees to retire at the age of 70; he turned 70 in November of 1955.\u2020Naismith is inducted in the Hall of Fame as the inventor of the game, not as a coach.\u2021Does not include 15 wins, 1 regular season Conference Championship, 1 Conference Tournament Championship, and 1 Final Four appearance vacated by the NCAA.\nUpdated March 20, 2023\n\nFacilities\nSince first fielding a program, the Jayhawks have had three official home arenas. Kansas also occasionally will play regular season games at the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\n\nEarly venues (1898\u20131907)\nBefore 1907 the Jayhawks played in various venues, ranging from the basement of the original Snow Hall (even though the ceiling was only 14 feet high) to the skating rink at the local YMCA. Although a current campus building bears the same name, the original Snow Hall was demolished in 1934.\n\nRobinson Gymnasium (1907\u20131927)\nRobinson Gym was the first athletic building on the KU campus and featured a 2,500-seat auditorium used for basketball purposes. The building was demolished in 1967.\n\nHoch Auditorium (1927\u20131955)\nHoch Auditorium was a 3,500 seat multi-purpose arena in Lawrence, Kansas. It opened in 1927. It was home to the University of Kansas Jayhawks basketball teams until Allen Fieldhouse opened in 1955.\nMany of Hoch's nicknames during the basketball years were \"Horrible Hoch\" and \"The House of Horrors.\" Such nicknames were in reference to the difficulty opposing teams had in dealing with the tight area surrounding the court and the curved walls and decorative lattice work directly behind the backboards. The curvature of the walls made the backboards appear to be moving causing opponents to miss free throws.\nOn June 15, 1991, Hoch Auditorium was struck by lightning. The auditorium and stage area were completely destroyed. Only the limestone facade and lobby area were spared. When reconstruction of the building was complete, the rear half of the building was named Budig Hall, for then KU Chancellor Gene Budig. The name on the facade was altered to reflect the presence of three large auditorium-style lecture halls within the building: Hoch Auditoria.\n\nAllen Fieldhouse (1955\u2013present)\nAllen Fieldhouse was dedicated on March 1, 1955, when the Jayhawks defeated in-state rival, Kansas State 77\u201367.\nSince February 20, 1994, the Jayhawks have lost only 14 regular season games in Allen Fieldhouse, a 263\u201314 record (.951). Since February 3, 2007, the Jayhawks have gone 227\u20139 (.962) at Allen Fieldhouse, as of April 17, 2021, one of the best home record in all of basketball.\nAllen Fieldhouse is also notorious for its noise level as well. On November 4, 2010, ESPN The Magazine named Allen Fieldhouse the loudest college basketball arena in the country, reaching sustained decibel levels over 120. On February 13, 2017, in a game against Big 12 opponent West Virginia, fans at Allen Fieldhouse broke the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar at an indoor sporting event with a roar of 130.4 decibels, which had been set by Kentucky on January 28 against Kansas.\nIn the DeBruce Center at the northeast corner of the building is the original document of the Dr. Naismith's Original 13 Rules Of Basketball, purchased at auction by the Booth family for $4.3 million on December 10, 2010.\nKansas won 69 consecutive games at the Fieldhouse between February 3, 2007, and January 17, 2011, until Texas ended the longest streak in NCAA Division I since 1992 with a 74\u201363 win against Kansas on January 22, 2011. This streak broke Kansas's previous school record of 62, which lasted from February 26, 1994, through December 18, 1998 (during which time, the Jayhawks, along with the remaining members of the Big Eight Conference merged with the remaining members of the Southwest Conference to become charter members of the Big 12 Conference). The Jayhawks also completed a 55-game streak between February 22, 1984, through January 30, 1988, which is a Big 8 record.\n\nHome game traditions\nBefore the start of every Jayhawks home game, after the singing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", it is a tradition to sing the alma mater, \"Crimson and the Blue\". While singing the alma mater, it is tradition for the students in attendance to put an arm over the shoulders of their neighbors and slowly sway side to side, lifting their arms over their heads as the last line of the song is sung. The song is concluded by the Rock Chalk Chant.\nPost-game, the band will play a rendition of the Kansas state song \"Home on the Range\", which the crowd will stand up for similar to the national anthem.\nAfter singing The Star-Spangled Banner, while the opposing team is being introduced, members of the student section take out a copy of the student-run newspaper, The University Daily Kansan, and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in the opposing team. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.\nIf an opposing player fouls out of the game, the fans will \"wave the wheat\", waving their arms back and forth, as a sarcastic good-bye to the disqualified player, to the tune of \"You Didn't Have Your Wheaties\", from a series of 1970s television commercials promoting Wheaties breakfast cereal. The same waving motion to the tune of \"A Hot Time in the Old Town\" follows a Jayhawk victory.\nIf the Jayhawks are leading comfortably near the end of the game, the crowd begins a slow version of the Rock Chalk Chant, which has become the signature tradition of Allen Fieldhouse. The chant can also occasionally be heard at neutral sites, such as arenas for the NCAA tournament and the nearby T-Mobile Center on the Missouri side of Kansas City which during the regular season serves as an alternate home arena.\nFans and students will also line up early for Late Night In The Phog, which is the first practice of the season. The practice is viewable to the public and includes skits with past players as the hosts.\n\nYear-by-year Results\nRivalries\nKansas State\nThe Jayhawks longest played rivalry is with cross-state rival Kansas State. The Jayhawks lead the series 203\u201394. The Jayhawks have dominated the series since 1984 holding a record of 86\u201312 in that time frame. K-State has not led the all-time series since 1922. The schools have met annually since 1912 and first played in 1907. Kansas leads in Lawrence 93\u201335, in Manhattan 81\u201348, and on neutral courts 29\u201311. The Largest K-State victory was by 27 points, 96\u201369, on January 20, 1979. The largest Kansas win was 45 points, 90\u201345, on March 10, 1955. K-State longest win streak was 5 games, which they achieved twice, from 1972 to 1974 and 1982\u201383. The longest winning streak from Kansas was 31 games from 1994 to 2005.\n\nMissouri\nThe Jayhawks main rival has been Missouri for many years. The two teams first played in 1907. The two teams played every year until Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC. The schools renewed the rivalry beginning in the 2021\u201322 season. The Jayhawks won the first game in the renewal of the rivalry 102\u201365. KU leads the all-time series 174\u201394. The Jayhawks largest victory was 47 points, 96\u201349, on December 28, 1977. Missouri's largest victory was 30 points, 99\u201369, on January 17, 1976. The Jayhawks longest winning streak was 14 games from 1910 to 1913. Missouri's longest winning streak was 9 from 1920 to 1922.\n\nWichita State\nWhile not officially a rivalry, the Jayhawks have played cross-state opponent Wichita State 16 times. The teams most recently met in the 2023\u201324 season with KU winning 86\u201367. Kansas leads the all-time series 13\u20133. The Jayhawks' largest victory was a 49-point win in 1993. The Shockers' largest victory was a 14-point win in the second round of the 2015 NCAA Tournament. Wichita State has never won consecutive games against Kansas. The Jayhawks won five times in a row from 1989 to 1993. Wichita State won both games between the schools in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nPost-season results\nRegular season conference championships\nThe Jayhawks have won 62 conference championships since their inception, including an NCAA record 13 consecutive from 2005 through 2017. The Jayhawks have belonged to the Big 12 Conference since it formed before the 1996\u201397 season. Before that, the Jayhawks have belonged to the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association from the 1907\u201308 to 1927\u201328 seasons, the Big Six Conference from 1928\u201329 to 1946\u201347, the Big Seven Conference from 1947\u201348 to 1957\u201358, the Big Eight Conference from 1958 to 1959 up until the end of the 1995\u201396 season. The Big Six and Big Seven conferences were actually the more often used names of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which existed under that official name until 1964, when it was changed to the Big Eight.\nMissouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (13)\n\n1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912, 1914, 1915, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927\nBig 6/7/8 Conference (30)\n\n1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1946, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1957, 1960, 1966, 1967, 1971, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1986, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996\nBig 12 Conference (20)\n\n1997, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, 2023\n*Vacated by the NCAA and not included in the count.\n\nConference tournament championships\nThe Big Eight Conference did not regularly have a post-season tournament until after the 1977 season. Prior to that teams usually played in the Big Eight (before that, Big Seven) Holiday Tournament in December. The Holiday tournament ended after the 1979 season.\nBig Seven/Big Eight Holiday Tournament (13)\n\n1951, 1953, 1956, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1974, 1977, 1978\nBig Eight Conference (4)\n\n1981, 1984, 1986, 1992\nBig 12 Conference (11)\n\n1997, 1998, 1999, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018*, 2022\n*Vacated by the NCAA and not included in the count.\n\nNCAA Tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA started seeding teams with the 1978 tournament, with the seeding format used today beginning in 1979. The Jayhawks were seeded for the first time in their 1981 tournament appearance.

The Helms titles were awarded retroactively by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1943. Some schools do not claim Helms championships, Kansas, however, does claim them and has a banner hanging for both in Allen Fieldhouse, along with their NCAA Tournament championships.\n\nHelms Athletic Foundation Championships\n1921-22\nHead Coach: Phog Allen\nRecord: 16-2\n1922-23\nHead Coach: Phog Allen\nRecord: 17-1\n\nNCAA Tournament National Championships\n1952\nThe Jayhawks 1951\u201352 team won the schools first NCAA Tournament Championship. They were coached by Phog Allen and finished the season with a 28\u20133 record.\n\n1988\nThe 1987\u201388 team won the Jayhawks second NCAA Tournament championship. The Jayhawks were coached by Larry Brown. They finished the season 27\u201311, which is the lowest winning percentage (.710) and most losses of any team to win the national championship. The team remains the only championship team of the Jayhawks that did not win the regular season conference championship or the conference tournament championship.\n\n2008\nThe 2007\u201308 team won the Jayhawks third NCAA Tournament Championship. They were coached by Bill Self and finished the season with a 37\u20133 record, which is a school record for wins in a season.\n\n2022\nThe 2021\u201322 team won the Jayhawks fourth NCAA Tournament Championship, which is their most recent championship. They were coached by Bill Self and finished the season with a 34\u20136 record. The Jayhawks tournament run in 2022 is the only one since teams began being seeded that they did not play a single number 1 seed in the Final Four and National Championship game.\n\nComplete NCAA tournament results\nThe Jayhawks have appeared in the NCAA tournament 52 times. Their combined record is 117\u201351. Their largest victory in a tournament game was a 58-point (110\u201352) victory over Prairie View A&M in 1998, which is also the Jayhawks tournament record for most points scored in a tournament game. Their largest defeat in a tournament game was a 34-point defeat (51\u201385) against USC in 2021, which was also their lowest point total in the NCAA tournament total since the introduction of the shot clock in the 1985\u201386 season. They have been eliminated in the first round only seven times since the beginning of the tournament, only three of those times have been since the tournament expanded to 64 teams. The Jayhawks have played in 11 overtime games in the NCAA Tournament and have a 6\u20135 record. Two of their overtime games went into multiple overtimes, both of which have been depicted in a film. Their 3 overtime game against North Carolina in the 1957 National Championship game was depicted in the film Jayhawkers and their double overtime loss to Texas Western in the 1966 Elite Eight, which was featured in the 2006 film Glory Road.\nOnly four times in program history has Kansas failed to win a single game in the tournament and only twice since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985.\nLike most schools, Kansas rarely plays conference opponents in the tournament. The 1988 tournament was the only time they've ever played conference opponents. In that tournament they defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8 and Oklahoma in the national championship game.\nAppearances are grouped by the number of teams in the bracket. Round names are based on what round names were at the time of the tournament, not the present names. The term \"Elite eight\" began in 1956, \"Final four\" began in 1975, and \"Sweet Sixteen\" began in 1988.\n\nEight team tournament\n\nSixteen to Thirty-two team tournament\n\nForty to Fifty-three teams\n\nSixty-four teams\n\nSixty-five teams\n\nFirst four era\n\n*Following the introduction of the First Four round in 2011, the Round of 64 and Round of 32 were referred to as the Second Round and Third Round, respectively, from 2011 to 2015, then from 2016 moving forward, the Round 64 and Round of 32 will be called the First and Second rounds.\u2020NCAA vacated all NCAA Tournament wins from the 2018 tournament, which included their Final Four appearance.\n\nRecord by round\n\n*Since its inception in 2011, Kansas has not participated in the First Four\u2020Round no longer played\u2021Round does not include a win vacated by the NCAA in 2023.\n\nNIT results\nThe Jayhawks have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) two times. Their combined record is 3\u20132.\n\nJayhawks of note\nAll-time leaders\nNo players appear in all three lists. Five players make two appearances.

One former announcer, Max Falkenstien, is honored with the retired jerseys as well. His number 60 was chosen because that was the number of years he was the radio announcer for the Jayhawks. Charlie T. Black and Paul Endacott are the only two players with their jerseys retired to play on two championship teams. Four players from the 2008 Championship have their jersey retired, which is the most players honored to be on a roster in any single season in Kansas basketball history.\n\nNotes\n\nJayhawks in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\nTwenty members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame have been associated with the Kansas men's basketball team.

    "summary": "The Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball program is the intercollegiate men's basketball program of the University of Kansas. The program is classified in the NCAA's Division I and the team competes in the Big 12 Conference. Kansas is renowned for having one of the most prestigious and historic intercollegiate basketball programs in North America. In the United States, Kansas has six overall national championships (4 NCAA Tournament National Championships and 2 Helms National Championships), as well as being runner-up six times and having the most conference titles in the nation.\nThe Jayhawks own the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances with 28 consecutive appearances. Since the 1984 tournament, the Jayhawks have only missed the tournament twice due to disciplinary action from the NCAA; they were ruled ineligible for the 1989 tournament and 2018 being vacated. They have not missed the tournament strictly due to on the court performance since the 1983 tournament. They were also, along with Dartmouth, the first team to appear in multiple NCAA Tournaments after making their second appearance in the 1942 tournament. The Jayhawks had been ranked in the AP poll for 231 consecutive polls, a streak that had stretched from the poll released on February 2, 2009, through the poll released on February 8, 2021, which is the longest streak in AP poll history. Of the 28 seasons the Big 12 conference has been in existence, Kansas has won at least a share of 21 regular-season conference titles.\nThe Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of basketball, James Naismith. Naismith, ironically, is the only coach in Kansas basketball history with a losing record. The Kansas basketball program has produced many notable professional players, including Clyde Lovellette, Wilt Chamberlain, Jo Jo White, Danny Manning, Raef LaFrentz, Paul Pierce, Nick Collison, Kirk Hinrich, Mario Chalmers, Andrew Wiggins, and Joel Embiid. Politician Bob Dole also played basketball at Kansas. Former players that have gone on to be coaches include Phog Allen, Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg, and former assistants to go on to be notable coaches include John Calipari, Gregg Popovich, and Bill Self. Mark Turgeon, Jerod Haase, Danny Manning, and Tad Boyle are all former players and assistant coaches that became head coaches. Allen founded the National Association of Basketball Coaches and, with Lonborg, was an early proponent of the NCAA tournament. Four different Jayhawk head coaches are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches, Phog Allen, Larry Brown, Roy Williams, and current head coach Bill Self. Three different Division I basketball arenas have been named after former Kansas players, the Dean Smith Center named after Dean Smith at North Carolina, Rupp Arena named after Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, and the Jayhawks\u2019 own arena Allen Fieldhouse named after Phog Allen.\nIn 2008, ESPN ranked Kansas second on a list of the most prestigious programs of the modern college basketball era. Kansas currently has the longest streak of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances of all-time (28), the longest current streak of consecutive NCAA winning seasons (41), the most winning seasons in Division I history (105), the most non-losing seasons (.500 or better) in NCAA history (107), the most conference championships in Division I history (63), tied for the most consecutive regular-season conference titles in Division I (13), the most First-Team All-Americans in Division I history (24), and the most First-Team All-American selections in Division I history (31). As of the last complete season, the program ranks third in Division I all-time winning percentage (.729) and second in Division I all-time wins (2,393).\nSince the opening of Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks\u2019 home arena, in 1955, the Jayhawks have earned a well established home court advantage. Allen Fieldhouse is often considered one of the best home court advantages in college basketball. As of 2024, the Jayhawks have won over 87 percent of their games in the 69-year history of Allen Fieldhouse, losing just 118 games. Under current head coach Bill Self, the Jayhawks have had three home court winning streaks over 30 games and two over 50 games. In addition to Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks frequently play games at the nearby T-Mobile Center (formerly Sprint Center) in Kansas City, Missouri. These games, while technically a neutral site, are officially considered home games when not part of a tournament, the only exception being their games at the arena during their six-game series with rival Missouri.",

    "biography": "The Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team represents Kansas State University in college basketball competition. The program is classified in the NCAA Division I, and is a member of the Big 12 Conference. The head coach is Jerome Tang. \nThe program began competition in 1902. The first two major-conference regular season titles won by the school were won by the men's basketball team, in 1917 and 1919 (in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association). Kansas State has gone on to win 19 regular season conference crowns. The Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA tournament 32 times, most recently in 2023. Kansas State's best season finish came in 1951, losing the national final to Kentucky. Jeff Sagarin listed the program 27th in his all-time rankings in the ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia. Following the 2024-25 season, the Wildcats have a record of 1,752-1,254.\n\nHistory\nKansas State University has appeared in 32 NCAA basketball tournaments, most recently in 2023. The team's all-time record in the NCAA tournament is 39\u201335 (.527). Kansas State's best finish at the tournament came in 1951, when it lost to Kentucky in the national championship game. The school has reached the Final Four 4 times, the Elite Eight 14 times, and the Sweet Sixteen 18 times.  Included among K-State's tournament wins are some all-time classics, including an 83\u201380 win over Oscar Robertson's Cincinnati team in 1958, which Sports Illustrated called \"the most exciting game of the 1958 season,\" and a 50\u201348 win over second-ranked Oregon State in 1981, which USA Today listed as one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history.\nThe team also had some notably successful seasons before the creation of the NIT (1938) and the NCAA tournament (1939), including conference titles in 1917 and 1919 under coach Zora Clevenger.  The Helms Athletic Foundation named Frank Reynolds the program's first All-American player in 1917, and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll retroactively ranked Kansas State #12 in 1910, #18 in 1916, #8 in 1917 and #7 in 1919.\n\nThe best season in the school's history may have been 1959, when the team finished the season ranked #1 in the final Associated Press poll and Coaches poll. K-State has finished ranked in the Top 10 of one of the two polls on eleven total occasions (most recently in 2023), and in the final top 25 polls 22 total times. The team has also posted a winning record at home every year since 1946.\nAfter a lengthy period with little success during the 1990s and 2000s, the team returned to prominence under head coach Frank Martin. Following a twelve-year absence, the team returned to the NCAA tournament after the 2007\u201308 season.  Following that season, Kansas State freshman Michael Beasley was named an All-American and Big 12 Conference Player of the Year. In the 2009\u201310 season, the team spent much of the year ranked in the Top 10 of the AP poll and finished second in the Big 12. The team received a #2 seed in the 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight. Along the way, the Wildcats defeated Xavier in a double-overtime thriller, which CBSSports.com called \"one of the best games in the history of the Sweet 16.\"\n\nOn March 31, 2012, Bruce Weber was announced as head coach after Frank Martin left for South Carolina. During the 2012\u20132013 season, Weber's first in Manhattan, Kansas State won its first regular season conference title since 1977 and advanced to the NCAA tournament. Weber's team won the conference title again in the 2018\u20132019 season. K-State appeared in the NCAA tournament five times in Weber's seven seasons, including advancing to the Elite Eight in 2018.\nAfter three consecutive losing seasons, Weber resigned under pressure in March 2022. He was succeeded by longtime Baylor assistant coach Jerome Tang. In Tang's first season, he guided a KSU team picked to finish last in the Big 12 to a third-place finish and to the NCAA Tournament, the first NCAA appearance since 2019. With wins over Montana State, Kentucky, and Michigan State, Tang brought the Wildcats to its first Elite Eight appearance since 2018 and its fourteenth Elite Eight appearance in program history.\n\nAchievements\nKansas State has a total of 36 All-Americans, 19 regular-season conference championships and nine conference tournament championships.\nThe program ranks in the top 25 nationally in the following categories:\n\nThe program also ranks in the top 50 nationally in the following categories:\n\nTop 25 rankings\nKansas State University has finished in the final rankings of the AP poll or Coaches poll on 22 occasions throughout its history, including one season at #1 in the final polls (pre-NCAA Tournament). The AP poll first appeared in 1948, and has been published continuously since 1950\u201351. The Coaches poll began in the 1950\u201351 season. Currently, the final AP poll is released before the tournament and the final Coaches poll is released after the tournament.\n\nRivalries\nKansas: Sunflower Showdown\nKansas State's main rivalry is with the Kansas Jayhawks. The rivalry peaked in the 1950s when both teams were annually national title contenders. The 1987\u201388 season also proved to be momentous in the rivalry. In the first matchup of the season, on January 30, 1988, Mitch Richmond scored 35 points to lead Kansas State to a 72\u201361 win to halt KU's then-record 55-game home winning streak. On February 18, KU turned the tables, prevailing 64\u201363 at Ahearn Field House in Manhattan to deny K-State a victory over KU in the old field house's last year. In what was supposed to be the rubber game, in the 1988 Big Eight Conference men's basketball tournament, Kansas State won a decisive victory by a 69\u201354 score. However, the biggest was yet to come. Both teams qualified for the NCAA tournament, and after three wins each in the tournament they faced each other on March 27 in Pontiac, Michigan, for the right to advance to the Final Four. Led by Danny Manning's 20 points, KU turned a tight game into a runaway and prevailed 71\u201358. Kansas would go on to win the national championship.\nThe rivalry slipped in significance after the 1988 season, and from 1994 to 2005 KU won 31 straight games against K-State, the longest streak for either school in the series.  KU also posted a 24-game win streak against the Wildcats in Manhattan, which ended on January 30, 2008, when #22 Kansas State upset #2 Kansas 84\u201375.\nJeff Sagarin's rankings of the nation's top programs by decade in the ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia nicely track the history of the rivalry. In the 1950s, when the rivalry was at its peak, Kansas State finished the decade ranked as the #3 program in the nation and KU was ranked as #4. In the 1960s KU was ranked #9 for the decade and KSU was ranked #11. In the 1970s, the programs were again nearly even, with Kansas State ranked at #24 and KU at #25. In the 1980s some separation appeared, as KU finished the decade ranked at #19 and Kansas State at #31. The big difference appeared in the 1990s and 2000s when KU was ranked at #4 and #2 for the decades, while Kansas State does not appear anywhere in the top 40.\nThe rivalry has become more relevant again in recent years, with both teams ranked in the AP Top 25 for many of their match-ups.\n\nMissouri\nAs of the 2022\u201323 season, Missouri is Kansas State's second most-played rival, with 237 games dating back to 1907. Kansas State leads the series 121\u2013116. The series was last played regularly in the 2011\u201312 season, before Missouri moved to the Southeastern Conference. For nearly a century beforehand, the two schools shared conferences, beginning in the 1913\u201314 season in the Missouri Valley Conference, then in the Big Eight Conference and its predecessors from 1928 to 1996, and finally the Big 12 Conference from 1996 to 2012.\nSince Missouri's move to the SEC, the two teams have matched up twice, meeting on neutral floors in 2015 and 2018, both Kansas State victories.\n\nWichita State\nKansas State had an ongoing in-state, out-of-conference rivalry with Wichita State, dating back to 1932 and last played in 2022. Kansas State leads the series 22\u201311. The series had six games from 1932 to 1964, then six games on a home-and-home rotation from the 1969\u201370 to 1971\u201372 seasons, and most recently 19 home-and-home games every season from 1985\u201386 to 2003\u201304.\nWhen Wichita State became a Top 25 regular in the early 2010s, there came interest in reviving the series. In February 2013, Kansas state senator Michael O'Donnell introduced a bill requiring Kansas and Kansas State to schedule Wichita State.\nThe series was renewed in 2021, with a four-game series calling for games at Intrust Bank Arena in Wichita that year, at Bramlage Coliseum in 2022, T-Mobile Center in Kansas City in 2023, and finally at Charles Koch Arena in 2024.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA tournament 32 times. Their overall record in the NCAA Tournament is 40\u201336 (.526) through the 2023 tournament.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2015 the round of 64 was known as the Second round, round of 32 was Third Round\n\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nNIT results\nThe Wildcats have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) seven times.

  "Kent State Golden Flashes": {
    "biography": "The Kent State Golden Flashes men's basketball team represents Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, United States. The Golden Flashes compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level as a member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) East Division. The team was founded in 1913 and played their first intercollegiate game in January 1915. They joined the Mid-American Conference in 1951 and have played in the East division since the MAC went to the divisional format in 1997. Home games are held at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, which opened in 1950 and is one of the oldest arenas in college basketball. Rob Senderoff was hired as head coach in 2011, the 24th coach in the program's history.\nThe Flashes gained national attention in the late 1990s and early 2000s after earning their first bid to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 1999. Two years later, Kent State picked up their first tournament win, followed the next year by their run to the Elite Eight in  2002 as a 10th seed where the Flashes finished the season ranked 12th nationally. The 2002 Golden Flashes also set a team record with 30 wins along with a MAC single-season record of 17 conference wins. \nKent State has made seven total appearances in the NCAA tournament, most recently in 2023, along with eight appearances in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), and six in the CollegeInsider.com Tournament (CIT) and its successor The Basketball Classic (TBC).  In MAC play, the Flashes have six regular-season titles, nine East division titles, and seven MAC tournament championships.\n\nHistory\nThe men's basketball team is Kent State's oldest collegiate team, founded in 1913 during the first fall semester at the new Kent State Normal School campus. The team was organized, though only five men were enrolled out of the initial enrollment of 140 at the beginning of the term, as the new school was a teacher training college and thus had a predominately female student body. More men would arrive at the school in the coming weeks. They played and won their first game against Kent High School and competed against local company and high school teams for that first season, going 7\u20132. During the following season, Kent State played its first intercollegiate game, a 56\u20136 loss to Otterbein College, on January 22, 1915. An additional intercollegiate game, a 54\u201318 home loss to Muskingum College, was played that year along with three other games against local teams. Kent State's first intercollegiate win was recorded March 10, 1916, a 27\u201317 home win over Ashland College, played in the former heating plant and manual training building. A shortage of men during both World Wars prevented teams from being formed for the 1917\u201318, 1918\u201319, and 1943\u201344 seasons. Beginning in 1932, Kent State played as a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference before joining the Mid-American Conference and beginning league play in 1951. Kent State was placed in the East Division when the MAC went to a divisional alignment in 1997.\nDuring their first years of existence, a variety of different venues were used for home games including on-campus facilities at what is now Cartwright Hall and the old heating plant, as well as off-campus facilities at the local Congregational Church gymnasium and Theodore Roosevelt High School, until Wills Gymnasium opened in 1925.  In 1950, the team moved to their current home, the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, known originally as the Men's Physical Education Building until 1956 and later as Memorial Gym until 1992.\nThe team played in relative anonymity for most of its existence.  They made their first appearance in the MAC tournament championship game (which began in 1980) in 1984, losing a close 42\u201340 game.  They would make the title game again in 1987 and 1989, losing both 64\u201363 and 67\u201365 respectively.  The Flashes made their first post-season appearance in the 1985 National Invitation Tournament, losing in the first round.  They returned to the NIT in 1989 and 1990, losing in the first round both times.\n\nBeginnings of success\nIn 1996, Gary Waters was hired as head coach and began to build what would become the longest run of success in Mid-American Conference history.  In 1999 the Flashes won over 20 games and defeated the Miami RedHawks in the MAC tournament championship game in Toledo to win their first MAC tournament title and make their first-ever NCAA tournament appearance, where they were defeated by Temple in the opening round at FleetCenter in Boston.  The following season, the Flashes again won over 20 games and finished second in the MAC East, but failed to win the conference tournament and received their first NIT invitation since 1990.  The Flashes hosted the first-round game against Rutgers and recorded their first-ever post-season win, a 73\u201362 victory.  Kent State would win their second-round match-up at Villanova before falling in the quarterfinals at Penn State.  The 2000\u20132001 season saw the Flashes win their first-ever MAC East title and their second tournament title to return to the NCAA tournament.  The experience in the NIT proved to be valuable as Kent State scored their first win, a 77\u201373  upset over the fourth-seeded Indiana Hoosiers, before falling to the Cincinnati Bearcats in the second round in San Diego.  At the end of the 2000\u201301 season, Waters accepted the head coaching job at Rutgers.  While at KSU, Waters overall record was 92\u201360.  He was succeeded at Kent State by Stan Heath.\n\n2001\u201302 season\nKent State enjoyed its best season in 2001\u201302, led by seniors Trevor Huffman, Andrew Mitchell, Demetric Shaw, and Eric Thomas and junior transfer Antonio Gates.  The season saw MAC records set in overall wins (30), conference wins (17), and longest winning streak (21).  After beginning the season 4\u20134, Kent State won 20 of their next 21 games.  Following their only MAC loss of the season (a 66\u201365 loss at Buffalo), they proceeded to win 15 straight games to close the regular season at 24\u20135 with a 17\u20131 record in the MAC and winning their first-ever MAC regular season title.  After winning the 2002 MAC men's basketball tournament, the Flashes qualified for the 2002 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and were seeded tenth in the South regional bracket.  After scoring a mild upset of the seventh-seeded Oklahoma State Cowboys, the Flashes gained national attention by defeating second-seeded SEC champion Alabama 71\u201358 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen.  The Flashes followed that win with a 78\u201373 overtime win over third-seeded Pitt to become the first MAC team to advance to the Elite Eight since Ohio in 1964, when the tournament contained only 22 teams. The Flashes' 21-game winning streak and season came to an end in the Elite Eight with an 81\u201369 loss to Indiana. The Flashes finished the season at 30\u20136 and were ranked 12th in the final ESPN/USA Today Coaches poll released after the tournament.  Following the season, Stan Heath accepted the head coaching job at the University of Arkansas, leaving after just one season and a record of 30\u20136.  Assistant coach Jim Christian was hired later that year as the next head coach.\n\nJim Christian\nThe Flashes continued their success under Jim Christian, winning over 20 games every season he was coach along with MAC East titles in 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2008; MAC overall titles in 2006 and 2008; and winning the MAC tournament again in 2006 and 2008.  In both 2003 and 2004, Kent State lost in the MAC tournament championship game and received bids to the NIT.  Following their 2006 MAC tournament title, they advanced to the 2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a 12th seed where they lost in the opening round.  In 2004, Kent State broke the MAC record for consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins by posting their sixth consecutive season.  The streak is currently at ten as the 2007\u20132008 team won their 20th game on February 12, 2008 at Central Michigan University.  In addition, Kent State broke the record for consecutive seasons with ten or more conference wins in a season by posting their ninth consecutive season of ten or more conference wins in 2006\u20132007, breaking the previous record of eight.  The 2007\u20132008 season has seen several firsts and milestones for the program.  On February 19, 2008, the Flashes recorded their 1,000th win in program history, a 76\u201366 win over the Buffalo Bulls at Buffalo's Alumni Arena.  On February 24, the Flashes scored their first-ever win against a ranked team in the regular season, defeating the Saint Mary's Gaels 65\u201357 in Moraga, California.  This was followed by Kent State's first-ever regular season ranking, rising to 23rd in the Associated Press poll and 24th in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.  With their 61\u201358 win at Akron on March 9 to close out the regular season, Kent State set a program record for wins in the regular season with 25, breaking the previous record of 24 set in the 2001\u20132002 season. Following their fifth conference tournament title, Kent State earned the highest seed in school history, a ninth seed in the Midwestern region of the 2008 NCAA tournament, where they fell to the UNLV Runnin' Rebels in the opening round.  On March 29 Jim Christian resigned to take the head coaching job at Texas Christian University.  He finished with a career record of 138\u201358 at Kent State.  Christian was replaced by his top assistant coach Geno Ford, who officially took over the program on April 2.\n\nGeno Ford\nGeno Ford took over the program in 2008 and led the team to three winning seasons, including two regular season MAC Championships in the 2009\u201310 and 2010\u201311 seasons. It was the first time a team had won successive MAC regular season championships since Miami in 1991 and 1992 and the first time a team had won two consecutive outright titles since Ball State in 1989 and 1990. In 2011, KSU appeared in their 11th MAC tournament championship game, but fell in overtime. Although the team failed to advance to the NCAA tournament during Ford's tenure, they did have three consecutive post-season appearances including the 2009 CollegeInsider.com Tournament and the 2010 and 2011 NITs. Kent State advanced to the second round of the 2010 NIT, winning their first post-season game since the 2002 Elite Eight run, and advanced to the quarterfinals of the 2011 NIT with two road wins. Ford left the team to take the head coaching job at Bradley University on March 27, 2011.  Ford finished with a 68\u201337 record at Kent State.\n\nRob Senderoff\nRob Senderoff, succeeded Ford as head coach on April 7, 2011 after briefly serving as interim head coach after Ford's departure. Senderoff had worked as an assistant at Kent State with Ford under Jim Christian from 2002\u201306 before joining the staff of Kelvin Sampson at Indiana as an assistant. Following the Kelvin Sampson recruiting controversy, Senderoff was issued a three-year show-cause penalty by the NCAA and forced to resign at Indiana. He was rehired at Kent State in 2008 as associate head coach. In his first two seasons as head coach, the Flashes continued some of their recent success, winning 20 games in each season and advancing to the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament in 2012. The 2012\u201313 season was Kent State's first season not winning at least 10 MAC games since the 1997\u201398 season, though the team did advance to the 2013 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament where they finished 1\u20131. The 2013\u201314 team struggled to a 16\u201316 record and 7\u201311 record in MAC play, the team's worst season since a 13\u201317 overall record in 1997\u201398 and worst MAC record since a 7\u201311 mark in 1996\u201397.\nJimmy Hall played for the team in 2014-17, and his career 8.69 rebounds per game were 7th-highest in the MAC. Hall was the only Kent player to ever finish his career with 1,600 points and 800 rebounds, and his 1,683 career points are third-most in Kent history. His 672 field goals are the most in school history, and his 867 rebounds are second in school history.\nDuring Senderoff's tenure, the Flashes became the first Division I program in any team sport to sign a recruit diagnosed with autism to a National Letter of Intent. Kalin Bennett, a center from Little Rock, Arkansas, was signed in November 2018 and arrived on campus in August 2019, making his debut in the last minutes of the Flashes' 2019\u201320 season opener.\n\nMAC season results\nOverall conference titles shaded in \u2588\u2588 gold.

From 2000\u201320, it included all conference members.\n\nMAC tournament\nKent State has appeared in all but three Mid-American Conference tournaments since the tournament began in 1980 and through 2025 has an overall record of 49\u201335 in tournament play. Through 2024, the Flashes have appeared in 15 MAC title games, winning seven. The seven tournament championships are tied for most in conference history with Ohio and Ball State. The 15 title game appearances are the most in conference history.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament\nThe Golden Flashes have appeared in seven NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 4\u20137.\n\nNIT\nKent State has appeared in 10 National Invitation Tournaments.  Their combined record is 7\u201310.\n\nCollegeInsider.com Tournament and The Basketball Classic\nKent State appeared in the CollegeInsider.com Tournament five times with a record of 3\u20135. They have made one appearance in The Basketball Classic, the successor to the CollegeInsider.com Tournament, and have a record of 0\u20131.\n\nAwards\nAll-Americans\nRetired numbers\nRivalries\nThe principal rivalry for the Golden Flashes is with the Akron Zips from the University of Akron, located in Akron, Ohio, approximately 10 miles (16 km) southwest of Kent. The series dates back to February 19, 1916, when the two teams played in Kent in the basement of the old heating plant, won by Akron 37\u201316. Kent State recorded their first win in the series, a 23\u201321 win at Wills Gymnasium, in 1927. Through the 2022\u201323 season, the Flashes lead the series 83\u201381. Akron's longest winning streak in the series is a nine-game streak from 1942 to 1949, while Kent State's longest winning streak is five games, which has occurred three times. Kent State had a 19-game home winning streak against the Zips, which spanned from 1964 to 1998. Despite the length of the rivalry and close proximity of the campuses, the series has only been a conference meeting since 1992 when Akron joined the Mid-American Conference. Prior to 1992, the rivalry was played in the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) for two periods, the first from 1932, when Kent State joined the conference, until 1936, when Akron left the OAC. The second period of conference play began in 1944 after Akron returned to the OAC, and ended when Kent State left the conference in 1951 to join the MAC. When the MAC created East and West divisions in 1998, both teams were placed in the East division. Since 2011, the games count as part of the larger Wagon Wheel Challenge between the two schools.\nSince the start of MAC divisional play late 1990s, the two programs have met regularly with MAC East and overall championships on the line. Through the 2024\u201325 season, the Flashes and Zips have combined for 16 MAC East titles, 11 MAC regular-season championships, and 13 MAC tournament championships. The teams have often had their second meeting of the season as the regular season's final game, with several of those games featured in national broadcasts. Akron won the East division with a 66\u201364 overtime win at the MAC Center to end the regular season and claimed the MAC regular-season title in 2012 with a 61\u201355 win in Kent. The second meeting in 2010, played at James A. Rhodes Arena and broadcast nationally on ESPN, featured both teams atop the conference standings at 12\u20133. Kent State won the game 74\u201361 to clinch the MAC regular-season title. The following season, the Flashes clinched their second-consecutive MAC title with a 79\u201368 win over the Zips at the MAC Center in a nationally televised game on the regular season's final day, repeating the feat in 2015 with a 79\u201377 win over the Zips on ESPN2 to claim the regular-season and East division co-championship.\n\nIn the MAC tournament, the Zips and Flashes have met 11 times through the 2025 tournament, including five times in the championship game. Akron holds a 7\u20134 edge in all tournament games, with Kent State picking up wins in 1998, 2008, 2017, and 2023, and Akron defeating the Flashes in 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2022, and 2024. In the MAC championship game, played in Cleveland at the venue now known as Rocket Arena, the Zips have taken three of the five meetings. Kent State defeated the Zips 74\u201355 in the 2008 MAC Championship game, the Zips claimed the 2011 MAC tournament championship over Kent State with a 66\u201365 overtime win, Kent State won the 2017 MAC tournament championship over Akron, 70\u201365, and the Zips have won the past two title matchups, winning the 2022 MAC men's basketball tournament title 75-55 and the 2024 MAC men's basketball tournament title 62\u201361 over the Flashes.\nKent State also has local rivalries with the Cleveland State Vikings from Cleveland State University and the Youngstown State Penguins from Youngstown State University, both members of the Horizon League and located in Northeast Ohio near Kent. The series with Cleveland State began in 1933 when Cleveland State was Fenn College, though was discontinued after 1945. It resumed in 1971 and has been held regularly since then. Kent State leads the Vikings 34\u201323 following an 68\u201352 win in Cleveland early in the 2024\u201325 season. The series with Youngstown State began in 1929 and lasted through 1960. It resumed in 1998 and has been held regularly since then. The Flashes lead the series 31\u201316 following a 111\u201378 Kent State win at Rhodes Arena in Akron to open the 2017\u201318 season, the Flashes' ninth straight win in the series. Kent State, Cleveland State, Youngstown State, and Akron created the Northeast Ohio Coaches vs. Cancer doubleheader, a season opening event featuring the region's Division I basketball programs that rotated to each of the four schools over a four-year period.  Kent State hosted the inaugural doubleheader in 2015, followed by Youngstown State in 2016 at the Beeghly Center, Akron in 2017 at James A. Rhodes Arena, and Cleveland State in 2018 at the Wolstein Center.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "biography": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories. For their success, Kentucky has claimed to be \"The Greatest Tradition in the History of College Basketball.\" The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.\nAdolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 61, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 133 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 134. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal.\nKentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 51.\nThroughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford.\n\nHistory\nEarly history (1903\u20131930)\nDuring Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons.\nRecords indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing. The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15\u20136 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1\u20132 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.\nThrough 1908, the team did not manage to win a season, and had an all-time record of 15\u201329. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history. That year, the team went 5\u20134, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses. The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12\u20132 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents.\n\nGeorge Buchheit and the \"Wonder Team\" (1919\u20131925)\nIn 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball, the \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.\nAlthough the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"\nIn 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9\u20135 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.\n\nC.O Applegran, Ray Eklund, and Basil Hayden (1925\u20131927)\nBuchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13\u20138 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15\u20133 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey. The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference.\nSeeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3\u201313 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.\n\nJohn Mauer and the \"Mauermen\" (1927\u20131930)\nThe Wildcats' new coach for the 1927\u201328 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"\nTeamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south \u2013 the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"\nOver his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40\u201314. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.\n\nAdolph Rupp (1930\u20131972)\nIn 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams, under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.\nRupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\n\nThe Beardless Wonders (1944)\nRupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\". Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\". Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46\u201338. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.\n\nKentucky's first championship (1948)\nOn the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36\u20133. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7\u20130 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60\u201359. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 64\u201355. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58\u201342 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2\u20131, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal. Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.\n\nBack-to-back championships (1949)\nFor the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46\u201336 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since).\n\nA new decade (1950)\nWith a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 83\u201350.\n\nThird championship and point-shaving scandal (1951)\nOver the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season.  Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68\u201358 in the NCAA finals, .\nAdolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948\u20131949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players. On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948\u201349 season.\nAt the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete. As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so. As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952\u201353 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that. Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\"\n\nUndefeated but no tournament (1954)\nThe team posted a perfect 25\u20130 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.\n\nRupp's fourth championship (1958)\nThe \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games. Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 57\u201356 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall.\n\nRupp's Runts (1966)\nRupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965\u201366 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game. Texas Western won the game 72\u201365, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second.  Kentucky was a 6.5-point favorite in the game  The game was depicted in the film Glory Road.\nThis game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.\n\nThe late Rupp years (1967\u20131972)\nThe late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.\nAfter 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13\u201313 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years.  Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26\u20131 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106\u2013100 shootout against Jacksonville. \nRupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.\n\nJoe B. Hall (1972\u20131985)\nJoe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297\u2013100, and 373\u2013156 over his career.\nCoach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.\nCoach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949\u2013 Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978\u2013 Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school. The only others to achieve this feat are:\n\nBob Knight \u2013 Player for Ohio State in 1960 and coach at Indiana in 1976, 1981, and 1987.\nDean Smith \u2013 Player for Kansas in 1952 and coach at North Carolina in 1982 and 1993.\n\nThe Super Kittens (1975)\nAfter a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later.\n\nThe Season Without Celebration and fifth championship (1978)\nIt had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94\u201388 and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years.\n\nEddie Sutton (1985\u20131989)\nEarly Sutton era (1985\u20131988)\nIn 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25\u20135 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI before losing to Villanova in the Tournament.\n\nEmery scandal (1989)\nKentucky entered the 1988\u201389 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year. Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13\u201319, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927. To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.\nThe scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father. Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed, and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach. Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned. Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989\u201390.\n\nRick Pitino (1989\u20131997)\nPost season ban and rebuilding with the Unforgettables (1989\u20131992)\nIn 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14\u201314 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a bevy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22\u20136, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament.\nBeginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103\u2013102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104\u2013103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home-grown Kentucky kids.\n\nReturn to the Final Four (1993)\nKentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was, they would fail to reach the championship game with a 81\u201378 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade.\n\nThe Mardi Gras Miracle (1994)\nKentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68\u201337 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62\u201327 over the remainder of regulation to win 99\u201395.\n\nThe Untouchables and championship number six (1996)\nStarting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by future Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years.\n\nThe Unbelievables (1997)\nThe following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time.\nPitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville.\n\nOrlando \"Tubby\" Smith (1997\u20132007)\nOrlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson. (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.\n\nNew coach and a seventh championship (1998)\nIn his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition.\nSmith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players.\n\nFinal Four drought (1999\u20132007)\nAfter leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16\u20130 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year.\nIn 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60\u201358. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6\u20134, to give the Spartans who were 8\u20133 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26\u201311 in the first half.\nAlthough Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history, although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.\n\nBilly Gillispie (2007\u20132009)\nOn April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\" Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.\n\nDecline in form (2008\u20132009)\nGillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11\u20133. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74\u201371 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71\u201369 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game. Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70\u201360. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90\u201372 win and 2\u20130 start in conference play. Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68\u201345 victory at Georgia, improving to 14\u20134 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5\u20130 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007\u201308 season. UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68\u201365 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79\u201363 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7\u20133. Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19\u201312 with an 8\u20138 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.\nOn March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".\n\nJohn Calipari (2009\u20132024)\nCalipari's first class (2010)\nOn April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes. The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe. On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90\u201369 extending their record to 11\u20130, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88\u201344 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory. By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19\u20130. Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009\u201310 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14\u20132 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance.\n\nRun to the Final Four (2011)\nIn 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12\u20132, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22\u20138 record. The hot streak would continue, and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59\u201357 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56\u201355.\n\nThe road to an eighth championship (2012)\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16\u20130 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002\u201303 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995\u201396 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30\u20131, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32\u20132 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102\u201390. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69\u201361. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67\u201359, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th).\n\nStarting anew (2013)\nThe 2012\u201313 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011\u201312 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17\u20137 including that game and went 4\u20135 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21\u201312 record.\nIn the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013\u201314 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick Flor\u00e9al, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft and decided to return for their sophomore seasons.\n\nThe Tweakables (2014)\nIn 2013\u201314, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012\u201313 team including Nerlens Noel and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin, who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State. Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein. The poor success of the 2012\u201313 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.\nThe team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls. The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14\u201320 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\". The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game.\n\nPursuit of perfection (2015)\nAfter the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft. The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season. The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams. While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game. The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72\u201340 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November. In December, the team defeated UCLA 83\u201344. Kentucky led 41\u20137 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history. The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31\u20130 record, the best start in school history. In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78\u201363 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36\u20131 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78\u201339, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history. In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68\u201366. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014\u201315 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38). After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received.\n\n2023\nThe Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal.\n\n2024\nFollowing a first round upset as a 3 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, John Calipari resigned his position of Head Coach to accept the same role at the University of Arkansas.  He was officially announced as the Razorbacks Head Coach on April 10, 2024, marking the end of his storied tenure at Kentucky.\n\nMark Pope (2024\u2013present)\nOn April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington, days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas. Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament.\nKentucky finished the 2024\u201325 season with a 24\u201312 overall record with key wins over Gonzaga, Duke in the Champions Classic, and with wins over rivals Louisville, Florida, and sweeping the regular season series against Tennessee. Major losses include Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic, Arkansas in John Calipari's return to Lexington, and Tennessee in the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16.\n\nSeason by season results\nCoaches\nThe Wildcats have had 23 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.\n\nRivalries\nThe Kentucky Wildcats have numerous rivalries with various other College Basketball programs.\n\nConference Rivalries\nArkansas\nFlorida\nTennessee\nAuburn\n\nNon-Conference Rivals\nDuke\nIndiana\nLouisville\nNorth Carolina\n\nHistoric/Defunct Rivalries\nCentre College\nTransylvania University\n\nPostseason results\nNational championships\nThe following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships:\n\nFinal Four history\nNCAA Tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nThe * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament.\n\nHonorees\nKentucky has 45 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners hung from the rafters featuring a jersey and their number. Before 1991, jersey retirements were a rare honor at Kentucky. The first to receive the honor was Layton Rouse, whose jersey was retired at the end of the 1940 season. The \"Fabulous Five\" was honored after their back-to-back championships in 1948 and 1949, with coach Adolph Rupp declaring no player would wear their numbers at Kentucky. Five years later, the entire 1953\u201354 team was honored with retired numbers after their undefeated season (they were later declared national champions by the Helms Foundation). One player from the team, Linville Puckett, was to be honored after graduation in 1956 but quit the team in 1955 and Rupp revoked the honor. Due to \"unretiring\" Puckett's number, and the point-shaving scandal that embroiled some of the Fabulous Five leading to the cancelled 1952\u201353 season, Rupp stopped honoring players with retired numbers. As a result of an NCAA rule in effect from 1957 to 2023 restricting jersey numbers to the digits 0 to 5, Kentucky began allowing players to wear the previously retired numbers.\nIn 1990, under the leadership of new athletic director C. M. Newton, Kentucky began again to honor players from the past, although the honor was a \"retired jersey\" hung from the rafters and all numbers would remain available for future players. At that time, jerseys for all the previously honored players were hung in the rafters of Rupp Arena for the first time and former coaches Adolph Rupp and Joe B. Hall were honored with banners as well. Ten days after losing in the 1992 East Regional Finals to Duke, Kentucky's four seniors, named the \"Unforgettables\", were honored with jersey retirement for their commitment to the program and helping lead it out of NCAA probation. This would be the final time players were honored with jersey retirement while still students. To be honored today, the individual must first be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame, which they are eligible for starting ten years after their final contributing year. Five years after being elected, they can be considered for jersey retirement.\nThe last player and last contributor to be honored is Mike Pratt, who was honored on February 4, 2023, with a banner denoting both his three years as a player and 20 years as a broadcaster on the UK Radio Network. The last coach to be honored is Tubby Smith, who was honored on December 31, 2021.\n\nHonored players\nHonored coaches\nHonored contributors\nAll-Time statistical leaders\nAwards\nNaismith Hall of Fame Members\nThe following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nOlympians\nThe following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games:\n\nWildcats in the NBA\nFacilities\nRupp Arena (1976\u2013present)\nThe Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+ until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545. The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976\u201377 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529\u201364 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.\n\nJoe Craft Center (2007\u2013present)\nIn 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky. The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.\nAs a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.\n\nMemorial Coliseum (1950\u201376)\nComing off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307\u201338 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum. Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teams\u2014basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball.\n\nAlumni Gymnasium (1924\u201350)\nIn 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct. Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247\u201324 (.911). After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.\n\nWoodland Park Auditorium (1914\u201316)\nWoodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15\u20137 there all-time.\n\nBuell Armory Gymnasium (1910\u201324)\nThe Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky. The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills. Kentucky was 59\u201325 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.\n\nState College Gymnasium (1902\u201314)\nThe first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there. By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17\u201314 at State College Gymnasium.\n\nCumulative all-time statistics\nAll Time Wins: 2398 (NCAA rank No. 1)\nAll Time Winning Percentage: .765 (NCAA rank No. 1)\nNCAA

    "summary": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories. For their success, Kentucky has claimed to be \"The Greatest Tradition in the History of College Basketball.\" The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.\nAdolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 61, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 133 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 134. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal.\nKentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 51.\nThroughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford.",

    "biography": "The LSU Tigers men's basketball team (aka. The Louisiana State University Tigers team) represents Louisiana State University in NCAA Division I men's college basketball. The Tigers are currently led by head coach Matt McMahon. They play their home games in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center located on the LSU campus in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The team participates in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nHistory\nEarly history (1909\u20131957)\nThe first season of LSU men's basketball was the 1908\u201309 basketball season. That same season, continuous dribbling and shots off the dribble were allowed for the first time. The first game in program history was a 35\u201320 away game victory versus Dixon Academy. The first home game in program history was an 18\u201312 victory over Mississippi A&M (now Mississippi State). The team first saw success after hiring former Mercer coach C. C. Stroud in 1914. LSU won the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) conference championship in 1917 under coach Stroud.\n\nRabenhorst era\nWake Forest alum Harry Rabenhorst coached the team from 1925 to 1957. In 1932 LSU joined the Southeastern Conference (SEC) .\nThe 1934\u20131935 Tigers \u2013 keyed by the play of first LSU All-American Sparky Wade \u2013 finished the season at 14\u20131. The Tigers defeated the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference co-champion Pittsburgh Panthers in the American Legion Bowl by a score of 41\u201337 in their final game of the season. LSU's lone defeat came to the Southwest Conference co-champion Rice Owls by a score of 56\u201347 in Houston. LSU has claimed a national championship for the 1935 season (pre-NCAA tournament), but not on the basis of any determination by an external selector.\n\nRabenhorst also led the Tigers to the 1953 Final Four with a team that finished 22\u20133 overall and 13\u20130 in conference play, and which included future NBA Hall of Famer Bob Pettit, in college notable for his hook shot. Rabenhorst's 1953\u201354 Tigers repeated as SEC champions\u2014again finishing undefeated in conference play at 14\u20130, and at 20\u20135 overall\u2014and played in the Sweet Sixteen game of the 1954 NCAA tournament, falling 78\u201370 to eventual national third-place Penn State.\n\nTough times (1957\u20131966)\nFrom 1957 to 1966, LSU was coached by Jay McCreary (1957\u20131965) and Frank Truitt (1965\u201366 season). They combined for a record of 88\u2013135. Significant players included George Nattin Jr.\n\nMaravich era (1966\u20131972)\nPress Maravich was head basketball coach from 1966 to 1972. He had an overall record of 76\u201386 at LSU. He led the team to three winning seasons, but did not win an SEC championship or make an NCAA tournament appearance. His 1969\u201370 team advanced to the NIT Final Four. This era is best known for the exploits of Press Maravich's son, \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich whom he coached from 1967 to 1970. Pete dominated at the collegiate level averaging 44.2 points per game and was named National Player of the Year in 1970.\n\nThe 1971\u20131972 season was the Tigers' first playing in the LSU Assembly Center, renamed the Pete Maravich Assembly Center after his death in 1988. Collis Temple Jr. of Kentwood also became LSU's first African-American varsity athlete during Press' final season of 1971\u20131972.\n\nDale Brown era (1972\u20131997)\nDale Brown was head LSU basketball coach for 25 years from 1972 to 1997. During his time at LSU, he led the basketball team to two Final Fours, four Elite Eights, five Sweet Sixteens, and thirteen NCAA Tournament appearances. He also led the Tigers to four regular season SEC championships and one SEC Tournament championship.\nIn 1981, small forward Rudy Macklin led LSU to the Final Four. The 1989 team featured Chris Jackson, later Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf. In 1991, Shaquille O'Neal received the Adolph Rupp Trophy.\n\nLester Earl\nIn 1996\u201397, Dale Brown signed Baton Rouge high school phenom Lester Earl, who led Glen Oaks High School to three consecutive Louisiana High School Athletic Association state championships (two in Class 4A, one in Class 5A, the highest classification), with all championship games played at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Earl played just 11 games at LSU before he was suspended and transferred to the University of Kansas soon afterward (ironically, Earl played for LSU in an 82\u201353 loss to Kansas in that season's Maui Invitational). While at Kansas, Earl said that an LSU assistant coach gave him money when he was at LSU. The NCAA quickly began an investigation. It found no evidence that Brown or his assistants paid Earl. However, it did find that a former booster paid Earl about $5,000 while he was attending LSU. The basketball team was placed on probation in 1998.\nIn September 2007, Lester Earl issued an apology to Brown, then-assistant head coach Johnny Jones, and LSU in general for his role in the NCAA investigation. Earl now has altered his original claims that the NCAA pressured him into making false claims against Dale Brown or else he would lose years of NCAA eligibility. Earl said, \"I was pressured into telling them SOMETHING. I was 19 years old at that time. The NCAA intimidated me, manipulated me into making up things, and basically encouraged me to lie, in order to be able to finish my playing career at Kansas. They told me if we don't find any dirt on Coach Brown you won't be allowed to play but one more year at Kansas. I caused great harm, heartache and difficulties for so many people. I feel sorriest for hurting Coach Brown. Coach Brown, I apologize to you for tarnishing your magnificent career at LSU.\"\nThe NCAA has declined any new comments on the situation. However, Brown says that he has forgiven Earl. \"The most interesting journey that a person can make is discovering himself. I believe Lester has done that, and I forgive him.\"\n\nJohn Brady era (1997\u20132008)\nIn 1997, John Brady replaced the legendary Dale Brown as head coach at LSU. When Brady arrived, the program was under probation and stinging from a recruiting scandal. Brady's first two years were rough.\nIn 2000, the Tigers broke through, posting a 28\u20136 record and an NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 appearance. However, due to the loss of Stromile Swift and Jabari Smith to the 2000 NBA draft, the Tigers could not carry their momentum to the next year, going 13\u201316 in 2001.\nBrady's team entered the 2005\u201306 season unranked, but were coming off a solid season in which they went 20\u201310 and made the NCAA tournament. Led by Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis and Tyrus Thomas, the Tigers won their first outright SEC regular season championship since 1985, and earned a #4 seed in the NCAA tournament. After wins over Iona and Texas A&M, LSU defeated the #1 seed Duke and #2 seed Texas to make it to their first Final Four since 1986. Set at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana, the 2006 Final Four was the first since 1980 to feature no #1 seeds (LSU, #2 UCLA, #3 Florida and #11 George Mason). Facing the #2 seed Bruins in the national semifinals, the Tigers were unable to solve UCLA's defense, losing 59\u201345, dropping LSU to 0\u20136 all-time in the men's Final Four (and 0\u201311 in all Final Four games, including an 0\u20135 mark in the women's Final Four). Despite the loss, the 2005\u201306 season will be remembered as one of the most successful in LSU men's basketball history.\nJohn Brady was fired in the middle of his 11th season as LSU's head basketball coach and just two seasons after the Tigers' latest Final Four appearance.\nOn February 8, 2008, Brady was fired from LSU. Earlier news reports stated that he would coach the Tennessee game on February 9, but LSU officials stated that his termination is immediate. Brady's assistant coach, Butch Pierre, took over as the interim head coach.\nIn ten and a half seasons at LSU, Brady compiled a 192\u2013139 record, including two SEC titles and four NCAA tournament appearances. He currently serves as the color analyst on LSU men's basketball radio broadcasts.\n\nTrent Johnson years (2009\u20132012)\nOn April 10, 2008, Trent Johnson was officially named the 20th head coach of the LSU Tigers men's basketball team. With the hiring, Johnson became the first African-American head coach of a men's sports team at LSU. In his first season at LSU, Johnson led the Tigers to 27 wins, tied for the third most wins in a season in LSU history. The Tigers won the SEC regular season championship with a record of 13\u20133. LSU returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2006. In the opening round, LSU defeated nationally ranked Butler one year prior to the Bulldogs starting their run of two straight trips to the NCAA Championship game. They advanced to the second round before falling, 84\u201370, to North Carolina. LSU had a second-half lead on the Tar Heels and the game was still in the balance entering the final eight minutes. The Tar Heels went on to capture the national championship, their second under Roy Williams and fifth overall.\nJohnson was named the 2009 consensus SEC Coach of the Year and was a finalist for four national coach of the year honors as he became the first LSU men's basketball coach to win the league title and take the team to post-season play in his first year at the school. The next two seasons were not nearly as successful, as the Tigers won a combined 5 conference games and went 11\u201320 in consecutive years.\nLSU improved to 18\u201315 in 2011\u201312 and earned a berth to the NIT, losing 96\u201376 in the first round at Oregon. Johnson resigned as LSU coach on April 8, 2012, in expectation of taking the same position at TCU.\n\nJohnny Jones era (2012\u20132017)\nOn April 13, 2012, Johnny Jones was officially named the 21st head coach of the LSU Tigers men's basketball team. He had an overall record of 90\u201372 in five seasons at LSU. In the 2014\u201315 season, Jones led LSU to its first appearance in the NCAA tournament since the 2008\u201309 season, where the Tigers fell to North Carolina State in their opening game, 66\u201365. In the 2015\u201316 season, Jones led the Tigers to a disappointing 19\u201314 overall record, including 11\u20137 in conference play. LSU was ranked 21st in the AP and 19th in the USA Today Coaches poll to start the season. Much of the hype was centered around a top 10 recruiting class which included the No. 1 overall recruit, Ben Simmons. LSU failed to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament, and declined to participate in any postseason play. Following the season, Simmons announced he would leave for the NBA draft.\nThe Tigers started the 2016\u201317 season 8\u20132, but finished the season with a 1\u201317 slide, ending 2\u201316 in SEC play and 10\u201321 overall. Jones was fired at the end of the season.\n\nWill Wade era (2017\u20132022)\nOn March 20, 2017, Will Wade was officially named the 22nd head coach of the LSU Tigers men's basketball team. During his second season, Wade coached the 2018\u201319 team to an outright Southeastern Conference regular season championship, LSU's 11th on record. However, the LSU Athletic Department suspended Wade before the conference tournament, after he refused to meet with university officials to discuss his role in conversations he is alleged to have had with a federally convicted college hoops middleman. LSU named Tony Benford interim head coach during Wade's suspension, and he coached the Tigers to the Sweet Sixteen of the 2019 NCAA basketball tournament. Wade was reinstated after the season, having met with university officials, answered their questions, and denied wrongdoing.\nDuring the 2021\u201322 season, the NCAA gave LSU a notice of allegations with regard to those recruiting violations, following a multi-year investigation. Wade is accused of five Level I and two Level II recruiting violations in the notice, and was fired for cause days later. Kevin Nickelberry was named as interim head coach, as the Tigers were eliminated in the first round of the 2022 NCAA basketball tournament.\n\nMatt McMahon era (2022\u2013present)\nMurray State head coach Matt McMahon was announced as Wade's permanent successor, signing a 7-year deal. In the first month of his tenure, all 11 scholarship players who were set to return instead chose to enter the transfer portal, a situation Jeff Borzello of ESPN described as \"fairly unprecedented.\"\nThe Tigers struggled in McMahon's inaugural season, suffering through a 15-game losing streak in January and February before ending it by defeating Vanderbilt. LSU finished 14\u201319 overall and last in the SEC at 2\u201316.\n\nChampionships\nNational championships\nLSU claims a national championship for the 1934\u201335 season. In 1935, the American Legion sponsored an intersectional \"Rose Bowl\", promoted as a basketball game \"for the national collegiate title,\" on April 13 at the Convention Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\nLSU defeated eastern champions Pittsburgh 41\u201337 and claimed the national collegiate basketball championship based on this victory.\n\nFinal Fours\nLSU has played in four Final Fours in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. The Tigers are 0-6 all-time in the Final Four, losing the third place game in 1953 and 1981. The third place game was discontinued after LSU's 78\u201374 loss to Virginia in 1981.\n\nConference championships\nLSU has won a total of 11 conference championships and one conference tournament championship since becoming a founding member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in 1933.\n\nTraditions\nBengal Brass\nA group of 72 members selected from the ranks of the band constitute the Bengal Brass Basketball Band, often simply referred to as Bengal Brass. This group of musicians (and percussionist on a drum set) is often split into two squads\u2014purple and gold\u2014and performs at LSU select home volleyball matches, many home gymnastics meets, all home men's basketball, and all home women's basketball games in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Bengal Brass also travels with the men's and women's basketball teams during postseason play. The group is led by assistant director of bands, Mr. Dowie.\n\nLSU Cheerleaders\nThe LSU cheerleaders consist of both male and female cheerleaders that perform at men's and women's basketball games. The cheerleaders lead the crowd in numerous cheers during game play and breaks. The cheerleaders are located along the baseline for home basketball games. LSU's cheerleaders also compete against other universities cheerleading squads in competitions sanctioned by the Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA). The 1989 Tiger cheerleaders won the UCA National Championship.\n\nLSU Tiger Girls\nThe LSU Tiger Girls were established as a danceline for the LSU men's and women's basketball teams. The all-female squad performs during all home games and other university and non-university sponsored functions. The Tiger Girls also compete against other universities dance teams in competitions sanctioned by the Universal Dance Association (UDA).\n\nYear-by-year results\nPostseason\nNCAA Tournament history & seeds\nThe Tigers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times. Their combined record is 27\u201327.\n\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nPrior to seeding LSU appeared in the 1953 and 1954 NCAA Tournaments.\nThe 1986 team one of the lowest-seeded teams ever to advance to the Final Four, along with George Mason in 2006, Virginia Commonwealth in 2011, Loyola\u2013Chicago in 2018, and UCLA in 2021.\n\nNIT results\nThe Tigers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) nine times.

The arena opened in 1972 and is home of the LSU Tigers basketball team. It was originally known as the LSU Assembly Center, but was renamed in honor of Pete Maravich, a Tiger basketball legend, shortly after his death in 1988. The Maravich Center is known to locals as \"The PMAC\" or \"The Palace that Pete Built\", or by its more nationally known nickname, \"The Deaf Dome\", coined by Dick Vitale.\nThe slightly oval building is located directly to the north of Tiger Stadium, and its bright-white roof can be seen in many telecasts of that stadium. The arena concourse is divided into four quadrants: Pete Maravich Pass, The Walk of Champions, Heroes Hall and Midway of Memories. The quadrants highlight former LSU Tiger athletes, individual and team awards and memorabilia pertaining to the history of LSU Tigers and LSU Lady Tigers basketball teams.\n\nJohn M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum\nThe John M. Parker Agricultural Coliseum or John M. Parker Agricultural Center opened in 1937 and was home of the LSU Tigers Basketball team from its opening until 1971. The arena sat 12,000 people for basketball. The Coliseum was host to the Pete Maravich-led teams of the late 1960s, and it was his prominence that led to the construction of the LSU Assembly Center which now bears his name.\n\nLSU Gym/Armory\nThe LSU Gym/Armory was completed in 1930 and was the home gymnasium of the LSU basketball team until 1937 when the John M Parker Agricultural Coliseum was completed, though for several years both the Gym/Armory and the coliseum were used for LSU's basketball games. The main floor was the gymnasium and the lower floor was the armory. Both floors were located on ground level. The gymnasium had a stage at one end and could be converted into an auditorium. When not set up as an auditorium, it provided an open space for basketball games and other events. The second floor provided space for locker rooms and a trophy room.\n\nState Field\nState Field was the home court for the LSU basketball team from 1908 to 1924. The court was located outside on a grass surface built on the old downtown campus of LSU. It was located south of the Pentagon Barracks and slightly southwest of the site of the current Louisiana State Capitol Building adjacent to the Hill Memorial Library and George Peabody Hall. The field was later moved to a site with bleachers that was north of the campuses experimental garden, and next to the old armory building. The field was known on the campus simply as the \"athletic field\" and was also used for LSU's baseball and football teams.\n\nPractice and Training facilities\nLSU Basketball Practice Facility\nThe LSU Basketball Practice Facility is the practice facility for the LSU Tigers basketball and LSU Lady Tigers basketball teams. The facility is connected to the Pete Maravich Assembly Center through the Northwest portal. The facility features separate, full-size duplicate gyms for the women's and men's basketball teams. They include a regulation NCAA court in length with two regulation high school courts in the opposition direction. The courts are exact replicas of the Maravich Center game court and have two portable goals and four retractable goals. The gymnasiums are equipped with a scoreboard, video filming balcony and scorer's table with video and data connection. The facility also houses team locker rooms, a team lounge, training rooms, a coach's locker room and coach's offices.\nThe building also includes a two-story lobby and staircase that ascends to the second level where a club room is used for pre-game and post-game events and is connected to the Pete Maravich Assembly Center concourse. The lobby includes team displays and graphics, trophy cases and memorabilia of LSU basketball. A 900-pound bronze statue of LSU legend Shaquille O'Neal is located in front of the facility.\n\nLSU Strength and Conditioning facility\nThe LSU Tigers basketball strength training and conditioning facility is located in the LSU Strength and Conditioning facility. Built in 1997, it is located adjacent to Tiger Stadium. Measuring 10,000-square feet with a flat surface, it has 28 multi-purpose power stations, 36 assorted selectorized machines and 10 dumbbell stations along with a plyometric specific area, medicine balls, hurdles, plyometric boxes and assorted speed and agility equipment.

The Flames have appeared six times in the NCAA tournament, most recently in 2025.\n\nHistory\nThe Liberty men's basketball program began in 1972 under head coach Dan Manley. Liberty University is the second-youngest school in NCAA Division I, founded in 1971 (Florida Gulf Coast University was founded in 1991 with instruction starting in 1997).\nThe Flames finished 13\u201314 in their inaugural season. As Liberty Baptist College, Liberty won the 1980 National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) national championship against Point Loma College (68\u201365), surviving a double-overtime thriller 64\u201362 against The King's College (NY) Purple Knights in the Eastern Regional final, in front of a standing-room-only home crowd of 7,500 in Lynchburg.\nLiberty has reached the post-season five times in its NCAA Division I history.

As a senior, his rebounding average of 14.2 led all Division II players.\nIn 1984, Kersey was selected 46th overall in the NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers. He became a starter and was part of the nucleus of a strong Portland team, along with Clyde Drexler, Terry Porter, Buck Williams, and Kevin Duckworth that made it to the NBA Finals two out of the next three years (in 1990 and 1992). Kersey also finished second to Michael Jordan in the 1987 Slam Dunk Contest. In 1999, Kersey won an NBA Championship with the San Antonio Spurs.

Ducharme averaged 19.6 points and 15.8 rebounds per game in his one year in Farmville. He led Longwood to a CVAC championship and an NCAA tournament appearance while being named the Division II National Player of the Year by multiple outlets. Ducharme remains only one of two retired numbers in Longwood history, with the other being Jerome Kersey.\n\nAntwan Carter #4\nAntwan Carter became the most efficient players in Longwood history and its best player so far in the Division I era.

This followed an investigation in which the NCAA found that the basketball program had violated rules regarding recruiting, academic eligibility, and amateurism. Among other things, the NCAA discovered that several players had received payment in exchange for playing and that an assistant coach had doctored a high school transcript in order to allow a student athlete who would have otherwise been academically ineligible to play. The NCAA's punishment is considered one of the most extreme in its history and is only one of five times that the death penalty has been applied to a member institution.\n\n2007 major violations\nIn 2007, The Ragin Cajuns were found guilty of major violations in its men's basketball program. An NCAA investigation found that now-former player Orien Greene had relied on 15 hours of correspondence courses taken through another institution in order to remain eligible for the 2004 spring semester and the entire 2004\u201305 academic year. NCAA rules do not allow student-athletes to use correspondence courses taken from another institution to remain eligible.  According to the NCAA, this was an \"obvious error\" that should have been caught right away, but the school's then-compliance coordinator, director of academic services and registrar all failed to catch it.  When school officials learned about the violations, they vacated every game in which Greene participated\u201443 games in all, including NCAA tournament appearances in 2004 and 2005\u2014and scrubbed Greene's records from the books.  The NCAA accepted Louisiana's penalties and also imposed two years' probation.\n\nAward Winners\nLou Henson Award\nJordan Brown \u2013 2023\nLefty Driesell Award\nElfrid Payton \u2013 2014\n\nPostseason\nNCAA Division I Tournament results\nThe Ragin Cajuns have unofficially appeared in 10 NCAA Division I Tournaments.

However, both of these appearances were vacated as a result of the 1973 infractions case. The Ragin Cajuns participated in the 2004 and 2005 NCAA tournaments, but both appearances were vacated due to major violations involving Orien Greene. Their official combined record is 1\u20136.

    "biography": "The Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team is the men's college basketball program representing the University of Louisville (U of L) in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) of NCAA Division I. The Cardinals have officially won two NCAA championships in 1980 and 1986 (with the 2013 title being vacated); and have officially been to eight Final Fours (with the 2012 and 2013 appearances being vacated) in 39 official NCAA tournament appearances while compiling 61 tournament wins.\n\nHistory\n\"Peck\" Hickman era (1944\u20131967)\nBernard \"Peck\" Hickman's 1944 team finished with a 16\u20133 record and started a string of 46 consecutive winning seasons, which was an NCAA record.\n\nHickman led Louisville to its first championship on a national level by winning the NAIB tournament in 1948. In 1956, led by All-American Charlie Tyra, the Cardinals won the NIT Championship. In 1956 his team was placed on two years probation, to include bans on postseason play, by the NCAA due to recruiting violations. In 1959, Louisville made its first NCAA Final Four appearance behind the play of All-American Don Goldstein.\nThe Cardinals never had a losing season in Hickman's 23 seasons as head coach.  He coached 11 20-win teams, appeared in five NCAA tournaments, coached six NIT appearances and finished with a 443\u2013183 overall record, a .708 winning percentage that ranks him in the top 45 all time.\n\nJohn Dromo era (1967\u20131971)\nJohn Dromo was Hickman's assistant for 17 years and succeeded him at head coach in 1967. In four seasons as head coach, Dromo led the Cardinals to a 68\u201323 record (.747 winning percentage) and the 1967 Missouri Valley Conference title.\nA heart attack during the 1970\u201371 season forced Dromo to retire. His assistant, Howard Stacey, was named interim head coach for the final 20 games of the season.\n\nDenny Crum era (1971\u20132001)\nDenny Crum was hired as head coach from his alma mater, UCLA, where he was the top assistant coach to John Wooden. It was under the guidance of Crum that Louisville became a college basketball power. In his first season, he guided the Cardinals to the NCAA Final Four, becoming the first coach ever to go to a Final Four in his first season as a head coach. Overall, Crum had six Final Fours with the Cardinals (1972, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1986). He is fifth all-time in Final Four appearances.\nThe Cardinals won the 1980 NCAA tournament championship by defeating UCLA 59\u201354. Six years later, Louisville would overcome Duke 72\u201369 for a second title. Crum is one of only 11 coaches to win two or more national championships. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1980, 1983 and 1986.\nHe took the Cardinals to 23 NCAA tournaments, where they had an overall record of 43\u201321. While in the Metro Conference, the Cardinals won 12 regular season titles and 11 tournament championships. In its 19 years of naming a champion, the Metro had Louisville as first or second place 17 times. In 1993, Crum became the second fastest coach to reach 500 wins.\nCrum was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame in 1994. He retired in 2001 with a career record of 675\u2013295 (.696 winning percentage) over 30 seasons. He was a member of the College Basketball Hall of Fame's inaugural class in 2006.\n\nRick Pitino era (2001\u20132017)\nRick Pitino was hired in 2001 after four years as head coach of the Boston Celtics, and previously as head coach of Louisville's in-state rival, Kentucky.\nPitino guided the Cardinals to the NCAA Tournament in 12 of 15 seasons, reaching the Elite Eight six times and the Final Four three times (2005, 2012, and 2013). His teams won six conference tournament championships and four regular season titles. The Cardinals won at least 20 games every season since Pitino's first season at Louisville. Through the 2015\u201316 season, Pitino amassed a record of 391\u2013134 (.745) during his time at Louisville.\nPitino was selected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, and was under contract through the 2025\u201326 season.\nThe University of Louisville self-imposed a postseason ban for the 2015\u201316 season amid an ongoing NCAA investigation over an escort sex scandal involving recruits between 2010 and 2014. The ban included both the ACC tournament and the NCAA tournament.\nOn June 15, 2017, the NCAA charged Rick Pitino for failure to monitor his basketball program which was involved in a sex-for-pay scandal. He was suspended for the first five games of the ACC season in 2017\u201318.\nOn September 26, 2017, federal prosecutors in New York announced that the school was under investigation for an alleged \"pay for play\" scheme involving recruits at Louisville. The allegations state that an Adidas executive conspired to pay $100,000 to the family of a top-ranked national recruit to play at Louisville and to represent Adidas when he turned pro. The criminal complaint did not name Louisville specifically but appeared to involve the recruitment of Brian Bowen, a late, surprise commit to the school. On September 27, 2017, Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich were placed on administrative leave.\nOn October 26, 2017, Rick Pitino was fired as the head coach of Louisville Men's Basketball.\nOn February 20, 2018, the NCAA ruled that Louisville must vacate its records from 2011 to 2015.  This included 123 wins, the 2013 NCAA title, and a 2012 Final Four appearance.\n\nChris Mack era (2018\u20132022)\nOn March 27, 2018, Xavier head coach Chris Mack agreed to terms on a seven-year contract worth about $4 million annually to become the next head coach at Louisville.  Louisville was the first ever school to hire away a head coach whose previous team was a 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Mack had a notable start to his Louisville tenure, recruiting a top-5 2019 class that included a 5-star player, four 4-star players, and a three-star player. Picked to finish 11th in the 2018 preseason ACC poll, Mack led the Cardinals to a 20\u201314 season peaking at #15 in the AP polls and finishing in seventh place in the ACC standings with signature wins over #9 Michigan State, #12 North Carolina, and #11 Virginia Tech and tough losses to #5 Tennessee, Marquette, #22 Florida State, and #2 Duke. Under Mack, Louisville made only one NCAA tournament appearance.\nOn January 26, 2022, Louisville and Chris Mack mutually agreed to part ways.\n\nKenny Payne era (2022\u20132024)\nOn March 18, 2022, it was announced that the University of Louisville signed Kenny Payne to a six-year contract as head coach.\nKenny Payne ended his first season with the worst record in modern times for any Louisville team, finishing the season 4\u201328. \nOn March 13, 2024, Louisville fired Payne after a two-year record of 12\u201352.\n\nPat Kelsey era (2024\u2013present)\nOn March 28, 2024, Pat Kelsey was introduced as the 23rd head coach for the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team, signing a 5-year contract. \nIn year one, Kelsey took over a program that won just 12 games in the previous two seasons and hadn't made the NCAA Tournament since 2018. Despite this, Kelsey led the \"reviville\", leading the Cards to a 27\u20138 record and an 18\u20132 record in ACC Play. The Cardinals secured the two-seed in the ACC Tournament where they defeated seventh seed Stanford and third-seed Clemson, securing the programs first trip to the ACC Championship where they lost to first seed and top ranked Duke 73\u201362. Louisville received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 8 seed, where they lost in the first round to Creighton. Due to the success and quick program turn around in year one, Pat Kelsey won ACC Coach of the Year.\n\nNotable achievements\nAs of the end of the 2015\u201316 season, Louisville had an all-time 1778\u2013892 record in 102 seasons of intercollegiate basketball ranking 10th in all-time victories and seventh in all-time winning percentage among NCAA Division I schools. From 1944 to 1990, Louisville had an NCAA-record 46 straight winning seasons, winning 20 or more games on 31 occasions during that period.\nLouisville has made 42 NCAA Tournament appearances (5th all-time) and 15 NIT appearances. The Cardinals have reached the NCAA Tournament 32 of the last 40 years (12 of the last 15, 14 of the last 18 years, 20 of last 25). Since the NCAA began keeping Sweet Sixteen appearance records in 1975, Louisville's 21 Sweet Sixteens are 5th all-time behind North Carolina (26), Kentucky (25), Duke (24), and Kansas (22). The Cardinals have reached the Elite Eight on 14 occasions, including five of the past nine seasons. Louisville is sixth in tournament victories (75) with a 75\u201341 overall NCAA Tournament record, reaching the Final Four 10 times.\nLouisville is the only school in the nation to have claimed the championship of three major national post-season tournaments including the 1948 NAIA championship, the 1956 NIT title and the 1980 1986 and 2013 NCAA championships. Simultaneously, Louisville is the only school in NCAA history to have a Men's Basketball National Championship vacated, along with 2 Final Four appearances.\n\nBy the numbers\n* NCAA vacated all wins from 2011 to 2015\n\nPost-season results\nNational championships\n1948 NAIA Tournament Championship\n1956 NIT Championship\n1980 NCAA Tournament Championship\n1986 NCAA Tournament Championship\n2013 NCAA Tournament Championship (Vacated)\nNCAA Tournament Final Four history\n1959\u2013 Fourth place\n1972\u2013 Fourth place\n1975\u2013 Third place\n1980\u2013 Champion\n1982\u2013 Semifinalist\n1983\u2013 Semifinalist\n1986\u2013 Champion\n2005\u2013Semifinalist\n2012\u2013 Semifinalist \u2013 Vacated\n2013\u2013 Champion \u2013 Vacated\n\nNCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player\n1980 \u2013 Darrell Griffith\n1986 \u2013 Pervis Ellison\n2013 \u2013 Luke Hancock\n\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\n* \u2013 Overall number one seed.

Before that, they belonged to the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from the 1925\u201326 to 1947\u201348 seasons, the Ohio Valley Conference for the 1948\u201349 season, the Missouri Valley Conference from 1964\u201365 to 1974\u201375, the Metro Conference from 1975\u201376 to 1994\u201395, Conference USA from 1995\u201396 to 2004\u201305, the Big East Conference from 2005\u201306 to 2012\u201313, and the American Athletic Conference in 2013\u201314.\nThey played as an independent school from 1911\u201312 to 1924\u201325 and from 1949\u201350 to 1963\u201364 (29 total seasons).\n\nMissouri Valley Conference (7)\n1967, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975\nMetro Conference (12)\n1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1993, 1994\nConference USA (1)\n2005\nBig East Conference (2)\n2009, 2013 (Vacated)\nAmerican Athletic Conference (1)\n2014\n\nConference tournament championships\nThe Cardinal have won 19 conference tournament championships.\n\nKentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference tournament (2)\n1928, 1929\nMetro Conference tournament (11)\n1978, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994, 1995\nConference USA tournament (2)\n2003, 2005.\nBig East Conference tournament (3)\n2009, 2012 (Vacated), 2013 (Vacated)\nAmerican Athletic tournament (1)\n2014 (Vacated)\n\nRivalries\nKentucky Wildcats\nThe Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry has been ranked the 2nd best rivalry in college basketball by Bleacher Report and 3rd best rivalry in all of college sports by Basketball Hall of Fame contributor Dick Vitale. Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983.   The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the 1983 NCAA tournament.  Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\nMuch like the Iron Bowl, the Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years.  Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in NCAA men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time winningest programs in Division I Men's Basketball and Louisville #26 (#10 including vacated victories).  Kentucky has eight national championships while Louisville has two (officially; three including the vacated 2013 title) national championships.\n\nCincinnati Bearcats\nWhile predominantly a football rivalry, the proximity and long-standing conference affiliation of Cincinnati and Louisville made this into a key rivalry, particularly in the days of the Metro and Big East conferences.  This rivalry went on hiatus in 2014 when Louisville left the American Athletic Conference for the ACC.\n\nNotable Cardinals\nRetired numbers\nLouisville basketball has honored five former players by retiring their numbers. Except as noted, these are the last players to wear these numbers for a Louisville men's squad:\n\nCharlie Tyra #8 \u2013 A consensus All-American during the 1956 and 1957 seasons, Charlie Tyra led the University of Louisville to its first NIT title in 1956 and was named the tournament's MVP for his performance. Tyra was named Helms Athletic Foundation All-American in his junior and senior years. One of only five Cardinals to record over 1,000 rebounds in his career, Tyra ranks as the all-time rebounder in U of L history with 1,617. During the 1955\u201356 season, Tyra pulled down 645 rebounds, a mark that has been bettered by only three other players in NCAA history. He set the Louisville record for most rebounds in a game when he pulled down 38 against Canisius during the 1955\u201356 season. In his four seasons with Louisville, he helped his teams to a combined record of 88\u201323 and three straight NIT appearances. Tyra ranks third in career free throws made (448), second in career rebounding average (17.0), fourth in career scoring average (18.2), eighth in career scorers (1,728 points) and eighth in field goals made (640). Tyra is one of only four players in UofL history to score 40 points or more in a game (achieved against Notre Dame when he hit 12 of 16 field goals and all 16 of his free throw attempts). Tyra died on December 29, 2006, at the age of 71. He was drafted #2 by in the Detroit Pistons in the 1957 NBA draft.\nWes Unseld #31 \u2013 When Wes Unseld ended his career with the University of Louisville following the 1967\u201368 season, he left as the Cardinals' all-time leading scorer for a three-year player. Today, Unseld ranks 10th on the all-time scoring list, but his career point total of 1,686 is still tops for a three-year player. A consensus All-American during his junior and senior years, Unseld is one of only five other Cardinal players to pull down over 1,000 rebounds in his career. His 1,551 career rebounds ranks second behind Tyra's 1,617. Unseld began his senior season with a 45-point effort against Georgetown College, a UofL record that still stands today. Unseld, chosen as second player overall in the NBA draft by Baltimore, was honored on the All-Missouri Valley Conference team all three years at UofL and the Cardinals were 60\u201322 during his three seasons. During his junior year, Unseld led the Cardinals to a final No. 2 ranking in both wire service polls. Unseld's 20.6 scoring average still ranks as the top scoring average in Louisville history. His 18.9 rebounding average also ranks as the top average for a Cardinal. While playing on the Cardinals' freshmen team, Unseld averaged 35.8 points and 23.6 rebounds, and hit 68.6 percent from the field.\nDarrell Griffith #35 \u2013 The 1980 Player of the Year and consensus first team All-American led Louisville to four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances, winning the 1980 Championship as he had promised when he committed to his hometown Cardinals. Griffith's career 2333 points and single-season 825 points rank first in Louisville history. He scored in double figures in 41 straight games and 111 of his 126 games with the Cardinals. His play earned him the nickname \"Dr. Dunkenstein\".  He was drafted #2 by the Utah Jazz in the 1980 NBA draft.\nPervis Ellison #42 \u2013 Ellison won the 1986 NCAA Tournament MOP award after leading the Cardinals to their second NCAA Tournament Championship. A consensus first team All-American in 1989, he is the only Louisville player to score 2000 points and grab 1000 rebounds in a career. His 374 career rejections rank first at Louisville and ranked Ellison third all time in the NCAA when he left in 1989. He was drafted #1 by the Sacramento Kings in the 1989 NBA draft.\nRuss Smith #2 \u2013 Smith, the Cardinals' all-time steals leader with 275 and also fifth in career scoring with 1,908 points, was a consensus first-team All-American in 2013\u201314 after receiving third-team All-American honors from the National Association of Basketball Coaches and Sporting News in 2012\u201313, when the Cardinals won their since-vacated third national title. His number retirement ceremony was held at Louisville's January 22, 2022, home game against Notre Dame. The number is being worn by Sam Bearden in the 2021\u201322 season, but will not be issued in future seasons.\n\nCardinals in the Hall of Fame\nLouisville has three representatives in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Cardinal All-American and former Washington Bullets All-Star Wes Unseld, who was inducted in 1988, former coach Denny Crum, who was inducted in 1994, and coach Rick Pitino, who was inducted in 2013. Darrell Griffith, a national player of the year and consensus All-American at the University of Louisville, is part of the 2014 induction class for the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nNational Player of the Year awards\n1980 \u2013 Darrell Griffith (John R.

Their numbers remain active.\n\nConference Player of the Year\nKey\nConference Tournament Most Outstanding Player\n1000-point scorers\nAs of 2015, Louisville has 67 1000-point career scorers, second only to North Carolina for most all time.\n\nCardinals in the pros\nThe Cardinals have had 75 players taken in the NBA draft, the most recent being Ray Spalding, who was chosen in the 2018 NBA draft, and Donovan Mitchell, who was chosen in the 2017 NBA draft. 30 former Cardinal players are playing professional basketball, with six of those currently playing in the NBA.\n\nSeveral other former players have played in the NBA, including:\n\nFacilities\nHome courts\nKFC Yum! Center (2010\u2013present)\nSince the 2010\u201311 season the Cardinals have played their home games at the KFC Yum! Center located along the banks of the Ohio River in downtown Louisville. As of February 7, 2017, Louisville has a 114\u201314 record (.891) in 6 seasons in the KFC Yum! Center.\nThe facility has a seating capacity of 22,090 with 71 suites and 62 loge boxes.  It is the third-largest in the nation (behind only Syracuse's Carrier Dome, Tennessee's Thompson-Boling Arena, and Kentucky's Rupp Arena). Louisville ranked among the top 3 in attendance in the first three seasons at the KFC Yum! Center. The attendance record of 22,815 was set on March 9, 2013, against #24 Notre Dame.\nThe playing surface at the KFC Yum! Center is named Denny Crum Court in honor of Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum. The University of Louisville first renamed its home court after Crum in January 2007.\nSince the opening of the KFC Yum Center, the University of Louisville has become the most valuable college basketball team in the nation.  In 2012 the Cardinals were worth $36.1 million, up nearly 40% from two years earlier, before the Yum Center opened.\n\nFreedom Hall (1956\u20132010)\nFrom 1956 to the completion of the KFC Yum! Center in 2010, the Cardinals played their home games at Freedom Hall. Louisville had a 664\u2013136 record in 54 seasons in Freedom Hall (.83 winning percentage). Freedom Hall has been the site of six NCAA Final Fours, four additional NCAA events and 10 conference tournaments. ESPN College Basketball magazine once named Freedom Hall as the nation's \"Best Playing Floor.\"\nLouisville ranked among the top 10 nationally in average home attendance at Freedom Hall for 31 years, including the last 28 in the nation's top five (19,397 in 2009\u201310, third in the nation). In 2010, a new Freedom Hall attendance record was set when 20,135 fans witnessed the Cardinals defeat the #1 ranked Syracuse Orange in the final University of Louisville game in the arena.\n\nJefferson County Armory (1945\u20131972)\nJefferson County Armory was the primary home of Louisville Cardinals basketball starting in 1945 when Bernard \"Peck\" Hickman was head coach until the 1957\u201358 season, when Freedom Hall became their primary home game site. The Cardinals played 10 of their home games in the Jefferson County Armory in 1956\u201357 and three games in Freedom Hall. Louisville played one game at the armory in 1958\u201359.In the 1960s the armory was renamed the Louisville Convention Center. The Cardinals played two games at the Convention Center in 1963\u201364 and three games in the Convention Center in 1964\u201365. The last game the Cardinals played there was November 30, 1972. Louisville was 153\u201323 all time at the Jefferson County Armory which is now named the Louisville Gardens.\n\nBelknap Gymnasium (1931\u20131944)\nAfter playing home games at numerous venues in its early years, the Cardinals moved to the newly constructed Belknap Gymnasium in 1931. The gym housed 600 bleacher seats and the baskets were mounted directly to the wall. Louisville compiled a 56\u201335 (.615 winning percentage) before moving to the Jefferson County Armory. The gym was razed in 1993 to make way for Lutz Hall.\n\nPractice facilities\nPlanet Fitness-Kueber Center (2007\u2013present)\nSince 2007 the Cardinals have practiced at the $15.2 million, 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) Planet Fitness-Kueber Center on campus. The Planet Fitness-Kueber Center houses the teams basketball offices, practice facilities, film room and training areas.\nThe facility was named the Yum! Center, until December 2018 when local businessmen Rick and David Kueber donated $3 million to rename the facility.\n\nControversies and scandals\n1956 recruiting violations\nIn 1956 the team was placed on probation for two years by the NCAA, including bans on postseason play, due to recruiting violations.\n\n2015 sex scandal\nA former Louisville player, and then Director of Basketball Operations, Andre McGee, arranged and paid for strippers and prostitutes to perform striptease dances and sexual acts for 17 prospective and former basketball players from 2010 to 2014. On October 3, 2015, the book publisher IBJ Custom Publishing released a book entitled \"Breaking Cardinal Rules.\"  Based on revelations provided by the local self-described escort, Katina Powell, the book detailed striptease dances and acts of prostitution that Powell and McGee arranged and organized in Minardi Hall over approximately a four-year period.\nDuring the investigation of the allegations, the university self-imposed a ban on the 2016 NCAA tournament. In June 2016, the NCAA announced that the university would lose four basketball scholarships over the course of four seasons, but there would be no further postseason ban. The NCAA suspended head coach Rick Pitino for five ACC games during the 2017\u201318 season.  The NCAA also ordered the university to vacate all wins from 2011 to 2014 that include ineligible players. The vacated wins include a Final Four appearance in 2012 and an NCAA Tournament Championship in 2013. Luke Hancock's 2013 Final Four Most Valuable Player Award was reinstated by the NCAA because he was found to be innocent of any NCAA rule violations.\n\n2017\u201318 NCAA corruption scandal\nAs a result of a corruption scandal implicating various schools including Louisville, on September 27, 2017, Louisville placed head coach Rick Pitino on unpaid administrative leave and athletic director Tom Jurich on paid administrative leave. Rick Pitino and Tom Jurich would then be fired with cause by the university. Two days later, assistant David Padgett, a former star player under Pitino at Louisville, was named as acting head coach.\n\nSee also\nCincinnati\u2013Louisville rivalry\nKentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry\nLouisville\u2013Memphis rivalry\nList of college men's basketball coaches with 600 wins\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

  "Loyola Chicago Ramblers": {
    "biography": "The Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team represents Loyola University Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. The Ramblers participate as members of the Atlantic 10 Conference. The Ramblers joined the Missouri Valley Conference in 2013, and stayed until 2022. Prior to 2013, the team had spent 34 seasons as a charter member of the Horizon League.\nIn 1963, Loyola won the 1963 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament (then the \"NCAA University Division\") men's basketball national championship under the leadership of All-American Jerry Harkness, defeating two-time defending champion Cincinnati 60\u201358 in overtime in the title game. All five starters for the Ramblers played the entire championship game without substitution.\nSurviving team members were honored on July 11, 2013, at the White House to commemorate the 50th anniversary of their victory. The entire team was inducted in November of that year in the College Basketball Hall of Fame. As of 2025, Loyola remains the only school from the state of Illinois to win a men's Division I basketball NCAA tournament. Loyola's first-round regional victory over Tennessee Tech on March 11, 1963, remains a record for margin of victory (69 points) for any NCAA men's basketball tournament game.\nThe team gained national publicity again in 2018, as a result of both their Cinderella Story-esque performance in the tournament, in which they upset numerous teams to reach the Final Four as an 11-seed, tying for the lowest seed ever to do so, and the cultural popularity of their team chaplain, the then-98-year-old nun Sister Jean.\nAs of February 17, 2021, the team had achieved its highest Kenpom ranking ever, at number nine in the country, with the number one ranked defense.\n\nHistory\nRacial integration\nThe Loyola University Chicago teams of the early 1960s, coached by George Ireland, are thought to be responsible for ushering in a new era of racial equality in the sport by shattering all remaining color barriers in NCAA men's basketball. Beginning in 1961, Loyola broke the longstanding gentlemen's agreement (not to play more than three black players at any given time), putting as many as four black players on the court at every game. For the 1962\u201363 season, Ireland played four black Loyola starters in every game. That season, Loyola also became the first team in NCAA Division I history to play an all-black lineup, doing so in a game against Wyoming on December 29, 1962. In that season's NCAA tournament, Loyola defeated the all-white team of then-segregated Mississippi State by a score of 61\u201351, a game especially notable because the Bulldogs defied a state court order prohibiting them from playing against a school with black players. The game has since been dubbed the \"Game of Change\" in popular culture.\nIn 1963, Loyola shocked the nation and changed college basketball forever by starting four black players in the NCAA championship game. Loyola's stunning upset of two-time defending NCAA champion Cincinnati, in overtime by a score of 60\u201358, was the crowning achievement in the school's nearly decade long struggle with racial inequality in men's college basketball, highlighted by the tumultuous events of that year's NCAA Tournament. Loyola's 1963 NCAA title was historic not only for the racial makeup of Loyola's team, but also due to the fact that Cincinnati had started three black players, making seven of the 10 starters in the 1963 NCAA Championship game black.\n\nHome venues\nThe team's original home venue was the on-campus Alumni Gym. However, Loyola later moved to play their games at DePaul University's Alumni Hall, and subsequently moved around, with stints at Northwestern University's McGaw Memorial Hall (today known as Welsh Ryan Arena), the University of Illinois at Chicago's Illinois-Chicago Pavilion, and the Chicago Stadium.  From 1987 until 1989, Loyola played at the International Amphitheatre, but suffered poor attendance at that venue. From 1989 until 1994, the team played at the Rosemont Horizon (today known as the \"Allstate Arena\"), but suffered low attendance at the venue and moved back to the on-campus Alumni Gym in 1994. In 1996, the team moved into their current on-campus home, the Joseph J. Gentile Arena, which replaced Alumni Hall.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Ramblers have appeared in eight NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 15\u20137. They were National Champions in 1963. On March 24, 2018, the Ramblers defeated Kansas State 78\u201362 to advance to play in their second Final Four in school history.\n\nNIT results\nThe Ramblers have appeared in seven National Invitation Tournaments. They reached the championship game twice, and won the third place consolation game once. Their combined record is 9\u20136.\n\nCBI results\nThe Ramblers have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) once, winning it in 2015. Their record is 5\u20130.\n\nRetired numbers\nAs of 2022, eight players have had their jerseys retired by the school.\n\nAwards\nAll-Americans\n\n1929, 1930 \u2013 Charlie \"Feed\" Murphy\n1937 \u2013 Marv Colen\n1938, 1939 \u2013 Mike Novak\n1938, 1939 \u2013 Wibs Kautz\n1948 \u2013 Jack Kerris\n1952 \u2013 Nick Kladis\n1962, 1963 \u2013 Jerry Harkness\n1967 \u2013 Jim Tillman\n1970, 1972 \u2013 LaRue Martin\n1982 \u2013 Wayne Sappleton\n1985 \u2013 Alfredrick Hughes\n2006 \u2013 Blake Schilb (Honorable Mention)\n2018 \u2013 Clayton Custer (Honorable Mention)\n2021 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig (Third Team)\nAcademic All-Americans\n\n2013 \u2013 Ben Averkamp (Second Team)\n2019 \u2013 Clayton Custer (Third Team)\n2021 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig (Second Team)\nMCC/Missouri Valley Coach of the Year\n\n1985 \u2013 Gene Sullivan\n2018 \u2013 Porter Moser\nMCC/Horizon League/Missouri Valley Player of the Year\n\n1981 \u2013 Darius Clemons\n1982 \u2013 Wayne Sappleton\n1983, 1984, 1985 \u2013 Alfredrick Hughes\n1987 \u2013 Andre Moore\n2018 \u2013 Clayton Custer\n2019 \u2013 Marques Townes\n2021 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig\nMCC/Horizon League/Missouri Valley First Team\n\n1981 \u2013 Darius Clemons\n1981, 1982 \u2013 Wayne Sappleton\n1983, 1984, 1985 \u2013 Alfredrick Hughes\n1984, 1986 \u2013 Carl Golston\n1985 \u2013 Andre Battle\n1986, 1987 \u2013 Andre Moore\n1987 \u2013 Bernard Jackson\n1988 \u2013 Gerald Hayward\n1990, 1991 \u2013 Keith Gailes\n1992 \u2013 Keir Rogers\n1998, 1999 \u2013 Javan Goodman\n2001, 2002 \u2013\n2004 \u2013 Paul McMillan\n2005, 2006, 2007 \u2013 Blake Schilb\n2017 \u2013 Milton Doyle\n2018 \u2013 Clayton Custer\n2019 \u2013 Marques Townes\n2019, 2020, 2021 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig\n\nMCC/Horizon League/Missouri Valley Second Team\n\n1980, 1982 \u2013 Darius Clemons\n1983 \u2013 Andre Battle\n1985 \u2013 Carl Golston\n1985 \u2013 Andre Moore\n1988 \u2013 Kenny Miller\n1989 \u2013 Keith Gailes\n1994 \u2013 Vernell Brent\n1996, 1997 \u2013 Derek Molis\n2000 \u2013 Earl Brown\n2003 \u2013 David Bailey\n2012, 2013 \u2013 Ben Averkamp\n2018 \u2013 Donte Ingram\n2021 \u2013 Lucas Williamson\nMissouri Valley Conference Third Team\n\n2017 \u2013 Donte Ingram\n2018 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig\n2019 \u2013 Clayton Custer\n2020  \u2013 Tate Hall\n2021 \u2013 Aher Uguak\nMCC/Horizon League/Missouri Valley All-Defensive Team\n\n1998, 2000 \u2013 Earl Brown\n2004 \u2013 Demetrius Williams\n2006, 2007 \u2013 Majak Kou\n2018 \u2013 Ben Richardson\n2020  \u2013 Lucas Williamson\n2021 \u2013 Aher Uguak\n2021 \u2013 Lucas Williamson\nMCC/Horizon League/Missouri Valley Newcomer of the Year\n\n1984 \u2013 Carl Golston\n1986 \u2013 Bernard Jackson\n1988 \u2013 Kenny Miller\n1989 \u2013 Keith Gailes\n2003 \u2013 Paul McMillan\n2014 \u2013 Milton Doyle\nMCC/Horizon League/Missouri Valley All-Newcomer Team\n\n1988 \u2013 Kenny Miller\n1993 \u2013 Vernell Brent\n1996 \u2013 Derek Molis\n1999 \u2013 Chris Williams\n2003 \u2013 Paul McMillan\n2003 \u2013 Demetrius Williams\n2006 \u2013 Leon Young\n2014 \u2013 Milton Doyle\n2017 \u2013 Aundre Jackson\n2018 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig\n2020 \u2013 Tate Hall\n2021 \u2013 Braden Norris\nMissouri Valley Freshman of the Year\n\n2014 \u2013 Milton Doyle\n2018 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig\nMissouri Valley All-Freshman Team\n\n2014 \u2013 Milton Doyle\n2018 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig\n2018 \u2013 Lucas Williamson\n2019 \u2013 Cooper Kaifes\n2020 \u2013 Marquise Kennedy\nMissouri Valley Sixth Man of the Year\n\n2017 \u2013 Aundre Jackson\nMissouri Valley Defensive MVP\n\n2018 \u2013 Ben Richardson\n2021 \u2013 Lucas Williamson\nMCC/Horizon League/Missouri Valley Tournament MVP\n\n1983, 1985 \u2013 Alfredrick Hughes\n2018 \u2013 Donte Ingram\n2021 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig\nMCC/Horizon League/Missouri Valley All-Tournament Team\n\n1980, 1982 \u2013 Darius Clemons\n1982 \u2013 Wayne Sappleton\n1983, 1985 \u2013 Alfredrick Hughes\n1984, 1985 \u2013 Carl Golston\n1985 \u2013 Andre Battle\n1986 \u2013 Carl Golston\n1987 \u2013 Bernard Jackson\n1987 \u2013 Andre Moore\n1989, 1990, 1991 \u2013 Keith Gailes\n1992 \u2013 Keir Rogers\n2002 \u2013 David Bailey\n2002 \u2013 Ryan Blankson\n2005, 2007 \u2013 Blake Schilb\n2018 \u2013 Donte Ingram, Ben Richardson, Marques Townes\n2021 \u2013 Cameron Krutwig, Braden Norris\n\nRamblers in the NBA draft\nRamblers players in the NBA/ABA\nWilbert Kautz (1947)\nMickey Rottner (1947\u20131948)\nJack Dwan (1949)\nMike Novak (1949\u20131950)\nJerry Nagel (1950)\nJack Kerris (1950\u20131953)\nDon Hanrahan (1953)\nEd Earle (1954)\nJerry Harkness (1964\u20131969)\nLes Hunter (1965\u20131973)\nLaRue Martin (1973\u20131976)\nAndre Wakefield (1979\u20131980)\nWayne Sappleton (1985)\nAlfredrick Hughes (1986)\nAndre Moore (1988)\nMilton Doyle (2017\u20132018)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

  "Marquette Golden Eagles": {
    "biography": "The Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team (formerly the Marquette Hilltoppers and Marquette Warriors) represents Marquette University in NCAA Division I college basketball and competes in the Big East Conference. The team plays its home games at Fiserv Forum in downtown Milwaukee (also the home of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks).\nMarquette has made 37 NCAA tournament appearances, most recently in 2025. The Golden Eagles appeared in the Final Four in 1974, 1977, and 2003, were the national runner-up in 1974 and have won 1 national championship in 1977. Marquette initially joined a conference in 1989, winning 5 conference regular season championships and 2 conference tournament championships. \nThe Golden Eagles have had 3 national coaches of the year, 4 conference coaches of the year, 1 national player of the year, 10 consensus all-americans, 4 conference players of the year, and 16 all-conference first team selections. Marquette has also had 3 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and 4 National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame inductees. Additionally, 39 Marquette players have gone on to play in the NBA combining for 7 NBA championships, 25 NBA all-star selections, and 11 all-NBA selections.\n\nHistory\nMcGuire era\nAl McGuire became the head coach in 1964 and brought the program to national prominence, earning an NIT Championship in 1970 and a Final Four appearance in 1974 against the North Carolina State Wolfpack, where McGuire became the first coach ejected from a championship game.\n McGuire coached with assistants Hank Raymonds and Rick Majerus, who each had their own stints as head of the program following his departure. In his final season as a collegiate head coach, McGuire led Marquette to its only NCAA basketball championship in 1977. Led by Alfred \"Butch\" Lee, Maurice \"Bo\" Ellis and Jerome Whitehead, the team beat UNC Charlotte in the national semifinals after Whitehead received a full-court pass and subsequently made a last-second shot. Two days later, Marquette defeated Dean Smith's North Carolina Tar Heels for the title. The team set a record with seven losses going into the NCAA tournament, the most losses up to that time for a team that would win the NCAA Championship.\n\nCrean era\nTom Crean took over the program on March 30, 1999. According to Crean, \"Once Marquette became available, that's where my sights were. I had unbelievable respect for the tradition and the name. When I thought of Marquette, I thought of a true basketball school and to me that had a lot to do with it.\" Crean immediately made a number of changes at Marquette, creating a new team image by increasing the significance of the team's media day and instituting a \"Midnight Madness\" event commonly held by schools on the night teams are allowed to begin practice. Crean's first recruiting class was considered by experts to be among the top twenty in the country, Marquette's first in a long time.\nIn his nine years with Marquette, Crean's teams earned five NCAA tournament bids, one more than the previous four Marquette coaches had in the 16 years prior to his arrival. During his tenure there Crean recruited, developed and coached a number of skilled players that made significant contributions in both the NCAA and NBA, including Dwyane Wade, Dominic James, Steve Novak, Wesley Matthews, and Travis Diener.\nOver his final seven seasons at Marquette, Crean compiled an aggregate record of 160\u201368 (.702). The 2002\u201303 season was one of the best in Marquette history. The team made a Final Four appearance for the first time since winning the NCAA Championship in 1977. Crean has referred to the team's run as \"one of the greatest four or five days of my life.\"\nLater that year, Marquette accepted an offer to leave Conference USA for the Big East Conference after the 2004\u20132005 season. Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese cited his friendship with Crean as contributing to the invitation, saying, \"That, to me, was one of the great appeals, to get Tommy as well as Marquette into the league.\"\nWhen Crean was asked why he left Marquette, Crean replied, \"It's Indiana. It's Indiana, and that is the bottom line.\"\n\nWilliams era\nAfter Crean departed for the head job at Indiana, Buzz Williams was hired as the new head coach for the 2008\u201309 season, leading Marquette to a 25\u201310 record in and a second round loss to the Missouri Tigers in the 2009 NCAA tournament. He coached Marquette to a 22\u201312 record in the 2009\u201310 season, which ended with a close loss to the 11th-seeded Washington Huskies in the First Round of the 2010 NCAA tournament.\nDuring the 2010\u201311 campaign, Williams led the Golden Eagles back to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2003. His team went 22\u201315 including a 9\u20139 Big East Conference record. They lost in the quarterfinals of the 2011 Big East men's basketball tournament to Louisville. Marquette received an at-large bid in the 2011 NCAA tournament. There they defeated Xavier in the second round (formerly the First Round) and Syracuse in the Third Round to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. In the Sweet Sixteen, they were defeated by No. 7-ranked and No. 2-seeded North Carolina.\nWiliams' 2012 team returned to the NCAA tournament after finishing second in the Big East regular season, finishing 14\u20134 in conference play. As a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament, they defeated BYU and Murray State to advance to their second straight Sweet Sixteen. There, they lost to No. 7-seeded Florida.\nAfter winning a share of the Big East Men's regular season championship, Marquette received an at-large bid in the 2013 NCAA tournament as a No. 3 seed. There, they earned come-from-behind victories over Davidson in the Second Round and Butler in the Third Round. In the Sweet Sixteen, the school's third straight under Williams, they defeated ACC regular season and conference champion Miami to earn a trip to Williams's first Elite Eight, where they lost to Syracuse. \nThe 2013\u201314 season was Williams' worst at Marquette, finishing 17\u201315 with a loss to Xavier in the Big East tournament.\n\nWojciechowski era\nOn April 1, 2014, Steve Wojciechowski was hired as the new Marquette head basketball coach, replacing Buzz Williams, who left for Virginia Tech. \nBefore the 2014-15 season, Marquette lost several players, including Jamil Wilson and Davante Gardner. The team struggled mightily, finishing 13-19 overall and 4-14 in conference play, tying for last in the conference standings. After beating Seton Hall in the first round of the Big East Tournament, Marquette lost to Villanova in the quarterfinals. Marquette failed to qualify for any postseason tournament.\nThe 2015-16 campaign was highlighted by Henry Ellenson, a five-star recruit from Rice Lake, Wisconsin. Ellenson won the 2016 Big East Rookie of the Year award, and was named first-team All-Big East in his lone season in the NCAA. Besides Ellenson, Luke Fischer and Haanif Cheatham also played significant roles. The Golden Eagles finished the year 20-13, with an 8-10 record in the Big East, placing 7th in the conference. Marquette's season would come to an end after losing to Xavier in the quarterfinals of the 2016 Big East Tournament.\nAfter losing Ellenson to the NBA, Marquette reloaded with 3 four-star recruits joining the 2016-17 team, Markus Howard, Sam Hauser, and Brendan Bailey. Despite being picked to finish seventh in the Big East, Marquette finished the season tied for 3rd in the Big East, going 19\u201313 with a 10\u20138 record in the Big East. After losing to Seton Hall in the quarterfinals of the 2017 Big East Tournament, Marquette earned a 10 seed in the 2017 NCAA Tournament, their first appearance since 2013, but lost to eventual final four participants South Carolina.\nAfter losing Luke Fischer, JaJuan Johnson, and Haanif Cheatham, Marquette added four-star recruits Jamal Cain and Ike Eke, and three-star recruits Theo John and Greg Elliott for the 2017-18 season. The team failed to match the success of the previous season, finishing 21-14 with a 9\u20139 record in the Big East, tying for 6th in the conference. The team was headlined by Markus Howard, Sam Hauser, and Andrew Rowsey, with the three combining for 55 PPG during the season. After beating DePaul in the first round of the 2018 Big East Tournament, Marquette lost to eventual NCAA champion Villanova in the quarterfinals. Marquette qualified as a 2 seed for the 2018 NIT, beating Harvard and Oregon before losing to 4 seed Penn State in the quarterfinals.\nThe 2018-19 campaign saw the team's first season in the Fiserv Forum, leaving the Bradley Center, their home since 1988. The season would end up being the best season of Wojciechowski's tenure at Marquette. Although the team lost Andrew Rowsey, Marquette signed Joey Hauser, the younger brother of Sam. The team finished 24-10 with a 12\u20136 record in the Big East, placing 2nd in the conference. The team saw a remarkable season for Markus Howard, who averaged 25 PPG. Sam and Joey Hauser played supporting roles, along with Theo John and Sacar Anim. In February, Marquette ranked as high as 10 in the AP poll but lost 5 of their last 9 games of the regular season, including losing dropping 4 straight to close out the regular season. Marquette beat St. John's in the quarterfinals of the 2019 Big East Tournament, but lost to Seton Hall in the semifinals, by a score of 79-81. Marquette was picked as a 5 seed in the 2019 NCAA Tournament, where they matched up against Murray State, led by eventual second overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, Ja Morant. Murray State dominated the entire game, upsetting Marquette 83-64.\nDespite high expectations for the 2019-20 season, the Hauser brothers would transfer out of the program in the offseason, hurting Marquette's chances to make it back to the NCAA tournament. Wojciechowski was able to successfully recruit Symir Torrence and Dexter Akanno, but the hole left by the Hausers was too great. While Markus Howard averaged 27.8 PPG for the season, becoming Marquette's all-time leading scorer in the process, the team finished with an 18-12 overall record, and an 8-10 record in the Big East, their worst Big East record since 2016. The team was slated to play Seton Hall in the 2020 Big East Tournament, but the tournament - and the entire season - was halted due to the outbreak of COVID-19.\nThe 2020-21 season was another disappointment for Marquette. With the departure of Markus Howard, the team struggled, going 13-14 overall, and 8-11 in the Big East. finishing 9th in the Big East. The incoming recruiting class looked promising however, with Dawson Garcia and Justin Lewis making an impact. Garcia stated all 27 games and averaged 13 points and 6.6 rebounds for the season, and Lewis averaging 7.8 points and 5.4 rebounds per game off the bench.\nOn March 19, 2021, it was announced that Marquette had fired Wojciechowski after seven seasons.\n\nSmart era\nOn March 26, 2021, Marquette University hired Shaka Smart to replace Wojciechowski as the Golden Eagles head coach.\nAs Smart assumed control of the program, many players transferred out, including the promising Dawson Garcia, Theo John, Symir Torrence, Jamal Cain, and Koby McEwen. Additionally, D. J. Carton declared for the draft. Smart was able to land four key transfers to aid the team for the 2021-22 season: sophomores Olivier-Maxence Prosper from Clemson and Tyler Kolek from George Mason, along with graduate transfers Darryl Morsell from Maryland and Kur Kuath from Oklahoma. Smart was also able to obtain two four-star recruits from the class of 2021: Emarion Ellis and David Joplin, and three-star Keeyan Itejere, adding to the four-star and three-star that Wojciechowski recruited: Stevie Mitchell and Kam Jones.\nMarquette finished the season with a surprising 19-13 record, including an 11-8 record in the Big East, tying for 5th in the conference. The team was ranked as high as 18 before a late-season skid saw the team lose 5 of their last 9 regular season games. They faced Creighton in the 2022 Big East Tournament, but lost 74-63. The team was selected as a 9 seed in the 2022 NCAA Tournament, but lost to 8 seed North Carolina in the round of 64, 95-63.\nMarquette was projected to finish 9th in the Big East for the 2022-23 season, but surprised many with their best season in a decade. The team finished with a 29-7 record and won the Big East Regular Season and Tournament Titles, their first Big East Tournament win in program history. Marquette was selected as a 2 seed in the 2023 NCAA Tournament, beating 15 seed Vermont before losing to 7 seed Michigan State.\nMarquette came into the 2023-24 season with lofty expectations, despite losing Olivier-Maxence Prosper to the NBA. The team never fell below 17th in the AP Poll and finished 3rd in the Big East, with a 27-9 record. In the 2024 Big East Tournament, Marquette beat Villanova in the quarterfinal and Providence in the semifinal before losing to UConn in the final. They were again selected as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, defeating 15 seed Western Kentucky and 10 seed Colorado en route to their first Sweet Sixteen berth since 2013 before losing to 11 seed NC State, 67-58.\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament\nMarquette has appeared in the NCAA tournament 37 times. Their combined record is 44\u201338. They were National Champions in 1977.\n\nNIT\nMarquette has appeared in the National Invitation Tournament 16 times. Their combined record is 23\u201315. In 1970, Marquette was ranked 8th and received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. The NCAA slotted Marquette into the Midwest regional rather than the closer Mideast regional. Al McGuire was so displeased about this that Marquette actually turned down the NCAA bid and chose to instead play in the NIT, which they won. Marquette is the only university to spurn an NCAA tournament invite. The NCAA later instituted a rule which forbade an NCAA Division I men's basketball team from spurning an NCAA bid for an NIT bid. An antitrust case by the NIT ensued over this issue, and the NCAA settled out of court.\n\nNCIT\nMarquette appeared in the last National Catholic Invitational Tournament in 1952 and won the NCIT championship.\n\nCoaches\nAwards and honors\nIndividual Coaching honors\nIndividual Player honors\nConsensus All-America First Team\n\nDean Meminger (1971)\nJim Chones (1972)\nButch Lee (1978)\nDwyane Wade (2003)\nMarkus Howard (2020)\nConsensus All-America Second Team\n\nEarl Tatum (1976)\nButch Lee (1977)\nSam Worthen (1980)\nMarkus Howard (2019)\nTyler Kolek (2024)\nKam Jones (2025)\nBig East Conference Men's Basketball Sixth Man of the Year Award\n\nDavante Gardner (2013, 2014)\nAndrew Rowsey (2017)\nDavid Joplin (2023)\nAll-Midwestern Collegiate Conference First Team\n\nTony Smith (1990)\nAll-Great Midwest Conference First Team\n\nRon Curry (1993)\nJim McIlvaine (1994)\nAll-Conference USA First Team\n\nBrian Wardle (2001)\nDwyane Wade (2002, 2003)\nTravis Diener (2004, 2005)\nAll-Big East Conference First Team\n\nSteve Novak (2006)\nDominic James (2007)\nJerel McNeal (2009)\nJae Crowder (2012)\nDarius Johnson-Odom (2012)\nHenry Ellenson (2016)\nMarkus Howard (2019, 2020)\nJustin Lewis (2022)\nTyler Kolek (2023, 2024)\nKam Jones (2025)\n\nRetired numbers\nNotes\n\nHall of Fame inductees\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n\nTex Winter (Contributor)\nEddie Hickey (Coach)\nAl McGuire (Coach)\nDwyane Wade (Player)\nNational Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame\n\nTex Winter (Coach)\nEddie Hickey (Coach)\nAl McGuire (Coach)\nRick Majerus (Coach)\n\nAll-time career leaders\nLists are accurate through the 2019\u201320 season.\n\nPlayers in the NBA\nCurrent\nAll-time\nPlayers in international leagues\nSacar Anim (born 1997), basketball player in the Israeli Basketball Premier League\nNiv Berkowitz (born 1986), Israeli basketball player in the Israeli Basketball Premier League\nJoseph Chartouny, Lebanese Basketball League\nSandy Cohen (born 1995), American-Israeli basketball player in the Israeli Basketball Premier League\nHenry Ellenson, Liga ACB\nJayce Johnson (born 1997), basketball player in the Liga Na\u021bional\u0103\nMarkus Howard, Saski Baskonia\nJamil Wilson (born 1990), basketball player for Hapoel Jerusalem in the Israeli Basketball Premier League\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "biography": "The Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team represents the University of Maryland in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I competition. Maryland, a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), left the ACC in 2014 to join the Big Ten Conference. Gary Williams, who coached the Terrapins from 1989 to 2011, led the program to its greatest success, including two consecutive Final Fours in 2001 and 2002, which culminated in the 2002 NCAA National Championship. Maryland has appeared in 31 NCAA tournaments and won their conference tournament 4 times. The Terrapins have competed in 102 seasons, accumulating an overall record of 1,678\u20131,109 as of the 2024\u201325 season. \nThe Terrapins played in what many consider to be the greatest Atlantic Coast Conference game in history \u2014 and one of the greatest college basketball games ever  \u2014 the championship of the 1974 ACC men's basketball tournament, in which they lost 103\u2013100 in overtime to eventual national champion North Carolina State. The game was instrumental in forcing the expansion of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, thus allowing for at-large bids and the inclusion of more than one team per conference. That Maryland team, with six future NBA draft picks, is considered by many to be the greatest team not to have participated in the NCAA tournament.\n\nHistory\nEarly years \u2013 the H. Burton Shipley era\nBefore basketball became a permanent fixture in College Park, the school\u2014then known as Maryland Agricultural College\u2014met with little success in its intermittent attempts to establish a basketball team. A team first appeared in 1904\u201305, playing only two games in an intramural/club setting.  Their first game was recorded as a loss to a \"Washington YMCA,\" but the final score is unknown.  Games were played sporadically during the 1910\u20131911, 1912\u201313, 1913\u20131914, and the 1918\u20131919 seasons, going a combined 7\u201336.  Basketball returned to stay for the 1923\u201324 season, when the school convinced former star quarterback H. Burton Shipley, who had been coaching at the University of Delaware, to come back to his alma mater.  The Old Liners, as they were then known, joined the Southern Conference in their inaugural season.  The team met with moderate success that year at 5\u20137 and also played its first games against future ACC rivals North Carolina and Virginia.  The Old Liners had their first sustained success over the next four seasons, finishing at or above .500 in each of them and putting together an outstanding 24\u20139 record against Southern Conference foes.  The Aggies also played their first games against what would become their two other biggest rivals in the future during that time, North Carolina State and Duke.\nThe school's biggest success during its formative years took place in the early 1930s, around the time it adopted its current nickname, Terrapins.  After finishing second in the conference in 1930\u201331, Maryland won the Southern Conference tournaments, beating Louisiana State, North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky over five days, a feat they followed by winning the conference regular season crown the next year. The team also had its first individual star in Louis \"Bosey\" Berger who was named to All-America teams both seasons.  It was during this stretch that the school erected a new home for its basketball teams, Ritchie Coliseum, which housed the team until Cole Field House replaced it a quarter of a century later.\nAlthough the team would remain competitive throughout the rest of the decade, finishing as high as second in the conference regular season, it never again matched its achievements of the early part of the decade, and as the 1940s began, the school's basketball team fell on exceedingly hard times.  Shipley tallied just one winning season in his last seven years before stepping down to focus on coaching the baseball team, a post he'd held for his entire tenure since returning to College Park.  He was succeeded by Flucie Stewart.  In what would become a long-running pattern at Maryland when a long-tenured head coach stepped down, Stewart would not last very long, putting together three losing seasons in three tries during his brief time at Maryland.\n\nThe Bud Millikan era and the ACC\nThe 1950s began with a new head coach leading the way, Bud Millikan.  A disciple of legendary coach Henry Iba, Millikan's emphasis on defense and fundamentals would become hallmarks of the program over the next two decades.  Maryland quickly reeled off seven straight winning seasons under Millikan. For the 1953\u201354 season, the team joined North Carolina, North Carolina State, Duke, Wake Forest, Virginia, Clemson, and South Carolina in leaving the SoCon for the newly formed Atlantic Coast Conference.  That season was perhaps the finest the Terrapins had experienced to date, finishing with a 23\u20137 record and a conference mark good enough for second in the league.  Maryland experienced its first games as a ranked team, spending the final nine weeks of the season ranked in the AP Top 20, peaking at No. 11 before settling for a final ranking of #20.  It also featured the school's first win over a ranked team when it beat local rival George Washington, then-number 7 in the country.  The team was led by its second All-American, Gene Shue, who was honored in both that season and the prior year.\nAfter that season, the team remained the only school outside of the North Carolina \"Big Four\" \u2013 Duke, UNC, North Carolina State, and Wake Forest \u2013 to consistently field competitive teams.  In the ACC's second year, the Terps cracked the top ten for the first time, peaking at No. 6 in January before eventually finishing the season with a disappointing one-point loss to Virginia in the ACC tournament quarterfinal round.\nThe Terps had another breakout season during the 1957\u201358 season. After a good regular season (17\u20136, 4th in the ACC), Maryland stunned the league by winning the ACC tournament, including wins over #6 Duke and #13 North Carolina on back to back days to capture the title as well as the league's berth in the NCAA tournament.  The team routed Boston College 86\u201363 at Madison Square Garden with just two days of rest after the ACC tournament, advancing to the East Regionals in Charlotte.  The Terps lost a tight game to Temple in the round of 16 before beating Manhattan in the consolation game to secure third place in the East.\nThat would be the high-water mark for the Terps under Millikan.  They experienced their first losing season under the coach the next season, although they did manage to finish third in the ACC, including its first ever win over a #1 ranked team when it beat North Carolina 69\u201351 in Cole Field House on February 21.  By 1962\u201363, the bottom had dropped out and the Terps finished just 3\u201311 in the ACC, next to last in the standings.  While Millikan managed to turn the program around in the mid-1960s, finishing in a second place tie in 1964\u201365 and above .500 overall again the next season, the feeling in College Park was that the game had passed the coach by, and he was replaced after the following season by assistant Frank Fellows.  Fellows' tenure lasted just two seasons, both of which featured only eight wins.\n\nThe Lefty Driesell era\nIn 1969, Charles \"Lefty\" Driesell was hired by the University of Maryland. During his introductory press conference, he made the bold statement that he wanted to make Maryland the \"UCLA of the East\". At that time, UCLA was the nation's dominant college basketball program. While Driesell did not elevate Maryland to UCLA's heights, he did lead the Terrapins to eight NCAA tournament appearances, a National Invitation Tournament championship, two Atlantic Coast Conference regular season championships, and one Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship. Maryland also attained a No. 2 Associated Press ranking during four consecutive seasons from 1972 to 1976.\nDriesell coached the Maryland Terrapins from 1969 to 1986. During his tenure, he successfully recruited numerous exceptional players, including Tom McMillen, Len Elmore, John Lucas, Albert King, Buck Williams, and Len Bias. In 1974, he signed perhaps the best college prospect of his career, future basketball Hall of Famer Moses Malone, but Malone chose instead to go to a professional basketball franchise, the Utah Stars. Malone was the first player in the modern era to proceed directly from high school into professional basketball, deciding on the day classes were scheduled to begin.\nAt Maryland, Driesell began the now nationwide tradition of Midnight Madness. According to longstanding NCAA rules, college basketball teams were not permitted to begin practices until October 15. Driesell traditionally began the first practice with a requirement that his players run one mile in six minutes, but found that the players were too fatigued to practice effectively immediately afterwards. At 12:03 a.m. on October 15, 1971, Driesell held a one-mile run at the track around Byrd Stadium, where a crowd of 1,000 fans had gathered after learning of the unorthodox practice session. The event soon became a tradition to build excitement for the basketball team's upcoming season.\nIn 1972, Maryland defeated Niagara, 100\u201369 to secure the National Invitation Tournament championship. Driesell said that the season attained the three goals he had set for the program at the time of his hiring: \"national prominence\", \"national ranking\", and \"a national championship\".\nOn July 12, 1973, Driesell saved the lives of at least ten children from several burning buildings. He and two other men were surf fishing around midnight in Bethany Beach, Delaware when he saw flames coming from a seashore resort. Driesell broke down a door and rescued several children from the fire that eventually destroyed four townhouses. An eyewitness, Prince George's County circuit court Judge Samuel Meloy, said, \"Let's face it, Driesell was a hero. There were no injuries and it was a miracle because firemen didn't come for at least 30 minutes.\" Driesell said, \"Don't build me up as any kind of hero. All we did was try to get the kids out. It was just lucky that we were fishing right in front of the houses.\" For these actions, Driesell was awarded the NCAA Award of Valor.\nIn 1974, the No. 4 Terrapins played in what many consider one of the greatest college basketball games of all time, losing the ACC men's basketball tournament 103\u2013100 in overtime to eventual national champion and No. 1 North Carolina State. Each team only played seven players each, and eight of those 14 went on to be NBA Draft picks, including six from Maryland. The game included 91 field goals made on 157 attempts between the teams, in spite of top-level defense being played. \"We didn't score 100 points or they didn't because we were sorry defensive teams. (N.C. State) had a 7-foot-4 center\" in Tommy Burleson, said Lefty Driesell. \"We had (Len) Elmore, who was one of the best shot-blockers ever to play in the league.\" After the game, the Greensboro, N.C. crowd, traditionally unfriendly to non-North Carolina ACC teams, gave both teams a standing ovation. After the loss, Maryland declined an invitation to the NIT. Maryland's team was considered by many to be the greatest team not to have participated in the NCAA tournament because, at the time, only the winner of a conference tournament would earn a bid. It was Maryland's exclusion that finally forced an expansion to allow at-large bids and more than one team per conference.\nDriesell's legacy will forever be tied to one of Maryland's greatest players and one of the best college basketball players of all time, Len Bias, who played under Driesell from 1982 to 1986. As a freshman, Bias was viewed as \"raw and undisciplined\", but ultimately developed into an All-American player who impressed basketball fans with his amazing leaping ability, his physical stature and his ability to create plays, and was considered one of the most dynamic players in the nation. In 1984, Driesell and Bias led the team to the school's second ACC tournament Championship. In Bias's junior year, he led the ACC in scoring, was named the ACC Player of the Year, and was a consensus second-team All-American while averaging 18.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. His senior season was highlighted by his performance in an overtime victory against top-ranked North Carolina in which he scored 35 points, including 7 in the last 3 minutes of regulation and 4 in overtime. At the end of the year, Bias collected his second ACC Player of the Year award and was a consensus first-team All American while averaging 23.2 points and 7 rebounds per game. Scouts from various NBA teams viewed Bias as the most complete forward in the class of 1986 and was widely considered to be of equal talent to Michael Jordan, who played at North Carolina from 1981 to 1984. \"Over the years, you've heard a lot of people say it was that jumper that separated him from Michael Jordan \u2014 and could have potentially made him a better player than Jordan in the pros,\" said Keith Gatlin, who was the starting point guard on the school's 1985-1986 team and lived with Bias. Together, Bias and Driesell made four straight NCAA tournaments, making the Sweet 16 in 1984 and 1985.\nOn June 19, 1986, Bias tragically died of a cocaine-induced heart attack shortly after being drafted by the Boston Celtics as the No. 2 overall selection. An investigation revealed that Bias was 21 credits short of the graduation requirement despite having used all his athletic eligibility. In October, a university panel found that the basketball staff had stressed athletics over academics. On October 29, Driesell resigned as head coach and took a position as an assistant athletic director. He also worked as a television analyst during college basketball games. Some members of the media widely described Driesell as a scapegoat of chancellor John B. Slaughter and the university administration.\nIn 2018, Coach Driesell was finally inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nTop of the mountain: the Gary Williams era\nThe Maryland Terrapins announced Maryland alumnus Gary Williams as its next head coach on June 13, 1989. The basketball program and the Maryland athletic program as a whole were still reeling from the aftershock of the 1986 death of Maryland basketball star Len Bias and struggles under coach Bob Wade, a former high school coach from Baltimore. Williams was coming off a successful stint at Ohio State featuring one NCAA tournament appearance and two NIT appearances in three seasons. Williams played for Maryland as the starting point guard under coach Bud Millikan. He was a member of the 1966 Charlotte Invitational Tournament championship team and the 1965 Sugar Bowl Tournament championship team. He set a Maryland record for field goal percentage, going 8-for-8 from the field in an ACC game against South Carolina in 1966. (35 years later a Williams pupil, Lonny Baxter, would break that record, hitting all ten of his field goal attempts.) Williams was the Maryland team captain in 1967. He graduated in 1968 with a B.S. in marketing.\nWilliams coached the 1989\u201390 squad to a respectable 18\u201313 record and an NIT berth. However, in March 1990, the NCAA imposed harsh sanctions on the school for several violations, mostly dating to the Wade era. Maryland was banned from postseason play in 1991 and 1992, and was kicked off live television for 1990\u201391. Additionally, Maryland docked itself several scholarships over two years. With his recruiting efforts severely hamstrung, Williams found it very difficult to rebuild the program. However, with the help of Walt Williams, Maryland stayed competitive through a low point of the program's history.\nAfter a surprise appearance in the 1994 Sweet 16, the Terrapins were a fixture in the national rankings until 2005. Maryland's teams during this era featured future NBA players such as Joe Smith, Steve Francis, \u0160ar\u016bnas Jasikevi\u010dius, Juan Dixon, Steve Blake, Lonny Baxter, Terence Morris, and Chris Wilcox, and a cast of supportive role players, exemplified by Byron Mouton.\nIn 2001, Williams led Maryland to the first Final Four in school history, losing to Duke in the semifinals despite leading by as much as 22 points in the first half and being up by 11 at half. Maryland fans largely attribute the loss to several controversial fouls that limited the Terps' defense, including a phantom fifth foul on Lonnie Baxter with 2:48 remaining. The Final Four loss to Duke was the fourth meeting between the two schools during the season, which included each team winning on the other's home court. Duke's win at Cole Field House is known as the \"Gone in 54 Seconds\" game, after Duke came back to win despite being down 10 points with under a minute left. The Terps got their revenge by winning on Shane Battier's senior night at Cameron Indoor Stadium before losing to Duke by two points in the ACC tournament semifinals on a tip-in shot with 1.3 seconds remaining.\nOn April 1, 2002, Williams led the Terrapins to their first NCAA National Championship, defeating Indiana 64\u201352. Maryland's historic run included wins against four straight former champions, including Kentucky in the Sweet 16, UConn in the Elite Eight, and Kansas in the Final Four. Williams was the first coach to win a national championship without a single McDonald's All American on the roster since its inception. He became the first coach to direct his alma mater to a national title since Norm Sloan accomplished the feat with North Carolina State in 1974. The 2002 team also won a school-record 32 games, as well as the school's first outright ACC title in 22 years\u2014only the third time since 1981 that a team from North Carolina hadn't won at least a share of the title. Senior Juan Dixon was named the 2002 NCAA Final Four MVP, ACC Player of  the Year, and finished his career as the school's all-time scoring leader. Steve Blake also produced what Maryland fans remember as the \"Oh He Steal\" game, when Blake memorably stole the ball from Duke's Jay Williams and scored just before halftime in front of a raucous home crowd. 2001-2002 was also the Terps' final season in historic Cole Field House, with Maryland going undefeated at their long-time home.\nIn 2004, having slipped to 7\u20139 in the ACC (the team's first sub-.500 conference record in more than a decade), the Terps upset the tournament's top three seeds to win its first ACC tournament title since 1984. In knocking off No. 15 Wake Forest (3 seed), No. 17 NC State (2), and No. 5 Duke (1), tournament MVP John Gilchrist dazzled. Gilchrist scored 16 points against a Chris Paul-led Wake Forest team, led a 21-point comeback against NC State by scoring 23 of his 30 points after halftime, and poured in another 26 points in a memorable 95\u201387 overtime victory over Duke in the final. Maryland's championship ended Duke's streak of five straight ACC championships.\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, Maryland failed to make the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 1993\u20131994 season, which was then the longest streak in the ACC. This began a relatively mediocre stretch for Maryland, where they failed to make the tournament three out of the next five years. Maryland's best team in these years was 2006\u201307, when the team finished 25\u20139 (10\u20137 ACC) and ranked No. 18 in the final AP poll. Led by the once highly touted senior class of D. J. Strawberry, Mike Jones, Ekene Ibekwe, and Will Bowers, along with precocious freshman Greivis Vasquez, the Terps beat a Stephen Curry-led Davidson squad in the first round of the NCAA tournament before narrowly missing the Sweet 16 when they fell to Butler 59\u201362, which shot 12-26 (46%) from 3. The 06-07 squad memorably beat Duke twice and won what many fans consider one of the loudest games at the then-named Comcast Center when they beat No. 5 North Carolina.\nThe 2009\u201310 Terrapins brought the swagger (and the shimmy) back to College Park when they won a share of the regular-season conference title with Duke. Senior Greivis Vasquez won ACC Player of the Year and consensus second team All American honors as he climbed to No. 2 all time in points and assists at Maryland, while Williams earned his second ACC Coach of the Year award. The season's highlights included Cliff Tucker's buzzer beating three pointer to defeat Georgia Tech at home (after Coach Williams called a timeout that unintentionally nullified what would have been a game-winning three by Vasquez) and a win over eventual national champion Duke on Vasquez's senior night. The Terrapins earned a 4 seed in the Midwest Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they handily beat Houston 89\u201377 in the first round. In the second round Maryland faced a tough 5th seeded Michigan State, coached by Tom Izzo and led on the court by Kalin Lucas and future NBA star Draymond Green. Behind Vasquez's 26 points, Maryland stormed back from 17 points down in the second half to take the lead in the final seconds before MSU's Korie Lucious hit a heartbreaking buzzer beater to sink the Terrapins 85\u201383. The loss especially hurt after the top seed in the region, Kansas, lost to 9 seed Northern Iowa, which opened a clear path to the Final Four. The 2009\u20132010 team was to be the last great Gary Williams team. The following season a group of promising freshmen and veteran holdovers from the 2009\u20132010 team failed to replicate the success of the prior season and the Terrapins struggled to a 19\u201314 mark, failing to make the post-season altogether for the first time since 1993.\nOn May 5, 2011, Gary Williams announced his decision to retire from coaching basketball. He remains involved with the Maryland athletic department as Assistant Athletic Director and Special Assistant to the athletic director. Gary Williams will always be treasured and remembered for saving his alma mater from the doldrums of the post-Bias era years and eventually building Maryland into a national champion. In honor of his legendary career, Maryland named its hardwood at the Xfinity Center \"Gary Williams Court\". In 2014, Coach Williams was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nB1G new world \u2013 the Mark Turgeon era\nMark Turgeon had built a very respectable mid major program at Wichita State but ended with a disappointing year before beginning a successful spell in College Station with the Aggies in 2007.\nPrior to his last year at Texas A&M, Turgeon had negotiated a contract extension and salary increase. On May 9, 2011, at 8pm, Turgeon met with his coaching staff and players to inform them that half an hour earlier he accepted the head coach position at the University of Maryland. He had visited the campus earlier that day and left with an offer. When asked about his decision at an Aggie Athletics press conference, he said \"Maryland's got a great basketball tradition. [Texas A&M and Maryland are] real similar. It's a gut feeling.\" In their meeting earlier that night he told the Aggie players \"it was the hardest decision [he] ever had to make... because of [them].\" Turgeon said that fan attendance at A&M did not factor into his decision.\n\nThe last ACC years: 2011\u20132014\nTurgeon inherited an average roster featuring hardworking forward James Padgett, the well rounded Sean Mosley, sophomore point guard Pe'Shon Howard, and volume scorer Terrell Stoglin. Turgeon and his staff secured 4 star Baltimore freshman Nick Faust and the Ukrainian big man Alex Len. Turgeon captured his first win as the University of Maryland Head Coach on November 13, 2011, by defeating UNC Wilmington at the Comcast Center 71\u201362. Maryland struggled throughout the season and finished with a 17\u201315 overall record and a 6\u201310 mark in the ACC.\nThe 2012\u201313 team was a young team. Veteran Sean Mosley graduated and leading scorer Terrell Stoglin left the program. In the first example of what would become a Mark Turgeon staple, he cobbled together a roster with transfers and freshman and led the Terrapins to 25 wins and the NIT Semifinals. Alex Len  became a breakout star averaging 11.9 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game, eventually being drafted 5th overall by the Phoenix Suns following the season. Xavier transfer Dez Wells would become a star in his three years in College Park. He led the team in scoring with 13.1 a game.\nFollowing Alex Len's decision to leave for the NBA, the Terps struggled through what would be their final ACC season falling back to a 17\u201315 record. In their final ACC regular season game, the Terrapins defeated the 5th ranked Virginia Cavaliers 75\u201369 in OT at the Comcast Center.\n\nRecent success 2014\u2013present\nIn November 2012 ESPN reported that the University of Maryland, a charter member of the ACC, was in \"serious negotiations\" to join the Big Ten. Yahoo! Sports confirmed the news, and added that Big East Conference member Rutgers University was also in advanced talks to join the Big Ten.\nThese reports noted that the Big Ten's then-current first-tier media rights deal was set to expire in 2017, and the conference was preparing for negotiations on a new deal. Both potential new members offered access to large new media markets for the conference. The ESPN report stated that Maryland was somewhat torn over the possible move from the ACC to the Big Ten. Two key players for Maryland in the negotiations, president Wallace Loh and athletic director Kevin Anderson, did not have ACC ties, and Loh was a former provost of Big Ten member Iowa. However, the chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) that ultimately oversees the school, Brit Kirwan, had been on the College Park campus for 30 years and, according to ESPN, had a strong affinity for the ACC. In addition, one of the Maryland regents told ESPN that Under Armour founder and major Maryland athletic booster Kevin Plank was \"100 percent\" behind a Big Ten move, and was heavily lobbying regents. On November 19, the Maryland regents voted to accept the Big Ten's offer, and the Big Ten presidents unanimously approved Maryland's entry later that day. The Terrapins officially joined in July 2014.\nThe athletic department was not in a strong financial position at the time. In July 2012, Maryland dropped seven varsity teams due to a deficit reported by The Washington Post as $4 million. In addition, the ACC voted earlier in 2012 to increase its exit fee to $50 million; the only two members to vote against the increase were Maryland and Florida State. Sources at Maryland believed that the school would be able to negotiate the buyout downward.\nThe 2014\u201315 Terrapins were led by senior star Dez Wells and freshman sensation Melo Trimble.  Maryland won their first Big Ten basketball game in a 68\u201366 double overtime thriller at Michigan State. Maryland finished their first Big Ten season with a 14\u20134 record, finishing second. Turgeon was named Big Ten Coach of the Year. Maryland was selected as a 4 seed in the NCAA tournament. In the First Round Maryland defeated #13 Valparaiso 65\u201362. In the second round the Terps faced fifth seeded West Virginia and lost 69\u201359 after Melo Trimble got knocked out of the game with a concussion. Trimble was named a second-team All American by The Sporting News, and both he and Wells were named first team Big Ten.\nThe 2015\u201316 Terrapins entered the season with high expectations. Blue chip recruit Diamond Stone and transfers \nRobert Carter and Rasheed Sulaimon paired up with Melo Trimble and Jake Layman to create a formidable starting 5 for the Terps. The Terrapins were 11\u20131 entering conference play, featuring wins over Georgetown and UConn and a memorable, competitive 89\u201381 loss against eventual national runner-up North Carolina at the Dean Smith Center in the ACC/B1G challenge. Maryland got out to a 10\u20132 record in the Big Ten before losing 4 of the last 6 to finish 3rd in the conference with a 12\u20136 record. The Terps handled Nebraska 97\u201386 in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals in Indianapolis. In the semifinal game the Terps were narrowly defeated by the Michigan State Spartans 64\u201361. For the NCAA tournament the Terrapins were selected as the No. 5 seed in the South region. They survived the South Dakota State Jackrabbits 79\u201374 in the first round.  In the second round they defeated a Hawaii team hot off of an upset of the 4 seeded California Golden Bears 73\u201360. In the Sweet 16 they were ousted by a superior Kansas Jayhawks team 79\u201363. Altogether the 2015\u20132016 team is regarded as a disappointment given their preseason ranking and the fact that they only reached the Sweet 16. However they put Maryland back on the map nationally and showed that the program was going to be a force in the Big Ten.\nThe 2016\u20132017 squad entered the season with many questions. 1st team all Big-Ten point guard Melo Trimble was the only remaining starter, and only 3 other players received significant play time. Lack of depth allowed a freshman trio of Anthony Cowan Jr, Kevin Huerter, and Justin Jackson to start in almost every game. The team finished with a 24\u20139 season with a conference record of 12\u20136, finishing 3rd in the Big Ten. The team had many memorable close-fought games including the season finale against Michigan State, when Melo Trimble nailed a game winning 3 with under a second remaining. The team was deemed a 6 seed in the NCAA tournament, getting knocked out in the 1st round to 11 seed Xavier.\n2017\u20132018 saw the Terps without star point guard Melo Trimble but saw Anthony Cowan Jr, Kevin Huerter, and Justin Jackson returning for their sophomore seasons. Despite this and the emergence of star freshman power forward Bruno Fernando the terps struggled to an overall record of 19\u201313 and 8\u201310 in what was considered a weak Big Ten. The season featured many close road losses that followed a pattern. This season resulted in the Terps completely missing the postseason for the first time since the 2013\u20132014 season.\nThe 2018\u20132019 season team entered the season with high anticipation locally thanks to returning stars Cowan and Fernando, as well as the addition of the 7th ranked recruiting class in country starring consensus 5-star Jalen \"Stix\" Smith. Despite a young team, the Terps outperformed national expectations and maintained a top-25 ranking for the entire 2nd half of the season. Maryland finished the 2018-2019 campaign at 22\u201310 (13\u20137 in the Big Ten), garnering a #6 seed in the NCAA tournament. The Terps survived a close battle with Dylan Windler led Belmont before losing on the last possession of the game against LSU.\n2019\u20132020 will forever be remembered by the college basketball world as the year the NCAA tournament and most conference tournaments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the Terps, the cancelled postseason hit especially hard  with Turgeon assembling his strongest team at Maryland, which finished 24\u20137 and 14\u20136 in the Big Ten. Led by first-team All Big Ten selections Anthony Cowan Jr. and Jalen \"Stix\" Smith, the Terps won a three-way share of the Big Ten regular season conference title,along with Wisconsin and Michigan State the men's program's first conference title since 2010 and its first title in the Big Ten. The Terps were ranked in the AP top ten for 22 weeks during the season, being ranked as high as No. 3 in early December and ending the season at No. 12. The season was highlighted by an emphatic 21-point win over a Marquette team led by first team All-American Marcus Howard to win the Orlando Invitational, as well as dramatic road wins against Indiana, Illinois, Michigan State, and Minnesota, which memorably ended on Darryl Morsell's deep, buzzer beating three. Indicative of the program's reemergence on the national stage, for just the second time in program history ESPN's College Gameday returned to College Park in late February for a showdown against pre-season No. 1 Michigan State. Although the Terps lost the game (their only home loss of the season), and struggled mightily in a road loss three days later at Rutgers, they rebounded in their next and final home game against Michigan to capture their share of the conference championship and cut down the nets on Cowan Jr.'s senior night. Although Maryland fans will always wonder how far the team could have gone in March, the season will be remembered fondly for the championship and Cowan Jr.'s outstanding senior season, which saw him climb to No. 7 all time in program history in points, No. 5 in assists, and included several clutch performances in wins over Illinois and MSU. The season will also be remembered for the national emergence of Smith, who was selected to multiple All-American teams and picked 10th in the 2020 NBA Draft.\n\nThe program entered the 2020\u20132021 season with low expectations, primarily due to the departures of stalwarts Anthony Cowan Jr. and Jalen Smith, as well as three transfers in Ricky Lindo Jr., Serrell Smith Jr., and Joshua Tomaic. Jalen Smith's early entry into the 2020 NBA draft was a particular issue for the team, as there were no developed big men in line to take his minutes, a glaring weakness in the Big Ten Conference. Picked to finish 10th in the Big Ten Media Poll, Turgeon had to rely on a core of four returning players, Eric Ayala, Darryl Morsell, Aaron Wiggins, and Donta Scott. Turgeon shored up his roster by securing incoming transfers Jairus Hamilton and Galin Smith. The team finished 17\u201314 and 9\u201311 in the Big Ten, good enough for an 8th-place finish in the conference. The Terps won 5 of their last 7 conference games, rising from 4\u20139 to finish 9\u201311, and defeated Michigan State 68\u201357 in the first round of the Big Ten tournament. This late season rally was enough to earn a bid to the 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a 10 seed. Matched against the 7th-seeded 2020\u201321 UConn Huskies men's basketball team, the team won their first-round game 63\u201354. They advanced to face 2 seed Alabama, who made 16 three pointers in a 96\u201377 rout. Aaron Wiggins' performance was a bright spot, as he finished with 27 points. Eric Ayala and Aaron Wiggins received Honorable Mentions for the All-Big Ten teams, and Darryl Morsell won Defensive Player of the Year.  On April 7, the University of Maryland announced Mark Turgeon's contract had been extended through the 2025\u201326 season. On December 3, 2021, Maryland and Turgeon agreed to mutually part ways. Danny Manning was named interim head coach. On March 21, 2022, Maryland hired Kevin Willard to be its tenth head coach in program history. Willard quickly went to the portal for the upcoming season picking up highly touted transfer prospect Jahmir Young from Charlotte. With Young leading the team, Maryland went 20-11, including winning the Hall of Fame Tip-Off tournament. Entering the tournament as an 8-seed, Maryland defeated 9-seeded West Virginia in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. In the second round of the tournament, they faced #1 overall seeded Alabama. They ultimately fell to the Tide 73-51, ending Kevin Willard's first season with an official record of 22-13.\n\nCoaching staff\nAll-time head coaches\nFacilities\nXfinity Center (2002\u2013present)\nThe Xfinity Center, which opened in the Fall of 2002, is the current home of the Maryland Terrapins men's and women's basketball programs. The building also features facilities for the wrestling and volleyball programs. The 17,950-seat state of the art on-campus facility is referred to as \"The House that Gary Built\" or \"Comcastle\", in reference to the arena's original name of Comcast Center, used from 2002 to July 2014. Xfinity Center provides one of the best home court advantages in the nation. This is largely due to the layout of the 4,000 seat student section which consists of the first ten rows surrounding the court in addition to the west wall of the arena, simply known as \"the Wall\", which was constructed at a 35-degree incline. Several former ACC opponents referred to the arena as the toughest place to play in the ACC.\nXfinity Center opened for Midnight Madness on October 11, 2002, and the first official men's game was a 64\u201349 victory over Miami University (Ohio) on November 24, 2002.  On January 25, 2012, the court was renamed in honor of Gary Williams, the men's basketball coach who had retired the previous year.\n\nThe Xfinity Center welcomed 281,057 visitors over 16 games in its first season for an average of 17,566 which ranked 5th nationally in 2003. It was the first time Maryland had finished in the top 10  nationally in attendance since the 1976 season in which Maryland finished 4th with an average of 13,110 fans taking in games at Cole Field House. Every year from 2004 to 2010, Maryland finished between 4th and 9th nationally in attendance.  \nAt the conclusion of the 2015\u20132016 season, Maryland is 205\u201342 (.830) all-time at Xfinity Center. Since 2003, Maryland has defeated 17 ranked opponents at Xfinity Center, including 11 top-ten teams, eight top-5 teams, and a top-ranked team (Duke University in 2003).\n\nCole Field House (1955\u20132002)\nPrior to 2002, the Terps spent 47 seasons\u2014from 1955 to 2002\u2014at Cole Field House. When college basketball was achieving its most explosive growth \u2013 from the late 1950s to the late 1970s \u2013 there was one college gymnasium on the East Coast that seated as many as 12,000 fans. Cole Field House epitomized the new big-time, main event status of college hoops, the sport of network TV and emerging legends. It was a building where history was routinely made, and fans could feel the echo of tradition and experience the electricity of top-flight college basketball. Additional seats were installed throughout the years to bring the final capacity to 14,596 (in 1993).\nCole Field House held its first East Regional finals in 1962, when NYU defeated St. John's in the final, 94\u201385. The Final Four was first held here in 1966 between Duke, Kentucky, Texas Western (now UTEP), and Utah. Texas Western (which started all black players) upset Kentucky's all-white team 72\u201365 in front of a crowd of 14,253. Future Maryland men's basketball coach Gary Williams, then a student, attended the game. Cole also hosted the Final Four in 1970 and is the nation's only on-campus arena to host multiple Final Fours.\nBud Millikan, the first Maryland coach at the venue, did not like its size saying at one point \"It's like playing on a neutral court\" with seats too far from the courts.  In the late 1960s Lefty Driesell added a nearly 3,000 seats around the court raising the hometown decibel level. Upon adding additional seating to create a more intimate atmosphere with fans right along the court, Cole would develop into one of the best home court advantages in the country. Along with Notre Dame's Joyce Athletic Center, Cole is the site of the most upsets of top ranked opponents of any venue in college basketball. 7 No. 1 ranked teams have been upset inside Cole, with Maryland pulling the upset in 6 of those 7 games and the other being Texas Western's National Championship win over Kentucky in 1966.\nCole Field House was constructed in 1955 at a cost of $3.3 million. On December 2, 1955, Maryland played its first game at Cole beating rival Virginia 67\u201355. In 1972 the attendance record would be set as 15,287 fans packed into Cole and watched Maryland knock off North Carolina 79\u201377 in overtime. The final regular season game of the 2001 season at Cole saw Maryland defeat Virginia 102\u201367 for the most lopsided result in the rivalry's history. In 2002, in a game known amongst Maryland fans as the \"Oh, He Steal\" game, the 7th #1 ranked team would fall in Cole, as Maryland handed Duke an 87\u201373 defeat, taking over first place in the conference. Later that season Maryland would play its final game in Cole Field House, celebrating the regular season conference title with a 112\u201392 win over Virginia. Over 47 seasons, Maryland compiled an impressive 486\u2013151 record at Cole Field House.\n\nRivalries\nDuke\nThe Duke\u2013Maryland basketball rivalry is a dormant college basketball rivalry between the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team of Duke University and Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team of the University of Maryland. The basketball series has been called one of the most intense intercollegiate rivalries of modern times by some. A Harris Interactive poll of Marylanders ranked it the third best in the state behind the Commanders\u2013Cowboys and Ravens\u2013Commanders rivalries in 2003 (before the Beltway Series of the Orioles and Nationals was possible). In 2014, Maryland left the ACC for the Big Ten and regular season games between Maryland and Duke are no longer scheduled regularly.\n\nVirginia\nThanks to the proximity of these two long-time ACC members, and their status as Tobacco Road outsiders, Maryland and Virginia have a long-standing rivalry that spans many decades. Traditionally, these two schools would meet in the last game of the season, and they both acted as spoilers to the other as they sought conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances. This rivalry has been dormant in recent years however, thanks to Maryland's move to the Big Ten Conference, though they did match up in the 2014 ACC-Big Ten Challenge, a 76\u201365 win for the Cavaliers in College Park, Maryland. On November 28, 2018, the rivalry was again renewed for the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, with Virginia winning by a score of 76\u201371.\nBeginning in the 2025-2026 season, Virginia and Maryland will meet yearly as part of a court-game series, renewing the Terps' oldest and most-played rivalry game. The Terrapins lead the all-time series 107\u201376.\n\nNorth Carolina\nThe Maryland-North Carolina rivalry peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s when both programs were fixtures in the AP poll and legendary coaches Lefty Driesell of Maryland and Dean Smith of the Tar Heels patrolled the sidelines. Although the rivalry cooled towards the end of the Terps ACC era, it still produced some memorable moments. The schools reunited for an ACC-Big Ten Challenge matchup in 2015, with the Tar Heels winning the top ten battle 89\u201382. In 2017 the rivalry was renewed off the court, as part of the wider University of North Carolina academic-athletic scandal. Maryland president Wallace Loh stated that he believed UNC basketball should receive the Death Penalty as punishment. In response UNC coach Roy Williams called Loh a \"double idiot\".\n\nGeorgetown\nMaryland and Georgetown have competed 49 times, the 10th most played opponent all-time for both Georgetown and Maryland. Maryland leads the all-time series 34\u201315. The two schools played each other every season from 1950 to 1980. The schools stopped playing in 1980 because of bad blood between head coaches John Thompson and Lefty Driesell, the two resumed play for one season in 1993 before taking a 22-game scheduled hiatus. The teams met twice in unplanned games during the gap, 2001 NCAA tournament for a sweet sixteen matchup, and again in 2008 for an Old Spice Classic early season matchup. In 2015 and 2016 the rivalry was renewed for the Gavitt Tipoff Games.\nThe rivalry will be renewed during the 2025-2026 season as part of a four-year, four-game series.\n\nMichigan State\nMichigan State has emerged as one of Maryland's top rivals since the Terrapins moved to the Big Ten conference in 2014. The two schools have competed 16 times, including twice in the NCAA tournament in 2003 and 2010 while Maryland was still a member of the ACC. Michigan State won both NCAA tournament games by two points each, including a heartbreaking loss in 2010 on a last second three pointer. The 2010 loss struck deep as it ended the stellar 4-year career of Greivis V\u00e1squez and denied coach Williams an open path to a third Final Four. Since Maryland joined the Big Ten, the two teams have produced memorable moments including Melo Trimble's buzzer beating three in his final home game in 2017 and Anthony Cowan Jr.'s three straight threes in the final minutes to close out a comeback win at MSU in 2020. MSU coach Tom Izzo earned the ire of Terp fans in 2015 after complaining that Trimble received too many favorable foul calls during his freshman year, a move that many believe led to officials not calling blatant fouls against Trimble in his sophomore and junior seasons. Adding to the Terps' tourney heartbreaks against Sparty, MSU won conference tournament semi-finals against Maryland in 2015 and 2016 by a combined seven points, the latter of which ended on a non-call when Trimble was apparently fouled driving to the basket down one point with two seconds left. Adding to the last second heartbreaks Tre Holloman hit a last second buzzer beater from beyond halfcourt to beat Maryland 58-55. Michigan State currently leads the all-time series 17\u20138.\n\nMichigan\nA rivalry has begun to brew between the Maryland Terrapins and the Michigan Wolverines. Since Maryland joined the Big Ten, both teams have been contending for the conference championship, with Maryland coming out on top in 2020, and Michigan topping the table in 2021. The rivalry advanced during the 2020\u20132021 season. Star Michigan freshman Hunter Dickinson, who played high school basketball close to Maryland's campus, made comments that he felt \"disrespected\" by the Terps for having not recruited him and other DMV players harder while they were in high school. In his first game against the Terps, he scored 26 points, and frequently stared down the Maryland bench and Coach Turgeon. Michigan went to claim the regular season title. However, tensions boiled over in their match-up in the 2021 Big Ten Men's Basketball Championship, where head coach Juwan Howard was ejected after receiving a double technical after an altercation with Mark Turgeon and the Terrapin team. Howard claimed that Turgeon \"charged at him\" and made derogatory comments about him and the University of Michigan Basketball scandal, but Turgeon refuted those claims, saying \"I stood up for myself and my program and said 'Don't talk to me', and then [the situation] escalated. The all-time series is 10\u201314, leaning to Michigan.\n\nWisconsin\nWisconsin has also emerged as one of Maryland's top rivals since the Terrapins have joined the Big Ten in 2014. While Maryland was still in the ACC, Wisconsin and Maryland  played in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge in Milwaukee in November of 2000, where Wisconsin won by 3 in overtime. The two teams also met in the second round of the 2002 NCAA Tournament, which Maryland won by 30 points before going on to win its first National Championship. Once Maryland joined the Big Ten, the schools continued to deliver exciting games. For example, #14 Maryland beat #5 Wisconsin in 2015, but in 2016, they split their series, each delivering the other crushing defeats in their home arenas which included a Melo Trimble game-winning 3 pointer and a confrontation between Diamond Stone and Vitto Brown. Wisconsin knocked Maryland out of the Big Ten Tournament in 2018, a trend which continued into 2024. In their lone meeting of the 2019-2020 season, #17 Maryland lost on a buzzer beater to unranked Wisconsin, and both teams would go on to win shares of the 2020 Big Ten Regular Season title. Unranked Maryland beat #6 Wisconsin in the 2020-21 season, but Wisconsin would go on to win the next 3 match-ups. In 2025, Unranked Maryland and their beloved \"Crab Five\" beat #17 Wisconsin at home during their Gold Rush game, and would prevail ahead of them in the final Big Ten standings by 1 game, as both teams enjoyed strong seasons. The schools have met 24 times, with a 9-15 series leaning to Wisconsin.\n\nHistorical statistics\n*1988 tournament records vacated by NCAA due to use of ineligible player\n\nRecord against Big Ten opponents\nTotals through February 20, 2025\n\nSeason-by-season results\nPost-season results\nNCAA tournament\nComplete NCAA tournament results\nThe Terrapins have appeared in the NCAA tournament 30* (29) times.

  "Memphis Tigers": {
    "biography": "The Memphis Tigers men's basketball team represents the University of Memphis in NCAA Division I men's college basketball. The Tigers have competed in the American Conference since 2013. As of 2020, the Tigers had the 26th highest winning percentage in NCAA history. While the Tigers have an on-campus arena, Elma Roane Fieldhouse (which is still the primary home for Tigers women's basketball), the team has played home games off campus since the mid-1960s. The Tigers moved to the Mid-South Coliseum at the Memphis Fairgrounds in 1966, and then to downtown Memphis at The Pyramid, initially built for the team in 1991 and later home to the NBA's Memphis Grizzlies. In 2004, both teams moved to a new downtown venue, FedExForum. ESPN Stats and Information Department ranked Memphis as the 19th most successful basketball program from 1962 to 2012 in their annual 50 in 50 list.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe predecessor of the University of Memphis, West Tennessee State Normal School, first put a basketball team on the court in 1920. Zach Curlin began coaching the team in 1924. The Tigers joined the Mississippi Valley Conference in 1928. The team played its early home games at a local high school gym, a local YMCA, and in a room on campus called the \"Normal Cage\" which allowed only six inches from the court lines to the walls. In 1929, a $100,000 facility on campus named Memorial Gym became the Tigers' home.\nCurlin's last season coaching the Tigers was in 1948, by which time the school had been renamed Memphis State College; it would become Memphis State University in 1957. His successor was McCoy Tarry. In 1951, the new $700,000 Fieldhouse gym was opened for Tiger home games. In 1952, John Wallesea became the first Memphis State player to be drafted by the NBA. Forest Arnold became the school's first All-American in 1954. The Tigers made the NCAA tournament for the first time, in 1955, under coach Eugene Lambert. Bob Vanatta became the team's coach in 1956 and took the Tigers to the NIT final. Win Wilfong became the team's second All-American in 1957.\nIn 1962, Dean Ehlers took over coaching duties. The Tigers began playing its home games at the Mid-South Coliseum in 1964. Moe Iba became the team's coach in 1966, the same year the team joined the Missouri Valley Conference. Iba's four years running the program are considered the low point in the history of Memphis basketball, with the team suffering 19 and 20 loss seasons before Iba's dismissal.  However, the Tigers did not remain down for long.\n\n1970s\nIn 1970, Gene Bartow was named head coach. The 1970 season also saw the first games of Larry Finch and Ronnie Robinson, two all-time greats. Larry Finch scored 24 points in his first appearance as a freshman. In 1971, the Tigers led by Finch and Robinson upset conference rival Louisville. At 11\u20132, they were ranked #19 after not reaching the Top 20 in a decade. Early in the 1971\u20131972 season, Memphis State fell in a heart breaker to No. 2 Marquette after leading by five points with five minutes to go. After defeating Louisville in Freedom Hall, the Tigers shared the Missouri Valley Conference title in 1972 with Louisville. Louisville won a playoff to represent the MVC in the NCAA Tournament while the Tigers went to the NIT for their fifth time.\nDuring the 1972\u201373 season, seniors Finch and Robinson led the Tigers to one of their most successful seasons. Memphis State won the MVC outright in 1972 after winning 14 straight games. They went to the NCAA tournament where they handily beat South Carolina and Kansas State after a first round bye to reach the Final Four. After beating Providence, the Tigers went to play for the national championship against the UCLA Bruins led by legendary coach John Wooden and led by star Bill Walton. Keeping it close in the first half, the Tigers were overwhelmed in the second half eventually losing by 21, 87\u201366. Bartow won the NABC National Coach of the Year award that season and Larry Finch was named a consensus All-American. Also on the Finals team was Larry Kenon who went on to be a 2-time All-Star in the NBA. He remains one of the most successful NBA players in Memphis history. Wayne Yates took over for Bartow in 1974 when Bartow left for Illinois. Yates led Memphis State to three straight 20-win seasons, including an NCAA Tournament berth in 1976. The Tigers left the Missouri Valley Conference to become one of the inaugural members of the Metro Conference in 1976. Dana Kirk became head coach in 1979.\n\n1980s\nIn the 1980s, the Tigers made seven NCAA tournaments and won three Metro Conference titles, amassing a record of 230\u201387 (.726). Keith Lee began playing for the Tigers in 1982, and Memphis was ranked number one in both major national polls for the first time the same year. However, that same night they were knocked off by Virginia Tech 69\u201356 in Blacksburg. In the 1983 NCAA tournament, the Tigers beat Georgetown led by Patrick Ewing, whom Lee dominated in the paint. They lost their next game to top-seed Houston led by Hakeem Olajuwon.\nAfter finishing 24\u20133 in the regular season, the 1984\u20131985 season proved to be another memorable one in Tiger history. Lee eventually led the team to another NCAA tournament in 1985. Memphis State beat Penn, UAB, Boston College and Oklahoma to reach the school's second Final Four. They were defeated by eventual champion Villanova and finished the season 31\u20134. All but one of the 12 players on this team were from the Memphis metro area. Lee was named a consensus All-American for the third time in his four-year career. In 1986, Kirk was forced out after becoming the subject of a criminal investigation. He was also found to have committed many NCAA violations as well. The Tigers were forced to sit out the 1987 NCAA tournament and were stripped of all of their NCAA tournament appearances from 1982 to 1986, including the 1985 Final Four run. Kirk's top assistant, Larry Finch, one of the leaders of the fabled 1972\u201373 team, took over head coaching duties in 1986. One of Finch's first recruits, Elliot Perry, began playing for the team in 1987. Perry led Memphis State to the 1988 and 1989 NCAA Tournaments and was drafted to the NBA where he became a successful player. In the 1988\u201389 season, the Tigers set a school record by starting the game against arch-rival Louisville with a 24\u20130 run.\n\n1990s\nIn 1990, Finch landed the country's highest rated high school recruit, Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway. The Tigers also moved to the Great Midwest Conference and began playing their home games at the new Pyramid Arena (affectionately known as the \"Tomb of Doom\") in 1991. Stand-out Hardaway led Memphis State to the 1992 NCAA tournament, where the Tigers were defeated in the Elite Eight by rival Cincinnati. The following summer, Hardaway was named All-American and earned a chance to train with the Dream Team before the Barcelona Olympics. During the 1992\u201393 season, Hardaway earned Memphis State's first triple-double and then the first back-to-back triple-doubles in wins over Georgia State and Vanderbilt. On February 6, 1993, the school achieved its 1,000th all-time basketball victory in an upset over No. 4 Cincinnati. After the season, Penny Hardaway left for the NBA draft where he was selected third overall by the Golden State Warriors. He became the most successful NBA player in history to matriculate from the Memphis basketball program. In 1994, Memphis State changed its name to the University of Memphis.\nIn 1995, the Memphis team included future NBA players David Vaughn, Cedric Henderson, and Lorenzen Wright, and they made it to the 1995 NCAA tournament where they lost in the Sweet Sixteen. Memphis joined Conference USA in 1995 as a founding member with long-time rivals Louisville and Cincinnati. Finch stepped down as head coach in 1997 and Tic Price took over thereafter. Price's three years were one of the Tigers' least successful since the 1960s.  He was forced to resign just days before the start of the 1999\u20132000 season after school officials discovered he was involved in an inappropriate relationship with a student at the university. Johnny Jones spent one year as interim head coach while the school looked for a replacement.\n\n2000s\nJohn Calipari was named Memphis' head coach in 2000. Under his leadership, the Tigers won the 2002 NIT championship, then made the NCAA tournament in 2003 and 2004. The Tigers left The Pyramid to play home games in the FedExForum in 2004. The 2005\u201306 Tigers were led by Darius Washington, Shawne Williams and Rodney Carney and set a school record by going 30\u20133 and reaching a No. 3 ranking during a regular season that was capped by a Conference USA championship. In the 2006 NCAA tournament, the Tigers received a number one seed, and they advanced to the Elite Eight before falling to eventual tournament runner-up UCLA.\nDespite losing their top three scorers from the prior season to the NBA and graduation, the 2006\u201307 Tigers duplicated the previous year's regular season record of 30\u20133, were ranked as high as No. 5, and again won the Conference USA championship, going undefeated in conference play. The Tigers earned a number two seed in the 2007 NCAA tournament. The Tigers defeated 15 seed North Texas in the first round, 7 seed Nevada in the second round, and 3 seed Texas A&M in the Sweet Sixteen, and lost to 1 seed and eventual tournament runner-up Ohio State in the Elite Eight.\n\nThe 2007\u201308 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team achieved a No. 1 ranking in the Associated Press basketball poll in January 2008, the school's first No. 1 ranking in the poll since 1982, and went on to win their third straight Conference USA title on March 15, 2008. After a month, they lost this ranking when they were defeated by in-state rival and No. 2-ranked Tennessee at home. Led by First-Team All-American Chris Douglas-Roberts and future No. 1 overall pick Derrick Rose, the team received a No. 1 seed in the 2008 NCAA tournament and defeated No. 16 seed Texas-Arlington in round one, No. 8 seed Mississippi State in round two, and No. 5 seed Michigan State in the Sweet Sixteen. Memphis convincingly defeated No. 2 seed Texas in the Elite Eight round to advance to the school's first Final Four since 1985. Following this win, Memphis went on to beat No. 1 seed UCLA on April 5, 2008, advancing to the National Championship game on April 7, 2008. With this win, Memphis became the first team in NCAA history to achieve 38 wins in a single season. After holding a nine-point lead with two minutes and 12 seconds left in regulation, the Tigers lost to Kansas in the National Championship in overtime by the final score of 75\u201368, becoming the second NCAA runner-up team in Memphis history.\nThe 2008\u201309 Tigers, led by another freshman guard, Tyreke Evans, again went undefeated in Conference USA and earned a two seed in the 2009 NCAA tournament. The Tigers were defeated by the No. 3-seed Missouri Tigers in the Sweet Sixteen. Evans left after one year and was named NBA Rookie of the Year in 2010, the second straight Tiger to do so after Rose. On March 31, 2009, Calipari resigned to become the head coach at the University of Kentucky. In the months following Calipari's departure, nearly all of the incoming recruits who had committed to play basketball for the University of Memphis decommitted from Memphis and committed to Kentucky or other schools. The recruits included Xavier Henry, DeMarcus Cousins, Nolan Dennis, and Darnell Dodson.\nOn May 28, 2009, the NCAA formally accused the Tigers of allowing an ineligible player to participate in their games during the 2007\u201308 season. On August 20, 2009, the NCAA Committee on Infractions announced that Memphis must vacate all 38 wins for that season as well as their appearance in the NCAA tournament and spend three years on probation. The NCAA alleged that Derrick Rose, a Chicago native, had obtained a fraudulent SAT score when another person took the test for him in Detroit, Michigan and his brother Reggie Rose was provided nearly $1,700 in free travel and lodging with the Memphis team.  The University of Memphis was not charged with knowingly fielding an ineligible player given that Rose had originally been cleared by the testing company and the NCAA. Rather, the NCAA imposed the penalty on a \"strict liability\" standard which held that Memphis must vacate their wins regardless of whether the school had any knowledge of wrongdoing by Rose and regardless of the NCAA's original clearance of Rose.\n\n2010s \u2013 present\nOn April 7, 2009, Josh Pastner was named the team's head coach. Pastner was hired as an assistant at Memphis in 2008 after serving as an assistant coach under Lute Olson at Arizona for six years. Pastner gained a reputation as a strong recruiter during his tenure at Arizona. In his first year as coach at Memphis, Pastner brought in Elliot Williams, a transfer from Duke, who led the team in scoring and was drafted to the NBA. Williams was permitted to play his first season after departing Calipari took with him Memphis' top-ranked recruiting class. In 2011 Pastner led the Tigers back to the NCAA tournament for the first time in his coaching career, though they lost in the first round to his former team, Arizona.\nDuring the 2011\u201312 season, the Tigers announced they were leaving Conference USA to join the Big East Conference starting in 2013 (later renamed the American Athletic Conference, and now known as the American Conference). They began the season strong, moving as high to No. 13 in the country before falling out of the rankings (a phenomenon which would become a recurrent theme of the Pastner era). In the last game of the season, Josh Pastner's victory over Tulsa gave him 72 career victories, the most by a Memphis head coach over his first three seasons. Memphis made its second straight NCAA Tournament after winning the Conference USA tournament. An 8-seed, the Tigers lost in the first round to 9-seeded Saint Louis. After the season, sophomore star Will Barton left for the NBA.\nIn 2012\u201313, the Tigers, led by CUSA player of the year Joe Jackson, won the Conference USA regular season and tournament titles in their last season in CUSA. The Tigers began competition in the then newly formed American Athletic Conference in 2013. AAC competition was not as kind to the Pastner-led Tigers, as they earned an NCAA tournament berth in only 1 of the team's first 3 seasons in the AAC.\nOn April 8, 2016, facing mounting criticism in Memphis, Pastner took the job of head men's basketball coach at Georgia Tech.  A few days later, the Tigers hired Tubby Smith to take over the head coaching job. Smith had just won the Big 12 coach of the year award as well as some national coaching awards for his season at Texas Tech.\nSmith was fired on March 14, 2018 after failing to reach the NCAA Tournament in both of his two years as head coach. Penny Hardaway was later confirmed as Smith's replacement.\nOn March 28, 2021, the Tigers won their second NIT tournament with a 77\u201365 win over the #4 seed Mississippi State Bulldogs, finishing their season at 20\u20138.\nOn June 11, 2021 speculation began to circulate that Penny Hardaway was a candidate for multiple head coaching jobs in the NBA, including his former team the Orlando Magic. On June 28, reports emerged that Hardaway had in fact interviewed and emerged as a top candidate for the Magic's vacant head coaching job. Two days later, via Instagram, Hardaway confirmed he was not leaving the University of Memphis, and reports emerged the same day that Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown had accepted an offer to be his assistant.  Brown was an assistant coach for the 2021-22 season, but changed his role to advisor for the 2022-23 season, and left the program for health reasons in December 2022.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Tigers have appeared in the NCAA Tournament 28 times.

However, wins in 1982\u20131986 and 2008 have been vacated.\n\n* = vacated by NCAA\n\nNIT results\nThe Tigers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 19 times.

Of the 52 drafted players, 28 played in at least one NBA (or ABA) game. Memphis has produced 14 first-round picks, including 8 top-ten picks and one number-one pick (Derrick Rose). Three former Tigers have been named NBA All-Stars: Larry Kenon (twice), Penny Hardaway (4 times), and Derrick Rose (3 times). Four have gone on to win the NBA Championship: Win Wilfong with the St. Louis Hawks in 1958, William Bedford with the Detroit Pistons in 1990, Earl Barron with the Miami Heat in 2006, and James Wiseman with the Golden State Warriors in 2022. In 2010, Memphis became the second college to produce two consecutive NBA Rookie of the Year winners: Derrick Rose in 2009 and Tyreke Evans in 2010 (the first being North Carolina with winners Walter Davis in 1978 and Phil Ford in 1979). In 2011, Rose became the first former Tiger to be named the NBA Most Valuable Player.

    "biography": "The Miami Hurricanes men's basketball team is the college basketball team of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. The team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\nThe University of Miami men's basketball team was formed in 1926, but the program was later dropped by the university in 1971. In 1985, 14 years later, the Hurricanes resumed play as an independent and joined the Big East Conference in 1991, winning the Big East regular season title in 2000. In 2004, in conjunction with the rest of the Miami athletic program, the team moved to the ACC.\nIn 2012\u20132013, the team won its first regular season ACC championship and its first ACC championship. In the 2014\u20132015 season, they reached the final of the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The team has reached the NCAA Championship's Sweet 16 five times (1999\u20132000, 2012\u20132013, 2015\u20132016, 2021\u20132022, and 2022\u20132023), the Elite Eight twice (2021\u20132022 and 2022\u20132023), and the Final Four once (2022\u20132023).\nThe Hurricanes are currently coached by Jai Lucas, who was named head coach following Jim Larra\u00f1aga's resignation and play their home games at the Watsco Center.\n\nHistory\nBill Foster era (1985\u20131990)\nLeonard Hamilton era (1990\u20132000)\nPerry Clark era (2000\u20132004)\nPerry Clark took over the program at Miami in 2000 and spent four seasons with the Hurricanes, where he led them to a 65\u201354 (.546) record. In his first three seasons with the program, he accumulated 51 wins, the most ever by a Hurricane coach, and became the only Miami coach to take the Hurricanes to the postseason in each of his first two seasons.\nClark's 2001\u201302 Hurricane squad finished 24\u20138 and received the school's fourth NCAA Tournament berth and set a school record for wins in a season. Included in the 24 wins were a school-record 14 consecutive victories to open the season. His Hurricanes were not ranked in the preseason, but were ranked for the final 13 weeks of the campaign, ending the year No. 21 according to the Associated Press.\n\nFrank Haith era (2004\u20132011)\nFrank Haith was hired on April 11, 2004 and tasked with leading the Hurricanes into the Atlantic Coast Conference.  In his first season, Haith took a team that was coming off two straight losing seasons and picked to finish last in the ACC and guided it to the postseason for the first time since 2002.  As a result, Haith was a finalist for the Naismith National Coach of the Year Award.\nHaith again took Miami to the NIT in 2005, and the Hurricanes won their first two games before bowing out in a loss to the Michigan Wolverines.  It was just the second time in Miami's basketball history that the Hurricanes had won back-to-back postseason games.\nHaith reached just one NCAA tournament as the head coach at Miami, leading the Hurricanes to a second-round appearance in 2008. The next season, Haith's team returned four starters, including sharpshooter Jack McClinton. Miami began the season ranked 16th in the USA Today/ESPN pre-season poll, and the media picked it to finish fourth in the ACC. However, Miami finished below .500 in conference play and missed the NCAA tournament, instead participating in the NIT. The following season, Haith's team finished in last place in the ACC.\nHaith has also led the Hurricanes to success off-the-court. Under Haith's tenure, all eight Miami senior basketball players who have completed their eligibility have earned their degrees. Miami also placed three players on the ACC All-Academic basketball team for the 2004\u20132005 season, more than any school in the conference.\n\nJim Larra\u00f1aga era (2011\u20132024)\nOn April 22, 2011, Jim Larra\u00f1aga accepted the head coaching position at the University of Miami. In his first season at Miami, he led the team to a 9\u20137 record in-conference. It marked the school's first ever winning record in the ACC.\n\nIn his second season, Larra\u00f1aga led the Hurricanes to arguably their best season since the Rick Barry era. They won the ACC regular-season title (the first time in 11 years, and only the fourth time in 32 years, that a team from North Carolina had not won at least a share of the title). The highlight of the season was an unprecedented 90\u201363 rout of #1 ranked Duke. That win was Miami's first-ever defeat of a top-ranked team, and the largest margin of defeat for a #1 team ever.\nOn March 17, 2013, Larra\u00f1aga coached the Hurricanes to the ACC tournament title\u2014the first tournament title in the program's history \u2014 with an 87\u201377 win over North Carolina. On April 4, 2013, Larra\u00f1aga was voted the Associated Press' college basketball coach of the year. A week later, the Hurricanes advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament with their school-record 29th win. The season ended the following weekend with a loss to Marquette. He claimed the Hurricanes had not enough energy to win the game because of Reggie Johnson's injury and Shane Larkin's sickness.\nSince the mid-2010s, Miami men's basketball under Larra\u00f1aga has become a routine contender in the ACC and nationally. In 2022, Miami made their first Elite Eight in program history, only falling short against eventual national champions Kansas. In the 2023 tournament, the Hurricanes made an even bigger leap, overcoming top regional seed Houston and second-seeded Texas en route to the program's first-ever Final Four.  However, in the Final Four, they again ran into the eventual champions, this time falling to UConn. In 2024, with expectations still high, Miami started strong, starting out 15\u20137, but they finished the season with 10 straight losses, resulting in a 15\u201317 record, ultimately missing out on the postseason.\nFollowing a 4\u20138 start to the 2024\u201325 season, Larra\u00f1aga announced he was stepping down from his head coaching position on December 26, 2024, with associate head coach Bill Courtney being named interim head coach for the remainder of the season.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Hurricanes have appeared in the NCAA tournament 12 times. Their combined record is 15\u201312.\n\nNIT results\nThe Hurricanes have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 12 times.

It was founded in 2011. Prior to Storm Surge's creation, Miami had been victim to years of inconsistent student attendance and a lack of student interest in the basketball program, and prior attempts to create a lasting student section such as \"UBeach\" and \"Haith's Faithful\" were largely unsuccessful. Storm Surge works directly with Miami's athletic department to enhance the game day experience and encourage greater involvement from the student body. Storm Surge began with 500 members, but saw average student attendance jump to over 1,100 for ACC games in 2012\u20132013, its second season. As student capacity at the BUC is limited, students are admitted on a first-come, first-served basis, with students often arriving hours beforehand or camping out to get the best seats.\n\nTraditions\nStorm Surge has become famous for its creative and unique free throw chants and distractions, digging up embarrassing facts and pictures of opposing players, and its slogan, \"Pack The BUC,\" which can be seen on T-shirts, signs, and promotional materials at University of Miami home games. Like many student sections, Storm Surge distributes cheer sheets prior to each game, detailing specific cheers for that game. The group also has the ability to create cheers on the fly through the use of a large whiteboard at the front of the student section, which is used to coordinate all cheers.\nStorm Surge's official color is orange, and all members wear orange to every game. The student section is situated behind both baskets and consists of bleacher seating and traditional seating. As bleacher seating is closest to the floor, the students in the bleachers are typically the team's biggest supporters. Before each game, Storm Surge sings the national anthem together, even if the anthem is being sung by an individual performer. During opposing teams' introductions, students turn around to face away from the court and throw up \"The U.\" During Miami's home introductions, the student section links arms and rocks left to right, going faster and faster before erupting into cheers for the Hurricanes. For Miami's free throws, students hold up one finger, all jumping once on a made free throw and twice on the second free throw if both free throws are made.\nStorm Surge also organizes watch parties and live online blogs for every away game. These events are open to all students and typically take place on campus. Following major road wins, the group gathers at the BankUnited Center to greet and congratulate the returning Hurricanes team, a tradition that has since carried over to football. Membership in the organization also entitles students to exclusive meet and greets with players, priority seating to games, and promotions and giveaways.\n\nLarra\u00f1aga Lawn\nIn 2013, due to unprecedented demand for student tickets to the January 23 game against the #1 ranked Duke Blue Devils, students camped out on an adjacent field to the BankUnited Center, which was promptly dubbed \"Larra\u00f1aga Lawn,\" after Coach Jim Larra\u00f1aga. Students camped out for several other games during the 2012\u20132013 season, including sold out contests against FSU and UNC. Coach Jim Larra\u00f1aga and members of the team always greet students lined up on Larra\u00f1aga Lawn both the night before the game and again on game day, often bringing food to students in line. Lawn sports such as football, frisbee, and Kan-jam have become popular ways for students in line to pass the time on Larra\u00f1aga Lawn.\n\nNational attention\nStorm Surge made national headlines in 2012 during Miami's home game against UNC, when students chanted \"Austin Rivers\" at UNC free throw shooter Tyler Zeller, whom Rivers had hit a buzzer beater over in UNC's previous game. Storm Surge was again in the national spotlight following Miami's 90\u201363 rout of Duke in January 2013 when students rushed the court in celebration. The student section has been praised by many notable visitors, including: Jimmy Graham, Warren Sapp, Dick Vitale, and Carlos Boozer.\nIn 2013, Storm Surge received a number of accolades, including three of the \"Best Fan Signs in College Basketball\" by USA Today and was featured on national programs such as PTI, SportsCenter, and CBS's documentary \"March Madness Fandemonium\". In addition, it was recognized as one of the toughest ACC venues by ESPN during numerous broadcasts throughout the season. On January 24, 2013, Storm Surge was featured on the front page of The Miami Herald following Miami's win over Duke. On February 9, 2013, Storm Surge was featured on the landing page of ESPN.com following Miami's blowout home win over UNC.\nAfter losing its flair following some up-and-down seasons, the student section was renamed to \"The Eye\" at the start of the 2021-22 season. More about The Eye can be found on Category 5's page, which is the University of Miami's official student school spirit organization.\n\nFacilities\nMiami Beach Convention Center\nThe Miami Hurricanes played their home games at the Miami Beach Convention Center from 1956-1971.\n\nJames L. Knight Center (1985\u20131988)\nOn November 12, 1985, the Knight Sports Complex was dedicated at a gala banquet that was held on the basketball courts of the new structure. CBS basketball analyst Billy Packer served as the evening\u2019s guest speaker for an event that welcomed more than 500 guests to the on-campus home of Hurricane basketball. The facility served as the practice home to the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball programs, while also housing the men\u2019s basketball coaching staff offices until the team moved to Miami Arena in 1988. In addition, the Knight Sports Complex enabled the athletic program to more than double the size of the existing strength room, while also providing meeting rooms and lecture rooms for all of Miami\u2019s student-athletes.\n\nMiami Arena (1988\u20132002)\nThe Hurricanes called Miami Arena home from 1988 until December 2002. The downtown arena attracted large crowds for marquee opponents as the program began play in the Big East Conference in 1991. The school shared the facility with the NBA's Miami Heat and the NHL's Florida Panthers until each respective professional franchise built newer stadiums.\n\nWatsco Center (2002\u2013present)\nAfter years of planning, Hurricanes basketball finally moved on-campus on January 4, 2003 when the Hurricanes defeated No. 22 North Carolina in overtime to christen the opening of the Convocation Center (nicknamed the \"Convo\"). The $48 million facility was funded through private donations, though was later renamed the BankUnited Center in 2005. In 2016, the University announced the renaming of the facility as the Watsco Center.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "biography": "The Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Michigan State University. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference of NCAA Division I college basketball. The Spartans have won two NCAA National championships,  17 Big Ten Regular Season Championships, and 6 Big Ten Tournament Championships. Their home games are played at the Jack Breslin Student Events Center (\"Breslin Center\") in East Lansing, Michigan. Tom Izzo has been the head coach since 1995. \nTheir two national championships came in the 1979 NCAA tournament and the 2000 NCAA tournament. The 1979 national championship game was the most watched college basketball game in history, with 35.11 million television viewers. The 1979 National Championship team was coached by Jud Heathcote and included tournament MVP Magic Johnson, Greg Kelser, and Jay Vincent. The Spartans defeated the previously unbeaten Indiana State, led by future Hall of Famer Larry Bird. The 2000 National Championship team defeated Florida in the final. The team was coached by Tom Izzo and led by players Morris Peterson, Charlie Bell, Jason Richardson, and tournament MVP Mateen Cleaves.\nThe Spartans have participated in 38 NCAA tournaments (tied for 10th-most all-time) and appeared in 27 consecutive NCAA tournaments (the 2020 NCAA tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the second-longest streak ever and the longest active streak in college basketball. Michigan State has the sixth most all-time Final Four appearances with 10 (1957, 1979, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2019). The program is also ninth all-time in NCAA tournament winning percentage (.686, through 2023). Michigan State also has 15 NCAA Elite Eights (6th-most all-time), and 22 NCAA Sweet Sixteens (tied for 5th-most all-time with Indiana).\nOn February 15, 2025, Izzo set the record for most wins by a coach in Big Ten conference play with 354. On March 5, 2025, Izzo moved into a three way tie with Ward Lambert and Bob Knight for the most Big Ten regular season championships, each with 11 championship teams.\n\nTeam history\n1898\u20131954: early years\nThe first established coach for Michigan Agricultural College (MSU's name at the time), Charles Bemies was also the first athletic director in school history, while also coaching the football, baseball, and track teams. His two-year stint as basketball head coach ended in 1901. MAC's second basketball coach was George Denman. Denman is the only basketball coach to go undefeated during his tenure, posting an 11\u20130 mark during his two seasons. His team still holds the record for largest margin of victory with a 102\u20133 defeat of Alma College in 1902. MAC's first full-time athletic director and one of the Spartan's most successful coaches, Chester Brewer led the football, basketball, and baseball squads to winning records. He holds the highest winning percentage of any Spartan basketball coach with at least four seasons at .736 (70\u201325). His team also defeated Michigan in the schools\u2019 first meeting in 1909. George Gauthier was the first alumnus to lead a Michigan State basketball squad. He compiled a career record of 41\u201338 over four seasons. Gauthier left after 29 games in 1919\u2013 20, posting a 15\u201314 record. Lyman Frimodig coached the final seven games of the season, going 6\u20131. He would also serve as head coach for the next two seasons. He remained active in the athletic department after his stint as basketball coach, serving Michigan State for 41 years as assistant athletic director and business manager.\nBenjamin Van Alstyne coached MSU for 22 years from 1926 to 1949. He is third in career victories with 231. Van Alstyne coached MSU's first All-American, Roger Grove, in 1930. Some of his greatest victories included a 27\u201326 victory over Michigan in 1930 at the dedication of Demonstration Hall, and a 66\u201350 upset over Kentucky in 1945 that was named \u201cCoca-Cola Upset of the Week.\u201d His 47\u201345 loss to Kentucky in 1948 set the record for the largest crowd in Jenison Field House history.\nIn one season under Alton Kircher, the Spartans finished 4\u201318. Following the conclusion of the 1950 season, the Spartans joined the Big Ten Conference.\nPete Newell was hired from San Francisco following a successful four years with the Dons where he went 70\u201337 and won the 1949 NIT. His 1951\u201352 squad was the first ranked Spartan team and also registered a win over No. 14 Notre Dame, the first win over a ranked opponent in school history. One of his biggest wins was a 1952 defeat of No. 2-ranked Kansas State. After four seasons, California hired Newell as its head coach and MSU had to search for another coach. Newell is often considered to be one of the most influential figures in the history of basketball.\n\n1954\u20131965: Forrest \"Forddy\" Anderson era\nForrest \"Forddy\" Anderson was hired away from Bradley following a trip to the 1954 Final Four with the Braves. His Bradley team had also made it to the 1950 championship game.\nTwo years after taking over the Spartans, in 1957, he led MSU to its first Big Ten Championship. After opening the season with a 4\u20137 record, the Spartans won 10 in a row and 12-of-13 to capture their first league title and advance to the school's first NCAA tournament. A bye in the first round of the tournament preceded wins over Notre Dame and Kentucky to earn a trip to the Final Four. A loss to North Carolina in the Final Four left MSU in the national third-place game where they lost to San Francisco.\nTwo years later, led by All-American Johnny Green, the Spartans cruised to a Big Ten Championship, winning the league by four games. A win over Marquette in the 1959 NCAA tournament put MSU in the Mideast regional finals against Kentucky. The Spartans lost and fell one game short of another trip to the Final Four.\nFollowing his initial successes in East Lansing, his Spartan teams only finished with a winning record one time after 1959. He was fired following the 1964\u201365 season.\n\n1965\u20131976: post-Anderson era\nJohn Benington, who had been an assistant to Anderson at Bradley before joining his staff at MSU, took over as head coach and led MSU to a second-place Big Ten finish in his first season at the helm. The next season, he led the Spartans to a shared Big Ten title, but Indiana received the NCAA tournament bid (at that time, only one Big Ten team received an NCAA bid). After four seasons leading the Spartans, he died of a heart attack after jogging at Jenison Fieldhouse in the summer of 1969 at the age of 47.\nGus Ganakas was an assistant under Benington and was hired to take over following Benington's death. His most successful seasons were in 1973\u201374 with a fourth-place Big Ten finish and 1974\u201375 with a 17\u20139 overall record. In 1975, 10 black members of his team walked out before a game against Indiana for what was perceived at the time as a racial disagreement over starting a white player. Ganakas was fired in 1976, but he continued to be a part of the Michigan State Athletics Department, serving as an assistant A.D. and then as an aide to coach Tom Izzo from 1998 to 2000. He was an MSU basketball radio announcer until 2017. He died in 2019.\n\n1976\u20131995: Jud Heathcote era\nJud Heathcote was hired to take over as coach in 1976 from Montana by athletic director Joseph Kearney in May 1976, after coaching the Grizzlies for five years. Heathcote had led the Grizzlies to two Big Sky championships and the 1975 NCAA tournament, the Grizzlies first ever trip to the tournament. He finished his tenure at Montana with an 80\u201353 record.\nAs a virtual unknown, Heathcote came to East Lansing looking to return MSU to greatness. In his second year, he landed one of the game's all-time greats, Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, from nearby Lansing Everett High School, as a recruit. The 1977\u201378 Spartans won the Big Ten title, their first since 1967, and qualified for the NCAA tournament for only the third time in school history. They advanced to the Elite Eight and were led by Johnson and Greg Kelser. In 1979, the duo led the Spartans to a second consecutive Big Ten title and the NCAA National Championship. The NCAA championship marked the school's first in basketball.\nFollowing the championship, Johnson left school to join the NBA and Kelser graduated. The result was a ninth place finish in the Big Ten the next year and struggles thereafter. MSU returned to postseason play in 1983, finishing with a 17\u201313 record and receiving an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament.\nFollowing the expansion of the NCAA tournament to 64 teams in 1985, Heathcote returned the Spartans, led by the future MSU all-time scoring leader, Scott Skiles, to the tournament with a fifth-place finish in the Big Ten. MSU again reached the NCAA tournament the following year after finishing third in the Big Ten with a 23\u20138 record. Led by Skiles and Darryl Johnson, they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing.\nHeathcote returned MSU to postseason play in 1989, led by Steve Smith, losing the third-place game of the NIT. Smith returned the Spartans to the NCAA tournament in 1990 as a No. 1 seed. The Spartans narrowly avoided losing to No. 16-seeded Murray State, needing overtime to advance to the second round. They again narrowly advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to Georgia Tech in overtime. The Spartans also made an appearance in the 1991 NCAA tournament. The Spartans finished in third place in Big Ten play and received an at-large bid as a No. 5 seed to the tournament where they beat Green Bay on a buzzer beater by Smith. In the second round, they lost to No. 10 Utah in double overtime.\nThe Spartans made their third straight trip to the NCAA tournament in 1992. Another third-place finish in Big Ten play resulted in an at-large bid as a No. 5 seed to the NCAA tournament. There they beat Missouri State before losing to Cincinnati in the second round in a rematch of an earlier Spartan win.\nA trip to the NIT in 1993 broke the NCAA tournament streak, but Heathcote again led MSU to the NCAA tournament in 1994. A fourth-place finish the Big Ten led to an at-large bid to the Tournament as a No. 7 seed. Led by Shawn Respert, they beat Seton Hall in the first round before losing to second-seeded Duke in the second round.\nIn his final year at MSU in 1995, Heathcote returned the Spartans to the NCAA tournament for the fifth time in six years. A second-place finish in Big Ten play resulted in an at-large bid to the Tournament as a No. 3 seed where they were surprised by No. 14-seeded Weber State in the first round. The game marked the final game of All-American Shawn Respert's career at MSU.\nHeathcote stepped down in 1995 after 19 seasons at Michigan State. He finished with nine NCAA appearances, three Big Ten championships, and three NIT appearances. He hand-picked his successor, Tom Izzo. \"I had to orchestrate the hiring of Tom through (trustees) Bob Weiss and Joel Ferguson and the president (Peter McPherson) because most people wanted to open it up and see who would apply. And then some wanted a black coach,\" Heathcote said in 2014. \"But I felt Tom deserved the job because he'd been there 12 years, and he'd gotten better in the job every single year. Tom was a tireless worker and had a passion for the game. So that combination, in my mind, I knew he was going to be a good coach.\"\nIn 2001, the National Association of Basketball Coaches awarded Heathcote with the Golden Anniversary Award for 50 years of service to college basketball. Also, in 2001, he was inducted into the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame. In 2009, Heathcote was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n1995\u2013present: Tom Izzo era\nTom Izzo took over for Heathcote in 1995 after 11 years as an assistant coach under Heathcote.\nMichigan State struggled in the first season with Izzo at the helm and after losing All-American Shawn Respert. The Spartans finished the season at .500 (16\u201316, 9\u20139) and in a tie for seventh place in the Big Ten. MSU received an invitation to the NIT where they defeated Washington before losing to Fresno State in the second round. The season marked the last time MSU did not finish with a winning record.\nIn 1997, the Spartans welcomed new recruits Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson to East Lansing. Along with sophomore Antonio Smith, the three made up three-fourths of Izzo's \"Flintstones\" who would win the national championship in 2000 (without Smith). In what would be a rarity for MSU in Izzo's tenure, the Spartans played no ranked teams in the non-conference season. The Spartans finished in a tie for sixth place in the conference with a record of 16\u201311 overall and 9\u20139 in conference. They received an invitation to the NIT for the second consecutive year. MSU beat George Washington in the first round and lost in the second round to Florida State. As of 2025, this is the last year MSU failed to make the NCAA tournament.\nIn 1998, MSU welcomed freshman recruit Charlie Bell, the fourth of Izzo's \"Flintstones\" and started slow. They lost to No. 7 Temple, and suffered surprising losses to UIC and Detroit in non-conference. However, MSU won nine of their first 10 conference games before losing to eventual conference co-champion Illinois. In January, MSU entered the AP and Coaches rankings for the first time since the end of the 1994\u201395 season. The Spartans finished in a tie for the conference championship, their first since 1990, with a record of 13\u20133 in conference play. Mateen Cleaves was named Big Ten Player of the Year. The Spartans earned the No. 1 seed in the inaugural Big Ten tournament, but lost their first game in the quarterfinals to Minnesota. Izzo's team received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 4 seed in the East Region, their first trip to the Tournament since 1995. MSU advanced to their first Sweet Sixteen since 1990 by beating Eastern Michigan and No. 8 Princeton. The Spartans were eliminated from the Tournament by No. 1 North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen.\nAs the 1998\u201399 season began, Izzo began his willingness to play anyone anywhere mantra as the Spartans played three top seven teams in their first seven games. However, MSU lost all three. MSU would recover and, after losing their first Big Ten game to No. 24 Wisconsin, the Spartans won the remaining 15 games in conference and won the Big Ten conference regular season by six games with a record of 15\u20131, their second consecutive Big Ten title. For the second consecutive year, Mateen Cleaves was named Big Ten Player of the Year. The Spartans won the Big Ten tournament and earned the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.  As the No. 1 seed in the Midwest region and ranked No. 2 in the country, MSU defeated Mount St. Mary's, and Mississippi to advance to their second straight Sweet Sixteen. A win over Oklahoma and Kentucky led MSU to the Final Four for the first time since 1979. However, MSU fell short in their bid for an NCAA championship, losing to Duke in the Final Four.\nIn 1999\u20132000. Seniors Mateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson led the way for the Spartans as they began the season ranked No. 3 in the country. However, Cleaves sustained a stress fracture in his right foot prior to the season which forced him to miss the non-conference schedule and MSU fell to 9\u20134 and ranked No. 11 in the country. After Cleaves' return, MSU finished the Big Ten regular season with a 13\u20133 conference record and 23\u20137 overall while being ranked No. 2 in the country and earned a share of the Big Ten title, their third consecutive Big Ten championship. Peterson was named Big Ten Player of the Year, the third consecutive year a Spartan had received the award. The Spartans went on to win the third annual Big Ten tournament as the No. 2 seed, defeating No. 25 Illinois for the championship for the second consecutive year. The Spartans were awarded the No. 1 seed, their second consecutive No. 1 seed, in the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament. From there, the Spartans cruised to their third consecutive Sweet Sixteen with wins over Valparaiso, and Utah. MSU continued their national championship push by reaching their second consecutive Final Four with wins over Syracuse and Iowa State. MSU won every game by double digits despite playing the best possible seed in each round. In their Final Four matchup, Michigan State faced off against fellow Big Ten foe, Wisconsin, beating them in a hard-fought game, 53\u201341. In the national championship game, the Spartans triumphed over the Florida Gators 89\u201376, despite losing Cleaves to an ankle injury 3:42 into the second half. The win marked MSU's second national championship in basketball and Izzo's first and only championship to date.\nLosing both Cleaves and Peterson to graduation following the season, MSU still began the 2000\u201301 season ranked No. 3 in the country. Led by sophomore Jason Richardson, freshmen Zach Randolph, and seniors Charlie Bell and Andre Hutson, the Spartans finished the non-conference schedule undefeated and ranked No.1 in the country. MSU again earned a share the Big Ten title, their fourth consecutive, with a 13\u20133 conference record. They suffered a surprise defeat by Penn State in the Big Ten tournament in their attempt to win the tournament for the third consecutive year. They received their third consecutive No. 1 seed, in the South Region of the NCAA tournament. Seeking a repeat National Championship, MSU easily dispatched Alabama State and Fresno State to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the fourth consecutive year. A win over Gonzaga and Temple led to the school's third straight trip to the Final Four. However, they were unable to repeat as national champions, losing to Arizona in the National Semifinal. Following the season, Randolph and Richardson each left school early and declared for the NBA draft.\nAs a result of Randolph and Richardson's early departure, MSU struggled with Izzo's tough non-conference schedule in 2002. The Spartans lost four games, all to teams ranked in the top 25 and started the Big ten season with three straight losses. The loss to Wisconsin snapped MSU's 53-game home winning streak. Michigan State finished the conference schedule at 10\u20136 and in fourth place with an overall record of 19\u201310. MSU lost in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament to No. 23 Indiana marking the first time since 1997 that Michigan State did not win either the Big Ten regular season or tournament title. The Spartans received an at-large bid as a No. 10 seed in the NCAA tournament and were eliminated in the first round by NC State.\nFollowing the disappointment of an early NCAA tournament exit, the first time Izzo's squads had not won at least one game in the NCAA tournament, the 2002\u201303 team played another tough non-conference schedule. This time the Spartans faced three ranked teams, only losing one. However, they suffered four losses and finished the non-conference schedule at 8\u20134 and ranked No. 25 in the country. MSU began the Big Ten regular season losing four of their first six games and fell out of the rankings. The Spartans finished in a tie for third place in the Big Ten at 10\u20136 in conference and 18\u201311 overall. Michigan State beat Purdue in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals, but fell to Ohio State in the semifinals. The Spartans received a bid to the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year. MSU received a No. 7 seed in the South Region. A win over Colorado in the first round was followed by a rout of No. 10 Florida to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the fifth time in six years. The Spartans defeated No. 17 Maryland to advance to the Elite Eight for the fourth time in five years. However, MSU fell to No. 5 Texas in the Regional Final.\nIn 2004, Izzo looked to continue his dominant NCAA run. However, Izzo's penchant for tough scheduling hurt his team as they faced a murderer's row of a schedule which included three straight losses to No. 6 Duke, in overtime, to No. 14 Oklahoma at the Palace of Auburn Hills, and to No. 8 Kentucky at Ford Field in the Basketbowl. The Spartans followed this losing streak by losing two of their final four non-conference games including at No. 17 Syracuse and dropped out of the rankings. They finished the non-conference slate at 5\u20136. After a loss to open Big Ten play to No. 21 Wisconsin, the Spartans recovered to win seven of their next eight and six of their last seven Big Ten games. They finished in a tie for second place in the Big Ten at 12\u20134 and 17\u201310 overall. A win over Northwestern in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals was followed by a third loss of the season to No. 17 Wisconsin. The Spartans received a No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament, reaching the tournament for the seventh consecutive year. But, for the second time in three years, the Spartans were knocked out in the first round, this time by Nevada.\nIn 2005, the Spartans again looked to rebound from a disappointing early NCAA tournament exit. They started the season 3\u20132, but cruised through the Big Ten, only losing three games, including a loss to No. 1 Illinois and finished second in conference to Illinois. MSU finished the regular season with a 13\u20133 conference record and 22\u20135 overall while being ranked No. 13 in the country. The Spartans lost in the quarterfinals in the Big Ten tournament to Iowa. Michigan State received an at-large bid as a No. 5 seed in the Austin Regional of the NCAA tournament, their eighth straight appearance in the Tournament under Tom Izzo. Wins over Old Dominion and Vermont led the Spartans to the Sweet Sixteen for the sixth time in eight years. In the Sweet Sixteen, the Spartans beat No. 3-ranked and No. 1-seeded Duke, which MSU had not defeated since 1958. The win marked Izzo's first win over Duke's Mike Krzyzewski (as of 2017). A double overtime victory over Kentucky sent the Spartans to their fourth Final Four in seven seasons. MSU would again fall in the Final Four, this time to No. 2-ranked and No. 1-seeded North Carolina.\nThe 2005\u201306 Spartans opened the season with a loss to Hawaii before losing to No. 8 Gonzaga led by Adam Morrison in triple overtime in the Maui Classic. Despite this, MSU ended the non-conference schedule at 12\u20132 and ranked No. 7 in the country. Early Big Ten losses followed by late season losses in conference left the Spartans 8\u20138 in the Big Ten. In the Big Ten tournament, MSU defeated Purdue and No. 9 Illinois before being defeated by No. 20 Iowa in the semifinals. The Spartans received an at-large bid as a No. 5 seed in the NCAA tournament, their ninth consecutive trip to the Tournament. In the Tournament, they lost to eventual Final Four Cinderella, George Mason, in the first round. Following the season, Shannon Brown declared for the NBA draft, leaving the Spartans one year prior to graduation, just the fourth player under Izzo to declare early.\nThe 2006\u201307 Spartans began the season 13\u20132, but were not ranked in the polls. A roller coaster Big Ten season resulted in MSU finishing 8\u20138 with a win against No. 1 Wisconsin which likely assured the Spartans a trip to the NCAA tournament. MSU lost to Wisconsin after beating Northwestern in the Big Ten tournament. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament for the 10th consecutive year and beat Marquette, coached by former Izzo assistant Tom Crean, in the first round of the Tournament. A loss to No. 3 North Carolina in the second round ended the season.\nIn 2008, MSU finished the non-conference schedule 12\u20131 and ranked No. 6 in the country with wins over No. 24 NC State, No. 20 BYU, and No. 4 Texas. A hot start to the Big Ten schedule, winning six of seven, was followed by four losses in their next seven which left them in fourth place in the Big Ten with a record of 12\u20136. As the No. 4 seed tn the Big Ten tournament, they beat Ohio State before losing to No. 8 Wisconsin. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament to mark their 11th consecutive trip to the Tournament under Tom Izzo. As a No. 5 seed, the Spartans beat Temple, and Pittsburgh to move on to the Sweet Sixteen for the seventh time in 11 years. A rout by a Derrick Rose-led Memphis ended the season.\n\nBy the beginning of the 2008\u201309 season, Izzo's teams, though having great success in the NCAA tournament, had not won the Big Ten regular season title since 2001. A solid non-conference start left them at 9\u20132 and were ranked No. 10 in the country. MSU routed the Big Ten, winning their first five conference games, their best start in conference since 1978. MSU finished the conference season well, winning the Big Ten championship by four games with a 15\u20133 record, 25\u20135 overall, and ranked No. 7 in the country. Following the conclusion of the regular season, Kalin Lucas was named Big Ten Player of the Year and Tom Izzo was voted Big Ten Coach of the Year. As the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, the Spartans defeated Minnesota. However, Michigan State's hopes for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament likely vanished as they were defeated by Ohio State, 82\u201370. Michigan State received an at-large bid as the No. 2 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament, their 12th straight appearance in the Tournament. With wins over Robert Morris and USC, the Spartans were able to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, the school's eighth trip to the Sweet Sixteen in the previous 12 years. MSU advanced to the Elite Eight with a win over No. 14-ranked and No. 3-seeded Kansas. In the Elite Eight, the Spartans defeated Louisville to advance to Final Four in nearby Detroit, only 90 miles from MSU's campus. The Spartans defeated UConn in the national semifinals to earn their third-ever trip to the national championship game. With Izzo 1\u20130 in championship games and the Spartans 2\u20130 all-time, North Carolina scored more points than any team had ever scored in the first half of an NCAA championship game, scoring 55 and blowing out the Spartans 89\u201372, marking the Spartans first ever loss in the national championship game.\nIn 2010, the Spartans finished the non-conference schedule at 10\u20133. The Spartans began the Big Ten season on fire, winning their first nine games and went on to earn a share of the Big Ten championship with a 14\u20134 and ranked 11th in the country. As the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they were defeated in overtime by No. 6 seed Minnesota in the quarterfinals. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, their 13th straight appearance, earning a No. 5 seed in the Midwest Region. A win over New Mexico State and Maryland led MSU to the Sweet Sixteen for the ninth time in 13 years. However, Kalin Lucas suffered a serious knee injury and would miss the remainder of the Tournament. MSU did not seem to miss him and would go on to beat Northern Iowa and Tennessee to advance to their second consecutive Final Four and sixth in the prior 12 years. In the National semifinal, they were defeated by Butler by two points.\nThe 2010\u201311 Spartans. let by senior Kalin Lucas, finished the non-conference portion of their season 8\u20134 and ranked No. 20 in the country. However, the Spartans were inconsistent in conference play, suffering nine losses and finishing 9\u20139 in conference and in danger of missing the NCAA tournament. After beating Iowa and blowing out No. 9 Purdue in the Big Ten tournament, the Spartans fell to Penn State in the semifinals. The blowout win over Purdue likely ensured the Spartans inclusion in the NCAA tournament. Michigan State received a No. 10 seed in the Southeast Region of the NCAA tournament, their 14th straight appearance, but the lowest seeding the Spartans had received in the NCAA tournament since 2002. MSU fell behind early to UCLA in the second round (formerly known as the first round) and made a furious rally, but fell short, losing by two points. The loss marked only the fourth time MSU failed to win a game in their 14 trips to the NCAA tournament under Tom Izzo.\nThe 2011\u201312 Spartans, led by senior Draymond Green, started the season 0\u20132. However, MSU won the next 15 games in a row to jump into the top ten in the polls. A loss in the regular season finale at home to No. 10 Ohio State meant the Spartans shared the Big Ten regular season championship with Ohio State and Michigan, all of which finished the Big Ten season with a 13\u20135 conference record. In that loss to Ohio State, key freshman reserve, Branden Dawson, tore his ACL, ending his season. As the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten tournament, The Spartans beat Iowa, No. 14 Wisconsin, and No. 7 Ohio State to win the tournament championship, their first tournament championship since 2000. Draymond Green earned Big Ten Player of the Year honors, the fifth time a player had done so under Tom Izzo. Izzo was also named Big Ten Coach of the Year. MSU received a No. 1 seed in the West Region of the NCAA tournament, where they beat LIU\u2013Brooklyn in the first round behind Green's triple-double. The Spartans overcame Saint Louis in the second round to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. This marked the 10th time in 15 seasons that the Spartans advanced to at least the Sweet Sixteen. The Spartans, missing Dawson and struggling offensively, became the first No. 1 seed to lose in the Tournament, falling to No. 17 and No. 4-seeded Louisville.\nMSU began the 2012\u201313 season 11\u20132 and ranked No. 18 in the country with wins over No. 7 Kansas and Texas and were led by junior Keith Appling and freshman Gary Harris. The Spartans remained ranked the entire year while finishing tied for second in the Big Ten with Ohio State, with a 13\u20135 conference record and ranked No. 10 in the country. As the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they beat Iowa in the quarterfinals, but fell to eventual tournament champion, Ohio State, in the semifinals. The Spartans received a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament, their 16th straight appearance in the tournament. MSU defeated Valparaiso and Memphis to advance to their fifth Sweet Sixteen in six years and their 11th trip in 16 years. However, the Spartans were defeated by Duke, who was led by Seth Curry, in the Sweet Sixteen.\nMichigan State began the 2013\u201314 season looking to continue Tom Izzo's Final Four streak: every player who had played four years for Izzo had made at least one Final Four. After beating No. 1 Kentucky in the Champions Classic, the Spartans moved to the No. 1 spot in the country. The Spartans held the No. 1 spot for three weeks before losing to North Carolina in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. The Spartans cruised through the remaining non-conference schedule, finishing 11\u20131, to begin the Big Ten season ranked No. 5 in the country. The Spartans won their first seven conference games, but due to injuries to Keith Appling, Adriean Payne, and Brendan Dawson, MSU lost five of their last eight conference games to finish in a second-place tie with Wisconsin at 12\u20136. The Spartans, finally healthy and at full strength, beat Northwestern, No. 12 Wisconsin, and No. 8 Michigan to capture the Big Ten tournament championship. This marked Michigan State's fourth tournament championship. Michigan State earned a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament's East Region. With wins against Delaware and Harvard, they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the third straight year and the 12th time in 17 years. They defeated No. 1-seeded Virginia in the Sweet Sixteen to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2010. There they fell to No. 7 seed and eventual National Champion, Connecticut. With the loss, the Tom Izzo's Final Four streak ended. Shortly after the season, Gary Harris declared for the NBA draft.\nIn 2015, MSU started the season well, but with a shocking loss to Texas Southern at home in overtime, finished the non-conference season at 9\u20134  MSU rallied late in the Big Ten season, winning six of their last eight conference games. MSU finished the season in a tie for third place in conference and got hot in the Big Ten tournament beating Ohio State and No. 8 Maryland, before losing to No. 6 Wisconsin for the tournament title. The Spartans received an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament as a No. 7 seed in the East Region. The bid was MSU's 18th straight trip to the NCAA tournament. MSU beat Georgia in the second round and surprised No. 2-seeded and No. 6-ranked Virginia in the Third Round. With the win, the Spartans advanced to their fourth straight Sweet Sixteen and seventh Sweet Sixteen in eight years. Wins over Oklahoma and Louisville in overtime gave MSU a trip to their seventh Final Four under Tom Izzo. In the Final Four, the Spartans fell to the eventual National Champions for the second straight season, losing a rematch of their Champions Classic game to Duke in the National semifinal.\nWith senior Denzel Valentine leading the 2015\u201316 Spartans, MSU went undefeated in the non-conference with the school's best start in history and moved to No. 1 in the polls. However, Valentine suffered a knee injury in late December and would miss four games as MSU lost its first game of the season in Big Ten play and fell from the top spot in the polls. Upon Valentine's return, MSU continued to struggle, losing four of their first seven conference games and marking their worst conference start since 2003. The Spartans recovered well, losing only one more conference game and finished 13\u20135 in conference, good enough for second place in the Big Ten. MSU's 26 regular season wins tied the most for a Michigan State team in the regular season. Following the regular season, USA Today named Valentine National Player of the Year. The Big Ten also announced that Valentine was the Big Ten's Player of the Year. As the No. 2 seed in the Big Ten tournament, MSU defeated Ohio State for a third time on the season before dispatching Maryland and Purdue to win the tournament championship. With the win, MSU set the record for most Big Ten tournament championships with five (Ohio State has also won five, but one has been vacated due to NCAA violations). MSU, ranked No. 2 in the country, learned that it would not receive a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, instead receiving a No. 2 seed in the Midwest bracket. This marked the 19th consecutive year the Spartans made the NCAA tournament. Despite receiving the No. 2 seed, MSU was considered by some the favorite to with the NCAA Championship. However, MSU was shocked by No. 15-seeded Middle Tennessee in the first round in what some argued was the biggest upset in NCAA tournament history at the time.\nThe 2016\u201317 Spartans were decimated by departures from the prior year as seniors Denzel Valentine, Bryn Forbes, and Matt Costello all graduated and moved to the NBA. Freshman Deyonta Davis also declared his eligibility for the NBA after the year and sophomores Javon Bess and Marvin Clark transferred out of the program. In all, five of the Spartans' top six scorers from the 2016 team did not return. In response, MSU welcomed their most-heralded recruiting class ever as four top-50 ranked players entered the program: Miles Bridges, Joshua Langford, Cassius Winston, and Nick Ward. A young team would look to graduate transfer Ben Carter and seniors Gavin Schilling and Eron Harris to fill the holes left by departing players. However, Carter and Schilling suffered season-ending knee injuries before the season began and Harris would suffer one late in the season. As a result, MSU struggled up front as Ward at 6' 8\" was the tallest on the team. Former walk-on Kenny Goins became the backup big man at 6' 6\". Following losses in their first two games to top-10 teams, MSU suffered two other losses to top-20 teams. Bridges missed seven games with a knee injury near the end of the non-conference slate and the Spartans, who started the season ranked as high as 10 in some polls, entered Big Ten play with an 8\u20135 record. Izzo would lament his early-season schedule which involved trips to Hawaii, New York, and the Bahamas when his young team wouldn't get needed practice time. Wins to start conference play over Minnesota (twice) and Northwestern, which would prove to be two of their better wins on the season, and Bridges's return had MSU at 4\u20131 in conference play. However, inconsistency haunted the Spartans as their failure to win road games left the Spartans at 8\u20135 in conference play with a visit to conference leaders, Purdue. MSU was handled easily by the Boilermakers and Harris suffered his knee injury which appeared to spell the end of MSU's 19-year NCAA tournament streak. However, Bridges, who averaged over 16 points and eight rebounds on the season, and Ward who averaged over 13 points and six rebounds, led the Spartans as they knocked off No. 16-ranked Wisconsin to likely seal a trip to the NCAA tournament. A 10\u20138 conference record left the Spartans in a tie for fifth place. A win over Penn State in the Big Ten tournament preceded a loss to Minnesota, but was enough for the Spartans to get an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament for the 20th consecutive year. As a No. 9 seed, a win over Miami in the first round led to a loss to No. 1-seeded Kansas and an end to the season. Bridges finished the season with perhaps the second-best freshman season in MSU history (behind Magic Johnson): 16.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.5 blocks per game.\nSurprisingly, Bridges opted to not enter the NBA draft and returned to Michigan State for his sophomore year in 2017\u201318. With newcomer Jaren Jackson Jr., a consensus top-25 player, joining the team, the Spartans were picked by several publications as the No. 1 team in the country. They began the season ranked No. 2 behind Duke. After a loss to Duke in the second game of the season, the Spartans won the Victory Bracket of the PK\u201380 Tournament holding No. 9-ranked North Carolina to a school-record low for shooting percentage as they shot 24.6% from the field, including 5.6% from three-point land. The Spartans won 14 straight games, and ascended to No. 1 in the country. A road loss to surprise Big Ten contender Ohio State followed by a home loss to rival Michigan dropped MSU in the rankings and shook the team's confidence. However, the team rebounded well, finishing the season by winning their last 12 regular season games, including a win over Big Ten co-leader Purdue as Bridges took the ball and hit a three-pointer to win the game. On February 17, 2018 while playing at Northwestern, the Spartans overcame a 27-point deficit to beat the Wildcats, at that time, the fifth largest comeback all-time in Division I history. The Spartans finished with a school-record 16 Big Ten wins and their first outright regular season Big Ten title since 2009. The team also finished 28\u20133, a record for regular season wins. The Spartans fell again to their rival Michigan in the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament and received only a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament due to their low strength of schedule. The NCAA trip marked the school's 21st consecutive trip to the Tournament, but following a win in the first round over Bucknell, the Spartans fell to 11th-seeded Syracuse marking the third consecutive year and first time under Izzo that the Spartans had failed to reach the Sweet Sixteen in a three-year period. The Spartans led the nation in field goal defense, rebounding margin, and blocks. Freshman Jaren Jackson Jr. set the single-season MSU record for blocks and was named the Big Ten Freshman of the Year. Bridges was named first-team All-Big Ten and second team All-American. For much of the season, the on-court play was shrouded by reports that surfaced that Tom Izzo's program had covered up sexual assault allegations ten years prior. Izzo refused to comment on the reports due to an ongoing investigation by several agencies including Michigan Attorney General's office  and the United States Department of Education, but repeatedly said he had no intention of leaving Michigan State and that he had cooperated with all investigations including the previous allegation of sexual assault in 2010. In August 2018 the NCAA cleared Izzo in his handling of the sexual assault allegations. The school was implicated tangentially to the FBI-college basketball scandal as reports surfaced that Bridges had been paid to attend Michigan State, among other allegations. MSU conducted an investigation and presented their findings that the allegations were false to the NCAA, who cleared Bridges, ruling him eligible to play.\nFollowing Bridges and Jackson's departures to the NBA, the 2018\u201319 team began the season ranked No. 10 in the country. The season was dominated by injuries to the Spartans. Starting guard Joshua Langford only played 13 games before missing the rest of the season with a foot injury. Key starter Matt McQuaid missed three games with injury and key reserve Kyle Ahrens missed nine games with back and ankle injuries. With five games remaining in the Big Ten regular season, big man Nick Ward suffered a hairline fracture in his shooting hand and missed the rest of the regular season. He returned in time for the postseason, but was not the same as he struggled to return to the lineup. Despite this, the Spartans earned a share of the Big Ten regular season championship with Purdue and defeated arch-rival Michigan twice in the regular season. Led by Big Ten Player of the Year and consensus second team All-American Cassius Winston, the Spartans also won the Big Ten tournament for the sixth time, again defeating Michigan in the championship game to go 3\u20130 against their rival. As the No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, the school's 22nd straight appearance in the Tournament, the Spartans defeated Bradley and Minnesota to advance to their first Sweet Sixteen in four years. In the Sweet Sixteen, the Spartans blew out No. 3 seed LSU to face top-seeded Duke in the Elite Eight. Despite having multiple first round NBA Draft picks, the Spartans knocked off the Blue Devils to earn a trip to the school's 10th Final Four and eighth under Izzo. The win over Duke improved Izzo's record to 2\u201311 against Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. In the Final Four, the Spartans were upset by Texas Tech, ending the school's bid for a third national championship. Winston led the Spartans, averaging 18.8 points and 7.5 assists per game.\nThe 2020 team started the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll for the first time in school history. Senior point guard Cassius Winston was a popular pick as the preseason player of the year. However, shortly before the season, it was announced that Josh Langford had reinjured the foot that had caused him to miss most of the prior season. Langford would not play a game for the Spartans during the season. Due in part to Langford's injury, the Spartans struggled in the non-conference schedule, losing the first game of the season to No. 2 Kentucky before losing twice more in their first eight games and falling to 5\u20133. MSU also struggled as Cassius Winston dealt with the suicide of his brother, Zachary, on November 10, 2020. Winston did not miss a game due to the tragedy, but did struggle for a portion of the season. MSU rebounded as Winston struggled to return to his All-American form and the Spartans did not lose again until Big Ten play after starting the conference schedule 5\u20130. The Spartans then lost six of their next 10 games to all but assure they would be unable to win their third straight Big Ten regular season championship. The Spartans rebounded to win their final five games and come from a three-game deficit to earn a share of their third straight Big Ten championship. As the Spartans prepared for the postseason, they were once again a popular pick to win the NCAA tournament. However, the season ended abruptly when all postseason tournaments, including the NCAA tournament, were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cassius Winston finished his MSU career with the most assists in Big Ten history and was a consensus second team All-American for the second consecutive year.\nIn the COVID-19-shortened 2020\u201321 season, MSU began the season well, beating Duke at the Champions Classic for only the third time under Izzo. MSU finished the shortened non-conference schedule with a perfect 6\u20130 record and ranked No. 4 in the country. However, things changed abruptly when MSU began Big Ten play. The Spartans lost four of their first six games before pausing team activities for about two weeks due to positive COVID-19 tests in the program. Upon returning to play, MSU lost three straight dropping their conference record to 2\u20137 on the season and making it seem highly unlikely that they would continue the school's NCAA tournament appearance streak. Four games later, their odds had not improved as they sat at 4\u20139 in conference and 10\u20139 overall with seven games remaining. MSU, however, did the unthinkable: five of their last seven games including wins over No. 5 Illinois, No. 4 Ohio State, and No. 2 Michigan to finish the regular season with 15\u201311 overall record. At 9\u201311 in the Big Ten, MSU finished with a losing record for the first time under Izzo, but looked safe to move the NCAA tournament streak to 23 straight appearances. A loss in the second round of the Big Ten tournament marked the first time ever that the Spartans would not compete in the quarterfinals and left them on shaky ground for the NCAA tournament. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 11 seed in the South region. For the first time, MSU was forced to participate in the First Four, losing to UCLA in overtime.\nLooking to rebound from one of the worst seasons in Izzo's tenure, the Spartans began the 2021\u201322 season with a loss to No. 3 Kansas. Following the loss, they won five straight before losing to defending national champion Baylor. They would not lose again until suffering a home loss to Northwestern ended their perfect start to conference play leaving them at 14\u2013, 5\u20131 on the season. They rebounded well in the next game, winning on the road against No. 8 Wisconsin, but would lose six of their next nine games to drop to 9\u20137 in Big Ten play and falling out of the national polls. A win over No. 4 Purdue restored likely ensured a trip to the NCAA tournament, but the Spartans dropped two of their last three regular season games, finishing 11\u20139 in Big Ten play and finishing in a tie with Michigan for seventh in the conference. They beat Maryland in the second round of the Big Ten tournament before beating Wisconsin in the quarterfinals. However, their Big Ten tournament run ended in the semifinals with a loss to Purdue. The Spartans continued their streak of NCAA tournament appearances, extending it to 24 straight seasons as they received an at-large bid as the No. 7 seed in the West region. In the first round, they eked out a 74\u201373 win against Davidson, featuring former MSU player Foster Loyer. In the second round of the tournament, they faced Duke in what would be the final match-up between Mike Krzyzewski and Tom Izzo due to Krzyzewski's retirement after the season. MSU kept the game close and held a 70\u201365 with five minutes remaining before Duke outscored them 20\u20136 to end the game and eliminate the Spartans from the tournament.\nThe 2022\u201323 team played their second game of the season on the USS Abraham Lincoln against No. 2-ranked Gonzaga, but lost by a point. A win over Kentucky in the Champions Classic highlighted the early season. However, MSU was blown out by Alabama and Notre Dame early in the season and lost their first conference game to Northwestern. MSU recovered well, starting conference play 4\u20131 (12\u20134 overall) before losing five of their next seven games. A game scheduled to be played on campus on February 15 was canceled due to a shooting on campus the day before that killed four students. The Spartans finished the regular season 19\u201311, 11\u20138 in conference play to finish in fourth place. A loss in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament preceded the team's 25th consecutive selection to the NCAA tournament. As the No. 7 seed in the East region, the Spartans defeated USC and upset No. 2-seeded Marquette to earn the school's first Sweet Sixteen appearance since 2019. In a very entertaining game, the Spartans lost to Kansas State to finish their season.\nLooking to improve on the previous year's Sweet Sixteen appearance, the Spartans returned all major contributors to the team except Joey Hauser. The Spartans began the 2023\u201324 season ranked No. 4 in both preseason polls. However, they started the season 1\u20132 including a loss in the season opener to James Madison. Another loss to No. 3-ranked Arizona and losses to Wisconsin and Nebraska in the early schedule left them at 4\u20135. They blew out No. 6-ranked Baylor in Detroit. However, the Spartans started the Big Ten season 1\u20134 before recovering to move to 9\u20136 in conference by the middle of February. With a win over Michigan on January 30, 2024, his 69th birthday, Tom Izzo earned his 700th career win, all at MSU. However, they lost four of their last five conference game to finish with a 10\u201310 conference record in a three-way tie for sixth place. As the No. 8 seed in the Big Ten tournament, MSU defeated Minnesota in the second round before losing to top-seeded Purdue in the quarterfinals. The Spartans received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament as the No. 9 seed in the West region, extending Izzo's record-setting streak to 26 straight tournament appearances. They easily defeated Mississippi State in the first round before losing to No. 1-seeded North Carolina to finish the season a disappointing 20\u201315. The Spartans bounced back from the 2nd round loss the previous year in the NCAA Tournament and finished the 2024\u201325 season 30\u20137, 17\u20133 in Big Ten play to win the regular season championship by three games and finished in the top 10 in the nation in the national polls after starting the season unranked. They defeated Oregon in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament before losing to Wisconsin. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 2 seed in the South region for the 27th consecutive tournament, the nation's longest active streak.[1] They defeated Bryant 87-62 in the first round[2] and New Mexico 71-63 in the second round to advance to the Sweet Sixteen.[3] It marked the 16th Sweet Sixteen appearance under Izzo and the school's 22nd overall.[4] MSU defeated Ole Miss 73-70 to advance to the Elite Eight[5] where they lost to overall No. 1 seed Auburn 70-64.[6]\n\nCoaches\nThree Michigan State coaches have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. They are Pete Newell (National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, Class of 2006), Jud Heathcote (National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, Class of 2009), and Tom Izzo (Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Class of 2016). Since 1976, the Spartans have had only two head basketball coaches, Heathcote and Izzo. Heathcote (1976\u20131995) coached the Spartans for 19 seasons before retiring following the 1994\u201395 season. His hand-picked successor, Izzo, an assistant with MSU since 1983, completed his 25th year as head coach of the Spartans in 2020.\nOn November 28, 2009, Izzo passed Heathcote's mark of 340 career wins by beating UMass 106\u201368. Izzo now leads all MSU basketball coaches in wins with 628 through 2020. On March 6, 2022, Izzo surpassed Bob Knight for the most wins by a men's basketball coach at a Big Ten school with 663.\nOf all MSU coaches who have headed the Spartans basketball squad in at least a dozen games, Izzo is second in winning percentage and no MSU coach tops him since 1910. Former coach George E. Denman won all 11 games he coached between 1901 and 1903 and Chester L. Brewer won 70 of 95 games from 1903 to 1910. \n\nThrough April 1, 2025\n\nJud Heathcote\nJud Heathcote won three Big Ten titles in his 19 years at MSU. His teams appeared in nine NCAA tournaments, four Sweet Sixteens, one Elite Eight, one Final Four and won one National Championship. After his early success with Magic Johnson and company, Heathcote finished his career strong, appearing in five NCAA tournaments in his final six years. However, he never advanced past the Sweet Sixteen after winning the championship in 1979. His teams also appeared in three NITs reaching the NIT Final Four in 1989.\nHeathcote was named Big Ten Coach of the Year in 1978 and 1986. Heathcote was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, Class of 2009.\nTom Izzo worked as an assistant under Heathcote for 12 years prior to being named his successor. Other assistants who worked under Heathcote went on to head coaching positions: Don Monson (Idaho and Oregon), Bill Berry (San Jose State), Mike Deane (Siena, Marquette, Lamar, and Wagner), Jim Boylan (Chicago Bulls and Milwaukee Bucks), Jim Boylen (Utah), Stan Joplin (Toledo), and Brian Gregory (Dayton, Georgia Tech, and South Florida).\nRecord by season under Heathcote:\nSee Michigan State Spartans men's basketball seasons\n\nTom Izzo\nSince 1995, the team has been coached by Tom Izzo, who has an overall record of 727\u2013300 (through February 17, 2025) as the head coach at Michigan State. Izzo coached the Spartans to their second national championship in 2000 with an 89\u201376 victory over Florida. Izzo has turned Michigan State into a perennial basketball powerhouse.\nOn March 15, 2019, Izzo won his 600th game. On March 8, 2022, Izzo surpassed Bob Knight for the most wins by a men's basketball coach at a Big Ten school with 663. On January 30, 2024, also his 69th birthday, Izzo won his 700th game by beating rival Michigan 81\u201362. Izzo set the record for most conference wins on February 15, 2025 with 354.\nIzzo was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014.\nIzzo has guided the Spartans to eight NCAA Final Fours since 1999, an accomplishment unmatched by any other college basketball program during that span. Izzo has never had a losing season at MSU and has also appeared in a postseason tournament every year he has headed the MSU basketball program: two years in the National Invitation Tournament and 27 straight appearances in the NCAA tournament. His teams have won 11 Big Ten regular season championships, six Big Ten tournament championships and have reached the Sweet Sixteen 20 times, the Elite Eight 14 times, the Final Four eight times, and played in two NCAA Championship games. His 2000 team won the NCAA National Championship.\nIzzo has received numerous awards including the 1998 Associated Press National Coach of the Year, the 1998 Basketball News National Coach of the Year, the 1998 United States Basketball Writers Association Henry Iba Coach of the Year Award (1998), three-time Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year (1998, 2009, 2012), the 1998 Basketball Times Mideast Coach of the Year, the 1999 Basketball News Coach of the Year Award, two-time National Association of Basketball Coaches Coach of the Year Award (2001, 2012) and the 2005 Clair Bee Award.\nNumerous assistant coaches under Izzo have gone to be head coaches at other schools. Tom Crean, the former head coach at Georgia, was head coach at Indiana and Marquette for nine years each. Brian Gregory coached for Dayton, Georgia Tech and South Florida. Former assistant coach Mike Garland spent three seasons as head coach at Cleveland State following an initial seven-year stint as an assistant at MSU. Former assistant Stan Heath was head coach at Kent State, Arkansas, and South Florida. Current associate head coach Doug Wojcik was the head coach at Tulsa and College of Charleston. Longtime assistant Dwayne Stephens was named head coach at Western Michigan in 2022. Mark Montgomery was the head coach at Northern Illinois from 2011 to 2021 and was named head coach of Detroit Mercy in 2024. Several former assistants, including Garland, Montgomery, and Wojcik have returned to assistant roles under Izzo after being fired from head coaching positions.\n\nSeason by season results\nUnder Tom Izzo:\n\nPostseason history\nNCAA tournament\nThe Spartans have appeared in 38 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournaments, with a current streak of 27 straight years, with two NCAA basketball national championships.

Nike, Inc. started making jerseys for the team at the start of the 2000\u201301 season.\nThe current home jersey, introduced as part of a rebranding effort by the athletic department in April 2010, is white with green uniform numbers and a green custom font \"SPARTANS\" across the chest. The road jersey is green with white uniform numbers and a white custom font \"SPARTANS\" across the chest. The Spartans do not currently wear an official alternate uniform but the team has worn a silver alternate, a 1979 throwback, a 2000 throwback, and a MAC (Michigan Agricultural College) uniform in the past. The team also wore specially made camouflage jerseys for the 2011 Carrier Classic, played on a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier against North Carolina. Beginning in the 2014\u201315 season, the Spartans frequently wore their 1979 throwback jerseys as their home uniform. On January 23, 2016, MSU wore specially designed \"Mean Green\" uniforms. During the 2016\u201317 season, the Spartans frequently wore the MAC throwback uniforms at home.\n\nFacilities\nThe Spartans used the College Gymnasium prior to moving to Demonstration Hall for 10 years.\n\nDemonstration Hall\nThe Spartans used this building, still in use on campus today, as their home from 1930 to the opening of Jenison Fieldhouse in 1940.\n\nJenison Fieldhouse\nThe arena opened in 1940 and was named for alumnus Frederick Cowles Jenison, whose estate, along with PWAP funds, funded the building. The building was the home of the Spartans from 1940 to 1989 when the Breslin Center opened.\nThe venue is most famous for its 1979 NCAA champion basketball team, which included Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, and was coached by Jud Heathcote.\nJenison also hosted the 1963 NCAA tournament's Mideast Regionals. A plaque outside the arena commemorates one of the 1963 regional semifinals; the \"Game of Change,\" in which a segregated Mississippi State team played and lost to the eventual national champion, an integrated Loyola team. The losing Maroons (now known as the Bulldogs) had defied a court order prohibiting them from leaving the state to play an integrated team. The game is now seen as a watershed moment in the intersection of civil rights and sports during the Civil Rights Movement.\nThe building is still in use on campus today.\n\nBreslin Center\nThe Spartans play home games at the Jack Breslin Student Events Center on campus. The arena is commonly referred to as \"Breslin\" and \"the Bres\", and was opened in 1989. It is named for Jacweir \"Jack\" Breslin, an MSU alumnus, former athlete and administrator, who first began pushing for the arena in 1969. Its capacity is 14,797 seats, and the stadium superseded Jenison Fieldhouse.\nThe arena's current basketball court is the same floor where the Spartans won the 2000 NCAA tournament, which was at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. The school purchased the floor from the NCAA and Final Four floor installer Horner Flooring after the title game. A plaque was installed on the baseline near the Michigan State tunnel to commemorate the floor's role in the school's history.\nThe Breslin Center is home to the Izzone, a large student section named after Coach Izzo, the basketball team's head coach since 1995. The student section had been named Spartan Spirits and Jud's Jungle prior to Izzo's prominence at the school. The Izzone routinely gets mentioned in discussions of the nation's top student fan sections, and in 2006 was ranked as the 4th-best in the country. The section helped cheer the Spartans to a 53-game home win streak between 1998 and 2002 and also a 28-game winning streak from 2007 and 2009.\nThe arena underwent a $50 million renovation to improve the visitor experience and to create a Michigan State University Basketball Hall of History.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",
    "summary": "The Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Michigan State University. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference of NCAA Division I college basketball. The Spartans have won two NCAA National championships,  17 Big Ten Regular Season Championships, and 6 Big Ten Tournament Championships. Their home games are played at the Jack Breslin Student Events Center (\"Breslin Center\") in East Lansing, Michigan. Tom Izzo has been the head coach since 1995. \nTheir two national championships came in the 1979 NCAA tournament and the 2000 NCAA tournament. The 1979 national championship game was the most watched college basketball game in history, with 35.11 million television viewers.

The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and play their home games at Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Wolverines have won one NCAA Championship, three National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), 15 Big Ten regular season titles and four Big Ten tournaments. One NIT title and one Big Ten tournament were later vacated by the NCAA due to sanctions. \nMichigan has had 35 All-Americans, selected 48 times. Eight of these have been consensus All-Americans, which are Cazzie Russell (twice), Rickey Green, Gary Grant, Chris Webber, Trey Burke, as well as Harry Kipke, Richard Doyle and Bennie Oosterbaan (twice) who were retroactively selected by the Helms Foundation. Twelve All-Americans have been at least two-time honorees. Russell was the only three-time All-American.\nSeventy-seven players have been drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA); thirty-two of those were first round draft picks, including both Cazzie Russell and Chris Webber who were selected first overall. The 1990 NBA draft, in which Rumeal Robinson was selected 10th, Loy Vaught was selected 13th, and Terry Mills was selected 16th made Michigan the third of only ten schools that have ever had three or more players selected in the first round of the same draft. Six players have gone on to become NBA champions for a total of nine times and eight players have become NBA All-Stars a total of 18 times. Rudy Tomjanovich coached both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals champions. Glen Rice is one of only thirteen basketball players to have won a high school state championship, NCAA title and NBA championship.\nDuring the 1990s Michigan endured an NCAA violations scandal, described as involving one of the largest amounts of illicit money in NCAA history, when Ed Martin loaned four players a reported total of $616,000. Due to sanctions, records starting in the 1992 Final Four, the 1992\u201393 season, and the 1995\u201396 season through the 1998\u201399 season were vacated by the NCAA. Throughout this article asterisks denote awards, records and honors that have been vacated.\n\nBy the numbers\nAll-time wins \u2013 1,732\nAll-time winning percentage \u2013 .606*\nNCAA National Championships \u2013 1\nNCAA Final Fours \u2013 8*\nNCAA Elite Eights \u2013 15*\nNCAA Sweet Sixteens \u2013 19*\nNCAA tournament appearances \u2013 32*\nNCAA tournament wins \u2013 68*\nNo. 1 seeds in NCAA tournament \u2013 3*\nConference regular season championships \u2013 15\nConference tournament championships \u2013 4*\n30+ win seasons \u2013 5*\n20+ win seasons \u2013 31*\nWeeks ranked No. 1 in AP poll \u2013 22\n* Includes vacated results and accomplishments\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1908\u201319)\nAs a result of public and alumni demand for a basketball team, Michigan fielded a team of members of the then-current student body and achieved a 1\u20134 record for the 1908\u201309 season. However, after three years of demanding a basketball program, the student body did not attend the games and the program was terminated due to low attendance. Basketball returned in 1917 in what was considered the inaugural season of varsity basketball. The team was coached by Elmer Mitchell who instituted the intramural sports program at Michigan. The team finished 6\u201312 overall (0\u201310, Big Ten). The following year Mitchell led the team to a 16\u20138 (5\u20135) record.\n\nMather era (1919\u201328)\nE. J. Mather coached the team to three Big Ten titles in his nine seasons as coach. After inheriting Mitchell's team, which he led to a 10\u201313 overall (3\u20139, Big Ten) record during the 1919\u201320 season, he led the team to an 18\u20134 overall (8\u20134, Big Ten) record during the 1920\u201321 season. This 1921 team won its first eight and last eight games to tie the Wisconsin Badgers and Purdue Boilermakers for the Big Ten title. The team won back-to-back championships in 1925\u201326 and 1926\u201327. The 1926 squad, which was captained by Richard Doyle who became the team's first All-American, tied with Purdue, the Iowa Hawkeyes and Indiana Hoosiers for the conference championship. The 1927 team had a new All-American, Bennie Oosterbaan, and won the school's first back-to-back championships and first outright championship with a 14\u20133 overall (10\u20132, Big Ten) record. Mather died after a lengthy battle with cancer in August 1928.\n\nVeenker era (1928\u201331)\nGeorge F. Veenker compiled the highest overall and highest Big Ten winning percentages of any coach in school history during his three years as coach. He earned 1st(tied), 3rd and 2nd(tied) finishes during his three seasons, which included the 1928\u201329 conference championship. During Veenker's first season his team compiled a 13\u20133 overall (10\u20132, Big Ten) record to win the conference, and Veenker continues to be the only coach in school history to win a conference championship in his first season. The championship team, which finished tied with Wisconsin, was captained by the school's third All-American Ernie McCoy. Veenker resigned to become the Iowa State Cyclones football head coach.\n\nCappon era (1931\u201338)\nFranklin Cappon had a long history of association with Michigan athletics starting with his service as a four-time letterman in football and basketball from 1919 to 1923. In 1928, he became assistant football and basketball coach and in 1929 he served as Fielding H. Yost's assistant Athletic Director. Although the highlight of Cappon's tenure as coach was a 16\u20134 (9\u20133) third place 1936\u201337 Big Ten finish, he coached John Townsend who in his 1937\u201338 senior season became last All-American for at least 10 years. The team finished third in two other seasons with less impressive records of 10\u20138 overall (8\u20134, Big Ten) in 1932\u201333 and 15\u20135 overall (7\u20135, Big Ten) 1935\u201336, and Cappon's overall record was 78\u201357 overall (44\u201340, Big Ten). A notable captain during the Cappon era was 1933\u201334 captain Ted Petoskey, a two-time football All-American end and eventual Major League Baseball player.\n\nOosterbaan era (1938\u201346)\nIn 1938 Michigan coaching duties were assumed by one of its greatest athletes. Bennie Oosterbaan had been an All-American in both football and basketball and held various coaching positions at Michigan in both of those sports as well as baseball. In basketball, he implemented a fast-paced attack as coach, and his teams' best overall record was 13\u20137 in 1939\u201340. That season he tied with his final season for his best Big Ten record at 6\u20136. He resigned after eight seasons to concentrate on his football coaching duties.\n\nCowles era (1946\u201348)\nUnder Ozzie Cowles, during the 1947\u201348 season, Michigan ended the longest (19 years) consecutive year period without a conference championship in school history. They also became the first contestants in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament during Cowles second of two seasons. The 1947\u201348 team posted a 16\u20136 overall (10\u20132, Big Ten) record. This team also posted the first undefeated home performance in school history with a 9\u20130 overall (6\u20130, Big Ten) record.\n\nMcCoy era (1948\u201352)\nErnie McCoy became the second former All-American Wolverine player to coach the team. Like Oosterbaan before him, he became a football and baseball coach at Michigan. He also served as assistant Athletic Director under Fritz Crisler. During his four seasons as basketball coach, Michigan's best finish was during the 1948\u201349 season when they finished 15\u20136 overall (7\u20135, Big Ten) and earned a third place Big Ten Conference finish. He coached Michigan's first All-Big Ten basketball players that season in Pete Elliot and captain Bob Harrison who were both selected to the first team. Harrison returned the following season as the first repeat first-team All-Big Ten basketball player and Elliot was a second-team honoree. McCoy served as a football scout at the same time.\n\nPerigo era (1952\u201360)\nBill Perigo took over the Michigan coaching job after having served three seasons as Western Michigan basketball coach. Despite previous success as a conference basketball champion coach at Western and subsequent success as a Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) champion basketball coach, his Michigan teams endured several mediocre seasons. His best Big Ten records came in 1956\u201357 and 1958\u201359 when his teams compiled 8\u20136 conference records. The latter team was tied for second in the conference and was 15\u20137 overall (8\u20136, Big Ten). It also had Perigo's only first-team All-Big Ten athlete in M. C. Burton. Team captain and two-time football consensus All-American Ron Kramer was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956.\n\nStrack era (1960\u201368)\nDave Strack, a former team 1945\u201346 captain, had become the freshman basketball team coach in 1948 and later had become a variety assistant to Perigo. He led the team to three consecutive Big Ten Championships from 1963 to 1966 and a third-place finish in the 1964 NCAA tournament. During 1964\u201365 the team compiled a 24\u20134 overall (13\u20131, Big Ten) record while completing an undefeated 11\u20130 overall (7\u20130, Big Ten) home season and was the national runner-up, falling to John Wooden's UCLA in the 1965 championship game. Strack earned United Press International (UPI) National Coach of the Year honors. The team ended the season listed number one in both the UPI and Associated Press (AP) national rankings. He recruited All-Americans Russell and Buntin to anchor his mid-1960s teams. Tomjanovich also became a Wolverine at the end of Strack's career and became second team All-Big Ten in 1968 subsequent later stardom. The 1964 team, which went 23\u20135 overall (11\u20133, Big Ten), tied with Ohio State with sophomore Russell and junior Buntin. In 1965, Buntin became the first Wolverine to be drafted by the NBA. In 1966, Russell led the team to its third straight conference championship and NCAA selection on his way to National Player of the Year honors.\n\nOrr era (1968\u201380)\nIn Johnny Orr's twelve seasons, he twice (1973\u201374 and 1976\u201377) earned Big Ten Coach of the Year honors with Big Ten championships. His teams earned four consecutive NCAA selections from 1974 to 1977. The 25\u20137 overall (14\u20134, Big Ten) 1976 team lost to an undefeated Indiana team in the NCAA championship game and Orr earned National Association of Basketball Coaches Coach of the Year honors that season. The 26\u20134 overall (16\u20132, Big Ten) 1977 team finished first in both the AP and UPI national rankings, and Orr won Basketball Weekly National Coach of the Year honors. During Orr's tenure, six players earned a total of seven All-American recognitions, which is the most of any Michigan coach. Steve Grote became Michigan's only three-time first-team Academic All-American from 1975 to 1977 and with a second team All Big Ten as well as three honorable mentions was the first four-time All-Big Ten honoree.\n\nFrieder era (1980\u201389)\nBill Frieder, who had been an assistant coach for seven years, took over from Orr in 1980. He coached the school's first post-season basketball champions during the 1983\u201384 season and the following two teams were back-to-back conference champions. The 1983\u201384 team compiled a 24\u20139 overall (11\u20137, Big Ten) record on their way to a NIT championship victory over Notre Dame. The 1984\u201385 team went 26\u20134 overall (16\u20132, Big Ten), which earned Frieder Big Ten and AP National Coach of the Year honors. The 1985\u201386 team, which finished 28\u20135 overall (14\u20134, Big Ten), started the season with 16 victories to make a total of 33 consecutive regular season victories. Frieder earned five of Michigan's six consecutive NCAA births from 1985 to 1990, currently the longest streak in program history. Roy Tarpley led the 1985 team as Big Ten MVP. After the 1988\u201389 season, Frieder accepted the head coach's job at Arizona State, but wanted to remain at Michigan for the NCAA tournament. However, when Frieder told athletic director Bo Schembechler of his intentions, Schembechler ordered him to leave immediately, telling him, \"I don't want someone from Arizona State coaching the Michigan team. A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan.\"\n\nFisher era (1989\u201397)\nFrieder's top assistant, Steve Fisher, was named interim coach immediately before the 1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and led the team to six straight victories and the championship. Following the victory, Michigan dropped the \"interim\" tag from Fisher's title. Two years later, Fisher signed the famous recruiting class known as the Fab Five (Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson). He would take these players to the NCAA championship game as Freshmen and Sophomores.  Fisher also won the 1997 NIT tournament with a team that compiled a 25\u20139 overall (11\u20135) record. Many of Fisher's and the basketball team's accomplishments were tarnished by significant NCAA sanctions. He left the job due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.\n\nEllerbe era (1997\u20132001)\nBrian Ellerbe assumed the title of interim coach less than five months after becoming an assistant coach. He was named full-time coach following the 25\u20139 (11\u20135) 1997\u201398 season in which he led the team to victories over Iowa, Minnesota and Purdue to capture the Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament championship. His subsequent teams never finished better than seventh in the conference.\n\nAmaker era (2001\u201307)\nTommy Amaker inherited a team that imposed sanctions on itself after his first year at the helm of the program. Nonetheless, he coached the team to the postseason three times including both an NIT championship in 2004 and a runner-up finish in 2006. During the 2005\u201306, when the team compiled a 22\u201311 overall (8\u20138, Big Ten) record, he led them to their first national ranking in eight years when they reached No. 20 in the AP poll. Despite his successes, the team never won a Big Ten Championship and never made the NCAA tournament, which led to his firing after six seasons.\n\nBeilein era (2007\u201319)\nJohn Beilein's 10\u201322 overall (5\u201313 Big Ten) in his inaugural season featured the second most losses in Michigan basketball history. The Wolverines improved in Beilein's second season and posted impressive non-conference victories over top-five ranked opponents UCLA and Duke. Beilein led Michigan to the 2009 NCAA tournament, its first appearance since 1998 and the first that was not vacated since 1995. After upsetting Clemson in the first round, the Wolverines were eliminated by Oklahoma in the round of 32 by a final score of 73\u201363.\nFollowing a disappointing 15\u201317 season in 2009\u201310, the Wolverines bounced back to return to the NCAA tournament in 2011, advancing to the round of 32 before losing to top-seeded Duke, 73\u201371. The 2010\u201311 Wolverines, who swept rival Michigan State for the first time since 1997, finished the season 21\u201314. In the 2011\u201312 season, Michigan split the season series between Ohio State and Michigan State, and was the co-Big Ten champions along with the Buckeyes and Spartans. It was the program's first Big Ten title since 1986. The Wolverines finished the season 24\u201310 and 13\u20135 in conference play, losing in the opening round of the 2012 NCAA tournament.\nThe 2012\u201313 Michigan team earned a No. 1 ranking in the AP poll on January 28, 2013, marking the first time since  November 30, 1992 that Michigan held that position. The team also made program history for the best season start, at 21\u20132. On March 31, The Wolverines defeated Florida by a score of 79\u201359 to make their first Final Four appearance since the 1992\u201393 season. The Wolverines then defeated Syracuse by a score of 61\u201356 in the Final Four. In the 2013 NCAA tournament national championship game, the Wolverines lost against Louisville by the score of 82\u201376. On February 20, 2018, NCAA confirmed and upheld penalties against Louisville for \"arranging striptease dances and sex acts for prospects, student-athletes and others.\" Louisville had to vacate its 2013 national championship, but the NCAA does not retroactively award vacated championships to default winners.\nThe 2013\u201314 team had another strong season, winning Michigan's first outright Big Ten championship since 1986 and advancing to the Elite Eight of the 2014 NCAA tournament, where it lost to Kentucky 75\u201372. With the departure of several key players to NBA draft, as well as injuries to Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton, the 2014\u201315 team ended the season with a 16\u201316 record and a quarterfinals appearance at the Big Ten tournament, but did not make the 2015 NCAA tournament. Despite several injuries before and during the season, the 2015\u201316 team compiled a 23\u201313 record and made it to the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament. The team also qualified as a First Four team for the 2016 NCAA tournament, but eventually lost in the round of 64.\nDuring the 2016\u201317 season, Beilein became the winningest coach in school history, passing Johnny Orr with his 210th win on March 9, with a 75\u201355 win over Illinois in the opening round of the 2017 Big Ten tournament. Michigan went on to win the tournament, its first since the vacated 1998 title, winning four games in four days as the No. 8 seed and capping it off with a 71\u201356 championship victory over Wisconsin. It was the first time that a No. 8 seed had won the Big Ten tournament. Michigan made the 2017 NCAA tournament as a No. 7 seed, defeating Oklahoma State and Louisville to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Michigan went on to lose to Oregon in the round and finished the season with a 26-12 record. \nDuring the 2017\u201318 season, Beilein's Wolverines again won four games in four days to win back-to-back Big Ten tournament championships for the first time in school history. The team went on to win the West regional title and advance to the Final Four following its win over Florida State, 58\u201354. The win improved the team's record to 32\u20137, marking a new school record for victories. Following a Final Four victory over a rising Loyola-Chicago team, Michigan moved on to face Villanova in the 2018 NCAA tournament national championship game. The Wolverines fell short by a score of 79\u201362, and this brought Michigan\u2019s record in a national championship game to 1\u20136, the worst record among teams that have previously won a title.\nThe 2018\u201319 team started the season on the best run in program history, winning their first 17 games before losing to Wisconsin on the road. The Wolverines finished the regular season third in the Big Ten and earned a No. 2 seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament, despite losing three starters from the previous season's team. The team made it to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament for a third straight season before losing to No. 3 seed Texas Tech.\nOn May 13, 2019, in a surprising move, Beilein signed a five-year contract to become the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Beilein led Michigan to a 278\u2013150 record with nine NCAA tournament appearances, including two finishes as the national runner-up. Beilein advocated for a system similar to college football, where a committed player needed to stay in school for at least three years. It was speculated that the rise of \"one-and-done\" and early NBA Draft entries, which resulted in a trend of more time spent on recruiting and higher turnover of players, contributed to Beilein\u2019s decision to depart from college basketball. Beilein's departure from Michigan was widely regarded as a loss for college basketball.\n\nHoward era (2019\u20132024)\nOn May 22, 2019, Fab Five member Juwan Howard was named the head basketball coach of the Wolverines, agreeing on a five-year contract. Despite losing three of their leading scorers from the 2018\u201319 team to the NBA draft, Howard led an unranked Wolverines to a 7\u20130 start, including back-to-back wins over No. 6 UNC, 73\u201364, and No. 8 Gonzaga, 82\u201364, capturing the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament title. Following the strong performance, Michigan jumped from unranked to No. 4 in the AP poll, becoming only the second team after the 1989\u201390 Kansas Jayhawks to achieve the feat in the 70-year history of the poll. In their first Big Ten game under Howard, the Wolverines defeated Iowa 103\u201391 and scored their most points in a Big Ten game since 1998 (112 against Indiana). They achieved the No. 9 seed in the 2020 Big Ten tournament, but their first game, against No. 8 seed Rutgers, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn March 4, 2021, the 2020\u201321 Wolverines clinched the regular season Big Ten title with a 69\u201350 victory over instate rival Michigan State. Michigan ended the regular season with a 23\u20135 overall record and a 14\u20133 conference record (.823 conference winning percentage). Michigan's Big Ten regular season championship was their first since 2014. The Wolverines received an at-large bid to the 2021 NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed in the East region, where they defeated No. 16 Texas Southern and No. 8 LSU to advance to their fourth straight Sweet Sixteen. They then defeated No. 4 Florida State before being upset by No. 11 UCLA in the Elite Eight.\nThe 2021\u201322 Wolverines finished the regular season with a 17\u201313 overall record (11\u20139 Big Ten) and lost their first game of the Big Ten tournament to Indiana. Michigan managed to make the 2022 NCAA tournament as a No. 11 seed, beating No. 6 Colorado State and No. 3 Tennessee to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for a fifth consecutive season. In the round Michigan lost to Villanova to end their tournament.\nIn each of the following two seasons, the Wolverines failed to make the NCAA tournament with Howard. It was the first time Michigan did not make the NCAA tournament in back-to-back years since the 2007\u201308 team. On March 15, 2024, after losing a program record 24 games, the university announced it was parting ways with Howard after five years.\n\nMay era (2024\u2013present)\nOn March 23, 2024, Dusty May was named the head basketball coach at the University of Michigan. In his first month, he led the 2024\u201325 Wolverines to being the Fort Myers Tip-Off champions, and ranked inside the top 15 of the AP poll for the first time since November 2021. Michigan finished the regular season tied for second place at 14\u20136 in the conference and earned the No. 3 seed in the 2025 Big Ten tournament. On March 16, the Wolverines won the Big Ten tournament against Wisconsin, their first tournament title since 2018. May became the first officially recognized conference coach to win the Big Ten tournament title in their first season, with the only other being Brian Ellerbe in Michigan\u2019s first win in 1998; though that season was later vacated by the NCAA. May also won the most total games and conference games in program history for a first-year head coach. Michigan received an automatic bid to the 2025 NCAA tournament as the No. 5 seed in the South Region.On March 20, the Wolverines defeated No. 12 seed UC San Diego, 68\u201365, in the First Round. With 26 wins, May became the winningest first-year head coach in program history. On March 22, Michigan defeated No. 4 seed Texas A&M in the Second Round 91\u201379, winning a fifth consecutive postseason game. No team in NCAA history has ever lost as many games the season before and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen the next year (since introduced in 1975). On March 28, Michigan lost to the No. 1 overall seed Auburn in the regional semifinal, 65\u201378. The Wolverines finished the year 27\u201310, an increase of 19 wins from the previous season.\n\nChampionships\nNCAA National Championships\nBig Ten regular season championships\n+ Conference co-champions\n\nBig Ten tournament championships\nRivalries\nDuke\u2013Michigan\nMichigan\u2013Michigan State\nMichigan\u2013Ohio State\n\nRecord against Big Ten opponents\nTotals through March 16, 2025\n\nFab Five\nThe Fab Five, the 1991 recruiting class of five freshman starters, were Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having gone to the championship game of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy gym shorts, which was later popularized by Michael Jordan, and for wearing black athletic socks. Due to the issues found with Webber\u2019s eligibility in the Ed Martin scandal, the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been vacated. Although Webber was the only member of the Fab Five officially implicated with the scandal, the reputation of the whole group has been tarnished. Webber (1993), Howard (1994) and Rose (1992, 1994) were college basketball All-Americans. and both King (1995 3rd team and 1993 & 1994 honorable mention) and Jackson (1995 2nd team & 1994 honorable mention) achieved All-Big Ten honors. All but Jackson played in the NBA. They were the subject of Mitch Albom's book, Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream, which at one point was under development by Fox Television as a made-for-television movie. In March 2011 ESPN broadcast a documentary, Fab Five, that was the network's highest-rated in its history.\n\nEd Martin scandal\nDuring the University of Michigan basketball scandal the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Justice investigated the relationship between the University of Michigan, its men's basketball teams and basketball team booster Ed Martin. The program was punished for NCAA rules violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It is one of the largest incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. It was described as one of the three or four worst violations of NCAA bylaws in history up to that time by the NCAA infractions committee chairman and the largest athlete payment scandal ever by ESPN.\nThe case began when the investigation of an automobile rollover accident during Mateen Cleaves' 1996 Michigan Wolverines recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the team. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated over the next few years and by 1999 several were called before a federal grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball players (Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock) were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin. Eventually he confessed to having accepted some of the money he was charged with having borrowed. For his perjury during a federal grand jury investigation, he was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by National Basketball Association after performing public service.\nIn 2002, the university punished itself when it became apparent that its players were guilty by declaring itself ineligible for post season play immediately, returning post season play monetary rewards, vacating five seasons of games, removing commemorative banners, and placing itself on a two-year probation. The following year, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the probation period and the post-season ineligibility, penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered disassociation from the four guilty players until 2012. The disassociation formally ended on May 8, 2013. The additional year of post-season ineligibility was overturned on appeal.\nThe punishment cost the 2002\u201303 team its post-season eligibility, cost past teams the 1997 National Invitation Tournament and the 1998 Big Ten tournament championships as well as 1992 and 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament Final Four recognition. It cost Traylor his MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader in 3-point field goals. Steve Fisher lost his job as Michigan head coach as a result of the scandal.\n\nHead coaching history and current staff\nPersonnel\nCurrent coaching staff\nCurrent record\nHonored players and coaches\nBelow are lists of important players and coaches in the history of Michigan Wolverines men's basketball.

    "summary": "The Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Michigan. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and play their home games at Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Wolverines have won one NCAA Championship, three National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), 15 Big Ten regular season titles and four Big Ten tournaments. One NIT title and one Big Ten tournament were later vacated by the NCAA due to sanctions. \nMichigan has had 35 All-Americans, selected 48 times. Eight of these have been consensus All-Americans, which are Cazzie Russell (twice), Rickey Green, Gary Grant, Chris Webber, Trey Burke, as well as Harry Kipke, Richard Doyle and Bennie Oosterbaan (twice) who were retroactively selected by the Helms Foundation. Twelve All-Americans have been at least two-time honorees. Russell was the only three-time All-American.\nSeventy-seven players have been drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA); thirty-two of those were first round draft picks, including both Cazzie Russell and Chris Webber who were selected first overall. The 1990 NBA draft, in which Rumeal Robinson was selected 10th, Loy Vaught was selected 13th, and Terry Mills was selected 16th made Michigan the third of only ten schools that have ever had three or more players selected in the first round of the same draft. Six players have gone on to become NBA champions for a total of nine times and eight players have become NBA All-Stars a total of 18 times. Rudy Tomjanovich coached both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals champions. Glen Rice is one of only thirteen basketball players to have won a high school state championship, NCAA title and NBA championship.\nDuring the 1990s Michigan endured an NCAA violations scandal, described as involving one of the largest amounts of illicit money in NCAA history, when Ed Martin loaned four players a reported total of $616,000. Due to sanctions, records starting in the 1992 Final Four, the 1992\u201393 season, and the 1995\u201396 season through the 1998\u201399 season were vacated by the NCAA.

    "biography": "The Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball team represents the University of Minnesota in NCAA Division I college basketball competition. The Golden Gophers competes in the Big Ten Conference and play their home games at the Williams Arena.\nThe Gophers had great success in the early years of basketball, but have been largely overshadowed by other programs since the end of World War I.  In total, the Gophers have won nine Big Ten championships, but only four since 1919. College basketball research organizations have retroactively awarded Minnesota national championships in 1902, 1903, and 1919.\nThe team has also had several instances of NCAA sanctions on the program that have affected performance and recruiting. In the 1970s, the Gophers were in a violent brawl with the Ohio State Buckeyes and were barred from post-season appearances for two seasons after an incident involving the illegal resale of tickets. Still more severe was the mid-1990s academic scandal under then-coach Clem Haskins that resulted in the forfeit of a Final Four appearance.\n\nCoaches\nInitially, the Gophers team formed without any organized coach.  Despite this setback, in the team's first recorded match, they scraped out a 5-4 victory against an opponent christened only as \"Company A.\"  They would finish their first season with a 3-5 record.  L. J. Cooke took over the team in 1897. Cooke was put on the university payroll on a part-time basis in early 1897 and full-time by the fall; this made him one of the earliest professional coaches.\nCooke remained the coach of the Gophers for 28 seasons, and his .649 winning percentage is the second highest in school history. Dave MacMillan, who coached the team from 1927 to 1942 and 1945 to 1948, had the second longest tenure as coach at 18 seasons. John Wooden almost succeeded McMillan as Gophers head coach; Wooden claims that a dispute over retaining McMillan as an assistant coach and a delayed phone call led him to accept the job at UCLA instead.\nThe Gophers have had several NBA coaches grace the sidelines. John Kundla took over as Gophers head coach after the Minneapolis Lakers departed for Los Angeles. George Hanson was assistant coach under both Kundla and Fitch and was head coach for the 1970\u201371 season. Bill Fitch and Bill Musselman both coached the team for a couple seasons before departing for the NBA and ABA respectively, where each had success and coached for many years.\nThe program has had a fair degree of stability with their coaching staff. Tubby Smith became the 16th head coach in Gopher basketball history when hired in 2007; this total includes interim coaches Jim Molinari and Jimmy Williams. Five coaches led the team for more than 10 seasons: Cooke, McMillan, O. B. Cowles, Jim Dutcher, and Clem Haskins.  On March 25, 2013, Tubby Smith was fired after failing to reach the Sweet Sixteen again. The Gophers hired Richard Pitino on April 3, 2013. He was fired on March 15, 2021, after eight seasons, and replaced the following week by former assistant coach and seasoned recruiter, Ben Johnson.\n\nPlayers\nThe Golden Gophers have had many successful players come through the program throughout its history. In the early years of basketball, when the Gophers had success, they recruited some of the best players in the country. George Tuck was a dominant center, and the first All-America for the Gophers in 1905. Frank Lawler was another early star: he led the Big Ten in scoring in 1911 and was also named to the All-America team, and helped the Gophers to a contested conference title.\nIn 1950, Lawler was named the greatest player in Gopher basketball history, but the subsequent decades of Gopher basketball have largely forgotten his legacy.  Hall of Fame coach John Kundla was also a Gophers star and helped lead the team to its 1937 Big Ten Championship.\n\nWith the decline of the stature of the Gophers program, fewer elite players have joined the team. The diminished reputation has not, however, prevented some superior athletes from coming to the Minneapolis campus. Lou Hudson played 13 years in the NBA and had his number retired. Baseball Hall of Famer Dave Winfield played for the Gophers in the early 1970s, and he played at the same time as star post player Jim Brewer. Mychal Thompson was a Gophers star and was the first overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft. Among Thompson's teammates were former Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards head coach Flip Saunders, as well as Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame forward Kevin McHale. Trent Tucker led the 1982 squad to the Big Ten Championship. Voshon Lenard was a key player for the Gophers in the early 1990s and went on to play more than a decade in the NBA. Willie Burton once scored 53 points in an NBA game with the Philadelphia 76ers. Other former Gophers with long NBA careers include Randy Breuer, Mark Olberding, Archie Clark, Jim Petersen, and Ray Williams. Five players from the 1997 Final Four team played in the NBA: Bobby Jackson, Sam Jacobson, Quincy Lewis, John Thomas, and Trevor Winter. Currently Amir Coffey (Los Angeles Clippers) is a former Gopher who plays in the NBA. Jamal Abu-Shamala, a Palestinian-American, played internationally for the Jordan national basketball team in 2008 and the Palestine national basketball team since 2011, and Marcus Carr plays overseas in the Israeli Basketball Premier League.\n\nCurrent roster\nThis roster is current for the 2024\u201325 men's basketball season.\n\nRetired numbers\nHistory\nProgram establishment (1895\u20131927)\nThe precise founding of the Gophers men's basketball program at the University of Minnesota is somewhat nebulous. Unlike many other universities with later foundations, the team did not form as a conscious act of the campus administration. The university's student newspaper at the time, the Ariel, reported on basketball throughout 1895 as the sport was introduced to the campus from a rival school, Minnesota A&M in St. Paul, later incorporated into the larger University of Minnesota Twin Cities. In 1896, a team from the school began to participate in a league with the Agriculture school, YMCA teams, and other local associations. The establishment of the Armory on-campus gave the team a new place to play. In February 1897, L. J. Cooke, a director of the Minneapolis YMCA, was hired on a part-time basis to coach the basketball program, and became the full-time coach and director of physical education by the fall of that year. Cooke was one of the first full-time professional coaches in all of college basketball and would remain at the program for 28 seasons.\nCooke began to improve the team significantly and was responsible for shifts in the Gophers' scheduling that foreshadowed other changes to come. The team never played a YMCA team after the 1903\u201304 season, and beginning in 1900, began to schedule large neighboring universities that would join Minnesota in Big Ten competition. This shift to playing similar competition helped the Gophers to become one of the premier programs in the nation. From the 1899\u20131900 to 1903\u201304 seasons, the Gophers had a 59\u20136 record. The 1901\u201302 squad has been retroactively named the national champions by both the Helms Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll; the Premo-Porretta poll also names the 1902\u201303 Gophers as national champions. When the Big Ten established basketball in 1905, the Gophers won the first two conference titles.\nAfter 1907, Cooke's dominance of the national basketball scene was greatly reduced. He led the team to two more conference titles (1916\u201317, 1918\u201319), and one consensus retroactive national championship for the 1918\u201319 season, but the team was never the consistent winner that it was in the first decade under Cooke. He retired after the 1923\u20131924 season. His successor, Harold Taylor, was Cooke's assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach; however, he had little success with the Gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in the conference in three forgettable seasons.\n\nDave MacMillan and beyond (1927\u20131959)\nFollowing the firing of Harold Taylor as coach, the program underwent a national search for a successor. Many of the candidates for the job were high-profile coaches of other conference foes.  The team opted, however, to hire Dave MacMillan, who had been coaching the University of Idaho for the previous seven seasons and had previously played for the Original Celtics during the 1910s. MacMillan would dominate the program for the next 30 years, coaching the team from 1927 to 1942 and again from 1945 to 1948.\nMacMillan's teams in 1928 began to play in the University of Minnesota Field House, a new on-campus arena. Basketball had been off-campus for several seasons when the team moved downtown.  MacMillan's teams had middling success.  His 1930\u201331 and 1931\u201332 teams competed near the top of the Big Ten, but his teams dropped off again until 1936. John Kundla joined the team for the 1936\u20131937 season and helped the team to the Big Ten Championship, which was ended up being its last until 1972. MacMillan's squad also competed in a tournament in 1936 to represent the United States in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin; the team advanced several rounds before being ousted by DePaul. Many Gophers players in this era were recruited from Minneapolis public high schools, and in some seasons this even constituted a majority of the roster. McMillan resigned in 1942, but returned in 1945 after three poor seasons for the Gophers in the interim. When he resigned for the second time in 1948, he was replaced by O. B. Cowles.\nCowles was known for playing slower tempo basketball like was most common in the 1920s and 1930s and was known as a defensive-minded coach, especially early in his career. His squads were led by two-time All-American Jim McIntyre and three-time NBA Champion Whitey Skoog for the early years of his career and Big Ten MVP Chuck Mencel for the middle ones. Another notable Gophers star from the era was Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Bud Grant. Cowles had a .612 winning percentage at the school. The Gophers were unable to win a Big Ten title, however, despite a solid nucleus in Cowles's early seasons. The team finished fourth or better in the conference seven times in Cowles's 11 seasons as Gopher head coach.\n\nKundla and Fitch (1959\u20131971)\nIn 1959, John Kundla stayed behind in Minneapolis as the Lakers prepared to leave town and succeeded O. B. Cowles as head coach of the Golden Gophers. Kundla remained head coach until 1968.  In 1963, he broke the color barrier in the Minnesota program and recruited three African-American players to come to the school. One of these first three players was Lou Hudson, who played in the NBA and was the first Gopher to have his number retired by the school. The other two players recruited by Kundla, Archie Clark and Don Yates, also were both drafted by NBA teams. That trio helped the Gophers to a third place Big Ten finish in 1963\u201364 and a second-place finish in 1964\u201365, but those were the high points for Kundla's collegiate career. Kundla's personal assessment of his Gophers career was that his personal weaknesses in recruiting were marring the team by the end of his tenure.\nKundla was succeeded by Bowling Green head coach Bill Fitch. Fitch remained with the Gophers for two seasons before being hired by the Cleveland Cavaliers as their first head coach in 1970 to make the leap to the NBA, where he later won an NBA title as coach of the Boston Celtics. Fitch did recruit Jim Brewer before he left, laying the first seed for the 1972 Big Ten title. George Hanson, a longtime assistant coach at the school, was hired as his replacement, but resigned after only one season.\n\nMusselman and NCAA sanctions (1971\u20131975)\nThe Gophers under Athletics Director Marsh Ryman hired Cal Luther away from Murray State to coach the team in 1971, but he changed his mind and turned the team down after accepting the position. Instead, Bill Musselman took over the program. Musselman was a defensive minded coach and designed his team around Brewer, recruiting several junior college players. University of Minnesota baseball star Dave Winfield also joined the team in 1971. The starters on the 1971\u201372 squad after the Ohio State game became known as the \"Iron Five.\" Musselman's strategy succeeded, and the team took the Big Ten title, the first since 1937. The other Big Ten coaches did not approve of Musselman's recruiting posture as they all had gathered and agreed not to recruit Ron Behagen into the Big Ten because he was known as a troublemaker. Musselman had not been named Head Coach of Minnesota at that time and therefore was unaware of the internal agreement and therefore recruited what he thought were the best players available.\nIn 1973, former player Greg Olson accused Musselman of having attempted to strike him in a practice.  It was also revealed that Olson had sold complimentary season tickets to a booster named Harvey Mackay, which prompted NCAA investigations.  Musselman's coaching style also brought about significant transfers away from the Minnesota program to other schools. In 1975, Musselman resigned and was named the head coach of the San Diego Sails of the ABA. After his resignation, Musselman admitted to giving money to players for rent and transportation. These charges, coupled with the earlier ticket selling scandal and other transgressions regarding payments and aid revolving around Harvey Mackay, resulted in a list from the NCAA of more than 100 rule violations in Musselman's four seasons at the school. The extent of the consequences would not be known until early in Jim Dutcher's eleven season tenure as Gophers head coach.\n\nThe Jim Dutcher era (1975-1986)\nDutcher took over the Gophers program in 1975 following the departure of Bill Musselman. The highlight of his time at Minnesota was 1982, a season in which he led the Gophers to the Big Ten Championship \u2014 to date, the last \"official\" conference title for the Gophers \u2014 and a Sweet 16 appearance. He was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year in 1982.\nProminent players coached by Dutcher at Minnesota included Ray Williams, who later played for the New York Knicks; Mychal Thompson, who played for the Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers; Kevin McHale, who played for the Boston Celtics; Trent Tucker, who played for the New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls; Randy Breuer, who played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings; Flip Saunders, who became an NBA coach for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons, and Washington Wizards; Osborne Lockhart, who played for the Harlem Globetrotters; Jim Petersen, who played for the Houston Rockets; Darrell Mitchell, who was named first-team All-Big Ten, and Tommy Davis, also a first-team All-Big Ten player.\nOn January 25, 1986, three Gopher players were arrested on rape charges in Madison, Wisconsin. A Madison woman claimed the players raped her at their team hotel hours after the Gophers played the Wisconsin Badgers. After the arrests, U of M officials canceled the Gophers' next scheduled game, against Northwestern, citing the arrests and a series of less serious incidents prior to the arrests. Not agreeing with the university's decision to forfeit the game, Dutcher resigned as head coach, Jimmy Williams served as the interim coach the rest of the season. All three players were ultimately acquitted of all charges.\n\nSuccess, and scandal, under Haskins (1986\u20131999)\nClem Haskins was hired as the Gopher basketball coach in 1986, expected to clean up and rebuild the Gopher program which had been torn apart by the Madison sexual assault allegations (of which the players were later acquitted) during the final year of coach Jim Dutcher.  Though wins did not come easily in the first couple years of Haskins regime, by the 1988\u201389 season he had the Gophers in the 1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a #11 seed, and directed a Cinderella run into the Sweet 16. In the 1989\u201390 season Haskins led the Gophers on another cinderella run in the 1990 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. This time as a No. 6 seed, the Gophers went all the way to the Elite Eight, and came within a basket of reaching their first ever Final Four. Though Haskins led the Gophers to post-season success in his first three seasons, the 1990 Elite Eight appearance would be the last time under Haskins the Gophers would \"officially\" appear in the NCAA tournament, due to their future tournament results being vacated as a result of NCAA violations.\nProminent players coached by Haskins at Minnesota included Minnesota native Sam Jacobson, who went on to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, and hometown Minnesota Timberwolves, Sharp-shooter Voshon Lenard, who spent 5 seasons with the Miami Heat and won the 2004 Three-Point Contest, Quincy Lewis, who was a 3rd Team All American and played for the Utah Jazz and Minnesota Timberwolves, and Bobby Jackson who under Haskins was a Consensus All American and Big Ten Player Of The Year, before going on to play 12 seasons in the NBA, most prominently for the Sacramento Kings, where he won the 2003 Sixth Man of the Year Award, and now serves as an assistant coach. Big men John Thomas, Joel Przybilla, and Trevor Winter (the latter two both Minnesota natives), also flourished under Haskins and went on to have careers in the NBA.\n\nAcademic fraud scandal\nOn March 10, 1999, the day before the #7 seed Gophers were to open the NCAA tournament against #10 Gonzaga, the St. Paul Pioneer Press ran a story detailing allegations of massive academic fraud in the men's basketball program.  Former basketball office manager Jan Gangelhoff had gone to the newspaper claiming she had written over 400 papers for at least 20 Gopher men's basketball players over a period of several years, ending in 1998. When the Gophers played Gonzaga on March 11, the university suspended players Antoine Broxsie, Kevin Clark, Jason Stanford, and Miles Tarver since they allegedly had papers written for them by Ganglehoff in previous seasons. With their roster depleted, the Gophers lost to Gonzaga, the season came to an end, and an internal investigation at the university began.\nBy June 1999 and in the midst of their investigation, the university had negotiated a buyout of the remainder of Haskins' contract, worth $1.5 million over three years. It also withdrew from postseason consideration in the 1999\u20132000 season and docked itself 11 scholarships over four years. In the summer of 2000, Haskins came forward and admitted that he had paid Gangelhoff $3,000 for her services; this revelation came to light after Haskins turned his financial records over to the NCAA. In addition, more details were emerging in which Haskins was also accused of mail fraud in an incident regarding a recruit's transcript, giving players cash, dismissing sexual harassment concerns against his players, as well as his staff trying to persuade professors to give his players inflated grades they had not earned.\n\n  After the details of Haskins' ever-growing involvement became more clear, the university initiated legal action to recover the buyout money. A judge ultimately ruled that Haskins must return just over half of the original $1.5 million buyout.\nDuring this time an NCAA investigation was also underway.  Ultimately, it revealed that Minnesota was guilty of massive violations under Haskins' watch.  The NCAA stripped the Gophers of all postseason awards, titles, personal records, and statistics dating back to the 1993\u201394 season citing a \"lack of institutional control.\" Haskins was also slapped with a seven-year \"show-cause\" order, which effectively banned him from coaching at any level in the NCAA until 2007. Besides lying about the $3,000 payment, he had also told several of his players to lie to the NCAA. Later, the Big Ten forced the Gophers to vacate their 1997 conference title, as well as all regular season games dating to 1993\u201394. As a result, Minnesota's official record from 1993\u201394 to 1998\u201399 is 0\u20130. If not for the vacated games, Haskins would be the second-winningest coach in school history.\nIn addition, the NCAA docked the Gophers an additional five scholarships over the following three seasons, and also imposed recruiting limitations and department-wide probation lasting four years.\nIn addition to Haskins, Athletic Director Mark Dienhart, Vice President for Athletics, Student Development McKinley Boston, Associate Athletics Director Jeff Schemmel and academic counselor Alonzo Newby also resigned. The university also agreed to return 90% (approximately $350,000) of the profits earned by the basketball program during their appearances in the NCAA tournament, including the 1997 Final Four run.\n\nThe Monson era (1999\u20132006)\nFollowing Haskins' departure, the university hired Gonzaga's Dan Monson to be their next head coach, who coincidentally had just beaten the Gophers in the NCAA Tournament the previous March.  Monson was the coach for part of eight seasons.  However, during his tenure the scholarship reductions took their full effect, making it difficult for him to recruit on the same level as the rest of the Big Ten.  His Gopher teams only made the NCAA tournament once, in 2004\u201305. Monson almost left the Minnesota program for the University of Washington following the 2001\u201302 season, but was thought of highly by the athletics department under Tom Moe and was persuaded to stay despite limited success. These trends did not reverse after he remained at the program. \nDuring his final full season the Gophers were 5\u201311 in Big Ten play, and after a 2\u20135 start to open the 2006\u201307 season, Monson and Athletics Director Joel Maturi announced Monson's resignation on November 30, 2006. Despite Monson's inability to field a consistent winner, he was lauded by University officials for bringing integrity and cleanliness back to the program. Assistant coach Jim Molinari was named head coach on an interim basis and, after a 3\u201313 Big Ten record to finish the season, was not retained as head coach. Maturi began an extensive search for a new permanent head coach at season's end.\n\nThe Tubby Smith era (2007\u20132013)\nOn March 23, 2007, Maturi made a move that surprised many when he hired Tubby Smith after he resigned from the University of Kentucky to be the next head Gopher basketball coach. Smith's name recognition and winning reputation gave the program a new optimism, something it badly needed to counter its dwindling fan interest.\nSmith's coaching had an immediate impact on the previously unsuccessful Gophers squad. The team went from 8\u201322 in 2006\u201307 to 20\u201313 in 2007\u201308. Smith also led the Golden Gophers to the Big Ten tournament semi-finals after defeating 2nd seeded Indiana. Coach Smith also signed a top 25 recruiting class, the best in years for the program. Smith returned Minnesota to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005 in the 2008\u201309 season. Smith's team struggled throughout the 2009\u201310 season with off-court issues, but advanced to the championship game in the Big Ten tournament for the first time in school history (losing to regular season co-champion Ohio State) and made the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive season.\nOn March 25, 2013, Smith was relieved of his coaching duties at Minnesota.\n\nThe Richard Pitino era (2013\u20132021)\nOn April 3, 2013, Richard Pitino, son of Louisville coach Rick Pitino, verbally agreed to coach the Golden Gophers.  On April 3, after missing out on the NCAA tournament, the Gophers responded by winning the 2014 NIT championship trophy by defeating SMU. Austin Hollins was named the NIT MVP. As a result, Pitino claimed his first championship with the team. Following the success of an NIT championship, the Gophers hoped to qualify for the NCAA tournament the following year. However, the team struggled and finished with only six wins in the conference and did not qualify for any major tournament.\nThe 2016 season was a disaster for the Gophers as they only managed to win two conference games. The lone bright spot came during a late season upset against ranked Maryland to give the Gophers their first conference win on the season. Despite the lack of success on the court, the Gophers were able to get Amir Coffey, a highly ranked player from Hopkins to commit to the men's basketball program. Coffey, along with other recruits Eric Curry and Michael Hurt, were able to help lift the Gophers to a 23-8 regular season record in the 2016\u20132017 season, and a berth to the 2017 NCAA tournament, where they attained a 5 seed and lost to 12-seed Middle Tennessee State to finish with a 24\u201310 record. Expectations were high coming into the 2017\u20132018 season, as they only lost one rotational player, Akeem Springs, from the year before. This was evident as Minnesota received its highest preseason ranking in the AP poll since 1993, coming in at 15th. Before the season, things started to unravel for Pitino's team. Sophomore Eric Curry tore his ACL and MCL in late August, forcing him to miss the entirety of the 2017\u20132018 season. During the beginning of the season, sexual assault allegations came out against senior center Reggie Lynch, which resulted in Lynch's suspension and eventual expulsion from the University of Minnesota. Later in the season, sophomore Amir Coffey suffered a shoulder injury and ended up missing the last 12 games of the season. The Gophers ended the season 15\u201317, with a 4\u201314 record in conference play and a first round loss to Rutgers in the 2018 Big Ten tournament. The 2018\u20132019 season went much better for the Gophers. They finished with a record of 22\u201313, although they only went 9\u201311 in conference play. Still, after strong wins over No. 20 Wisconsin, and No. 11 Purdue twice, the Gophers finished 4th in the 2019 Big Ten tournament and returned to post-season play as a 10 seed in the East Region of the 2019 NCAA tournament. In the tournament, the Gophers beat the 7 seed Louisville Cardinals in the first round 86\u201376.  In the Round of 32, the Gophers lost to the Michigan State Spartans 70\u201350, who would end up the champions of the East Region.\n\nThe Ben Johnson era (2021\u20132025)\nIn March 2005, the University of Minnesota hired Nico Medved as head coach. He was previously ato helm the Men's Basketball program for its next era.  On March 13, 2025, Johnson was fired after four seasons without NCAA tournament appearances.\n\nThe Niko Medved era (2025\u2013current)\nOn March 22, 2021, the University of Minnesota hired Niko Medved, a Roseville, Minnesota, high school graduate who went on the graduate from the U of M. A Minnesota kid, Medved had been assistant coach at Macalester, University of Minnesota, Furman, and Colorado State. He went on to become a head coach at Furman, Colorado State, and Drake.\n\nAwards\nBig Ten MVP\n\nChuck Mencel \u2013 1955\nJim Brewer \u2013 1972\nMychal Thompson \u2013 1978\nBobby Jackson \u2013 1997 (later revoked due to the academic fraud scandal)\nBig Ten Coach of the Year\n\nJim Dutcher \u2013 1982\nClem Haskins \u2013 1997 (later revoked due to the academic fraud scandal)\nRichard Pitino \u2013 2017\nHenry Iba Award (National Coach of the Year)\n\nClem Haskins \u2013 1997\nBig Ten Defensive Player of the Year\n\nBobby Jackson \u2013 1997 (later revoked due to the academic fraud scandal)\nTravarus Bennett \u2013 2002\nReggie Lynch \u2013 2017\nBig Ten Freshman of the Year\n\nRick Rickert \u2013 2002\nKris Humphries \u2013 2004\nConsensus All-Americans\n\nJim McIntyre \u2013 1948\nDick Garmaker \u2013 1955\nMychal Thompson \u2013 1978\nAcademic All-American\n\nBlake Hoffarber \u2013 2011 (2nd Team)\n\nPost-season\nThe Gophers enjoyed fairly regular post season appearances under former coach Clem Haskins, making the post season in 10 of his 13 seasons as coach (6 NCAA tournament, 4 NIT), including all of his last 8 seasons. The team advanced to one Final 4, one Elite 8, one Sweet 16, one second round appearance, and suffered two first round losses.  However, after the academic fraud scandal in 1999, the last 6 years of post season records were wiped out. So officially, the Gophers made 2 NCAA Tournament and 2 NIT appearances in the 13 years Haskins was coach.  They advanced to the Elite 8 in 1990, the Sweet 16 in 1989, and were NIT champions in 1993.\nThe Gophers saw some moderate success in the early 1980s, appearing in the 1980, 1981, and 1983 NITs and the 1982 NCAA tournament, where they advanced to the Sweet 16.\nMultiple problems plagued the Gophers during the 1976\u20131977 season, Jim Dutcher's 2nd as head coach.  Heading into the season the team knew they would not be eligible for the post season because of sanctions from the Bill Musselman era.  Even so, this turned out to be one of the best teams in Gopher history, with the team finishing at 24\u20133.  But if not being post-season eligible was not punishment enough, it was later found out that Mychal Thompson had sold two complimentary tickets to Gopher home games.  When it was discovered, the profits were donated to University of Minnesota scholarship funds.  The school and several prominent supporters, including Senator Wendell Anderson attempted to back Thompson and the team.  Nevertheless, when the NCAA discovered Thompson's act, Minnesota's record for the season was forfeited and the accomplishments of that season are considered unofficial and not included in NCAA records.\n\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Golden Gophers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 14 times. Their combined record is 15\u201313. However, their tournament appearances from 1972, 1994, 1995 & 1997 have been vacated making their official record 9\u201310.\n\n* Vacated by the NCAA\n\nNIT results\nThe Golden Gophers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 16 times. Their combined record is 34\u201314. They were NIT Champions in 1993, 1998 and 2014. However, their tournament appearances in 1996 and 1998 have been vacated, including their 1998 title, making their official record 28\u201313.\n\n* Vacated by the NCAA\n\nFacilities\nWhen the Gophers first organized, they played games in the on campus YMCA.  In 1896, the team moved into the campus Armory, a large building with gymnasium space for the team to use, even if basketball was not its primary purpose.  They remained in the Armory for almost 30 years.  Halfway through the 1924\u201325 season, coach Harold Taylor moved the team from the University Armory to the Kenwood Armory in downtown Minneapolis.  This significantly increased the attendance; capacity at the University Armory was 2,000, and it was 6,500 at Kenwood.  The team only played at Kenwood for a few seasons, however, as the University of Minnesota Field House \u2014 later known as Williams Arena \u2014 opened partway through the 1927\u20131928 season.  The team moved in on January 31, 1928.\nThe Field House increased attendance capacity further, to 9,500.  It was named after Henry L. Williams, the former Minnesota Golden Gophers football coach in 1950, and was named after him when it was remodeled and expanded in 1950, bringing the arena to a capacity of 18,025, which was the largest in the country for 20 years and significantly larger than the capacity of Williams Arena today.  Gophers fans refer to Williams Arena as the Barn.  Consequently, the student section is known as The Barnyard.  Williams Arena was remodeled in 1993 again, to create a new facility for the women's team to use.  The team continues to play there to this day, making it one of the longest used arenas of any college basketball team and the oldest arena in the Big ten.  Williams Arena is also one of the few remaining arenas with a raised court, in which players have to go up stairs to reach the playing surface.\n\nRivals\nIn the early years of the program, the Gophers had several rivalries that have not extended into the modern era.  Among them was a rivalry with Hamline University, now a Division III school in St. Paul.  Hamline had one of the earliest college basketball programs in the country and it was several years before Minnesota competed on equal footing with them; they played as late as 1935.  The greatest rival of the early years of the program was the Minnesota Aggies, representing the Minnesota School of Agriculture and Mining, which has since been incorporated into the University of Minnesota Twin Cities as the St. Paul campus.  Minnesota A&M dominated the Gophers, winning ten consecutive games; Minnesota did not get its first win against the Aggies until 1899.  This rivalry expired especially early, and the two teams did not meet after 1901.\nThe Gophers were also an active participant in the early rivalry between Eastern schools and Midwestern schools for basketball preeminence.  Minnesota broke up a stretch of Ivy League dominance from 1901 to 1906 with their successful 1902 season.  The Eastern teams \u2013 Yale, Columbia, and Dartmouth were early powers \u2013 played with a more physical approach, while Midwestern teams used a different method.  Wisconsin coach Walter Meanwell used the motion offense and \"stress[ed] finesse.\"  W.C. Hyatt, who played for Yale, claimed that \"The Minnesota and Wisconsin men played in the style prevalent among most of the girl colleges in the East, that is, the 'no contact' game.\"\nIn the modern era of the program, as is the case with most Big Ten sports, Minnesota's primary rivals are the Iowa Hawkeyes and Wisconsin Badgers. In recent years, the rivalry with Wisconsin has become more intense than that with Iowa, primarily due to Wisconsin's rise to basketball powerhouse on the court.  Minnesota and Wisconsin's games together count towards the Border Battle, an annual trophy given to the points winner of several sports played between the two schools throughout the year.\nThe Gophers also have a less heralded rivalry with Ohio State.  The two teams have very little history together, outside of the 1972 brawl between the teams at Williams Arena.  That incident still lingers in the hearts of many long-time Buckeye fans.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",
    "summary": "The Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball team represents the University of Minnesota in NCAA Division I college basketball competition. The Golden Gophers competes in the Big Ten Conference and play their home games at the Williams Arena.\nThe Gophers had great success in the early years of basketball, but have been largely overshadowed by other programs since the end of World War I.  In total, the Gophers have won nine Big Ten championships, but only four since 1919. College basketball research organizations have retroactively awarded Minnesota national championships in 1902, 1903, and 1919.\nThe team has also had several instances of NCAA sanctions on the program that have affected performance and recruiting. In the 1970s, the Gophers were in a violent brawl with the Ohio State Buckeyes and were barred from post-season appearances for two seasons after an incident involving the illegal resale of tickets. Still more severe was the mid-1990s academic scandal under then-coach Clem Haskins that resulted in the forfeit of a Final Four appearance.",

    "biography": "The Mississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball program represents Mississippi State University near Starkville, Mississippi in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The Bulldogs play in the Southeastern Conference. Mississippi State has qualified for the NCAA tournament 13 times and most recently in 2024. The Bulldogs best finish in the NCAA tournament came in 1996 when they advanced to the Final Four. On March 20, 2022, Mississippi State named former New Mexico State head coach Chris Jans as its 21st head basketball coach.\n\nHistory\nThe Bulldogs have been to the NCAA Tournament eleven times, the first time in 1963 and the most recent being 2024. Mississippi State chose not to accept previous bids because state officials viewed African-Americans as inferior and would not allow Ole Miss or Mississippi State to play against teams with African-American players.  The 1963 team, however, famously snuck out of the state in the dead of night to play in what has since been dubbed the \"Game of Change\".\nSix of the ten NCAA appearances have been earned in the past 10 seasons under former MSU Head Basketball Coach, Rick Stansbury. They have won 8 conference championships, two under coach Earl C. Hayes as a member of the now-dissolved Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1913 and 1914 in addition to six SEC titles in 1959, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1991, and 2004. The Bulldogs have won four conference tournament championships, one as a member of the Southern Conference in 1923 and three SEC tournament titles in 1996, 2002, and 2009. Mississippi State has several notable alumni including Erick Dampier, Bailey Howell, and Jarvis Varnado.\n\nRivals\nAs in all sports, Mississippi State's rival is Ole Miss. Mississippi State leads the series over Ole Miss 142\u2013112.  Former MSU Head Coach Rick Stansbury is 21\u20138 vs the Rebels. Former head coach Ben Howland, was 6\u20139 against the Rebels.\nMississippi State and Alabama are considered rivals on the court, with only 90 miles separating the two programs.

  "Murray State Racers": {
    "biography": "The Murray State Racers men's basketball program represents Murray State University in intercollegiate men's basketball. Murray State is a member of the Missouri Valley Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), having joined that conference in 2022 after 74 seasons in the Ohio Valley Conference. The Racers have played home games at the CFSB Center on their campus in Murray, Kentucky since 1998. Murray State made its 18th appearance in the NCAA tournament in 2022. Five times the Racers advanced in the tournament, most recently by defeating the University of San Francisco in 2022. In 1988, Murray State defeated NC State in the first round but lost to eventual national champion Kansas in the second round. In 2010, 22 years to the date of the 1988 win, the Racers beat Vanderbilt and lost to eventual runner-up Butler in the second round.\n\nVenues\nMurray State's first basketball venues were Wilson Hall (1926\u201327); Lovett Auditorium (1927\u20131937), which had a capacity of 1,500; and Carr Health Building (1937\u20131954), which had a capacity of 3,000. Racer Arena opened in 1954 and entertained Racer fans for 43 years. While its capacity was 5,500, over 6,000 people crowded the arena on numerous occasions. Racer Arena is now a volleyball-only facility, one of the largest in NCAA Division I.\n\nReplacing Racer Arena was the CFSB Center, the current home of Murray State men's basketball. Completed in June 1998 at a cost of $20 million, the facility is a modern arena which can host other events besides basketball. The CFSB Center sits 8,602 and includes a $250,000 scoreboard and a 2,000 sq. ft. weight room. The first basketball game at the CFSB Center was against Southern Illinois on November 14, 1998, a 65\u201362 victory for the Racers in front of 7,633 spectators. It was formerly known as the Regional Special Events Center, or \"RSEC\", until the name was changed on September 17, 2010, after Community Financial Services Bank donated $3.3 million to Murray State, at the time the largest donation in athletic history.\n\nHistory\nIn 2005, Street & Smith's named the Racers the 52nd best program of all time. In their prestige system, ESPN ranked Murray State the 30th best programs from 1984 to 2008, breaking a tie with Villanova due to a higher winning percentage. The Racers are the highest \"true\" mid-major team in their rankings.\n\nCutchin era (1925\u20131941)\nCarlisle Cutchin launched the Murray State basketball program in 1925. At the time, Murray State was a teacher's college and the nickname was the Thoroughbreds. In the 1935\u201336 season, Cutchin coached Murray State to its highest win percentage for a season at .920, when his Thoroughbreds finished with a record of 23\u20132. That season also included Murray State's best start, at 19\u20131. In his final season, he led the Thoroughbreds to the title game of the 1941 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament, at which time they lost to the San Diego State Aztecs 36\u201334. Since he retired in 1941, he has maintained his position as the all-time winningest coach in Murray State basketball history, with a career record of 267\u2013101.\n\nMountjoy era (1941\u20131942)\nRice Mountjoy was hired as the next men's basketball coach from Danville High School, where he was athletic director. In his only season with the Thoroughbreds, he coached the team to an 18\u20134 record. That season was marked by strong play from early jump shot proponent Joe Fulks, who transferred from Millsaps College. Mountjoy left after the 1941\u201342 season to coach Augusta Tilghman High School in nearby Paducah.\n\nMiller era (1942\u20131948)\nFormer Murray State basketball player and then-freshman team coach John Miller replaced Mountjoy as head basketball coach. His best season was his first, when he led the team to a 21\u20135 record and finished fourth in the 1941 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament.\n\nHodges era (1948\u20131954)\nFrom Southern Illinois, Harlan Hodges led the team to two NAIA Tournaments and two No. 16 AP rankings in his six seasons, with a 109\u201366 (.623) record.  Bennie Purcell and Garrett Beshear were on the roster during those years and were later named NAIA All-Americans. Hodges left Murray in May 1954 for the University of Idaho in the Pacific Coast Conference, where success largely eluded him.  He resigned after five seasons in 1959 to become the superintendent of schools in Anna, Illinois, then returned to Murray in 1964 to teach.\n\nAlexander era (1954\u20131958)\nRex Alexander was promoted from assistant to head coach after former North Carolina head coach Tom Scott accepted, then turned down the head coaching post at Murray State. Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45\u201354 record, including a 15\u201310 mark in 1955\u201356. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\nLuther era (1959\u20131974)\nIn 1958, Murray State hired Cal Luther, who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at DePauw. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA tournament in 1964 and 1969. His 1970\u201371 team reached No. 17 in the Associated Press poll, entering the rankings after a thrilling 73\u201371 victory over Western Kentucky in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the NCAA tournament Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241\u2013134 record.\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players Dick Cunningham, Claude Virden and Stewart Johnson, as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973\u201374 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\nOverton era (1975\u20131978)\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, Fred Overton was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9\u201317 first season, the Racers started the 1976\u201377 season with a 17\u20136 record before dropping their last four games for a 17\u201310 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8\u201317 in 1977\u201378, Overton was fired.\n\nGreene era (1978\u20131985)\nRon Greene returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65\u201363 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against Notre Dame.  Murray State defeated a Notre Dame team coached by Digger Phelps 56\u201354.\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119\u201378. While at the Racer helm, Greene coached Racer greats Gary Hooker and Lamont Sleets.\n\nNewton era (1985\u20131991)\nIn Steve Newton's second season, in 1986\u201387 the team finished with a 13\u201315 record. This marked the last time the Racers had a losing season for the next 29 seasons; only Arizona, Kansas, and Syracuse hold longer streaks.\nIn addition to Murray's win in 1988, two years later the No. 16 seed Racers took No. 1 seed Michigan State into overtime before falling 75\u201371. The loss in 1990 was the closest a 16 seeded team had ever come to knocking off a No. 1 seeded team in the tournament. While a 16 seeded Princeton team and a 16 seeded East Tennessee State team both fell by just 1 point during regulation in the 1989 tournament, the 1990 Murray State team was the only 16 seed ever to take a game into overtime. In 1997, the No. 15 seed Racers nearly shocked the No. 2 seed Duke Blue Devils in a 71\u201368 loss.\nIn 1988, Jeff Martin became the first basketball player in Murray State, and OVC, history to be invited to the Olympic trials for the US Basketball Team.  This was the last year that professionals were not allowed on the team.  Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is Popeye Jones.  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the Houston Rockets in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\nEdgar era (1992\u20131995)\nScott Edgar was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under Nolan Richardson at Arkansas. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances (1992, 1995) and one NIT appearance (1994) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48\u201314 record in conference games during his tenure.\nEdgar recruited Racer greats Marcus Brown and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994\u201395 season to become head coach at Duquesne.\n\nGottfried era (1995\u20131998)\nMark Gottfried was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under Jim Harrick at UCLA. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach Mike Gottfried.\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including Marcus Brown, from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival Austin Peay Governors. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70\u201368. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA tournament. The Racers lost to the Missouri Tigers in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19\u201310. Marcus Brown finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the Belmont Bruins, the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA tournament.\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.\nGottfried was hired by Alabama to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\nAnderson era (1998\u20132003)\nTevester Anderson was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after Mark Gottfried left Murray State to take the head coach position at the University of Alabama. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27\u20136 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999\u20132000 season with a 23\u20139 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to Southeast Missouri State University.\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17\u201312 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003. Anderson was named as the new head coach at Jackson State University in April 2003.\n\nCronin era (2003\u20132006)\nPreviously an assistant at Cincinnati (1997\u20132001) under Bob Huggins and at Louisville (2001\u201303) under Rick Pitino, Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on Western Kentucky Parkway near Leitchfield, Kentucky. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20\u201310 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.\nThe 2005\u201306 Racers rebounded from their struggles in the previous season to win both the OVC regular season title, their 1st since 2000, and the tournament title to return to the NCAA. In the 2006 tournament, junior guard Trey Pearson missed a critical 3-point shot in the final seconds of the first-round game against No. 3 seeded defending champion North Carolina.  UNC was fouled on the rebound and went to the line to sink the game clinching shots to defeat the No. 14 seeded Racers 69\u201365. After the 2006 NCAA tournament Cronin took the reins of the Cincinnati Bearcats, his hometown team and alma mater.\n\nKennedy era (2006\u20132011)\nOn April 12, 2006, Southeastern Louisiana head coach Billy Kennedy was introduced as Murray State University's head men's basketball coach, succeeding the recently departed Cronin.\nAfter continuing to contend in the conference over his first few seasons, Kennedy's 2009\u201310 team finally broke through, winning the program's 21st OVC regular season title with a conference record of 17\u20131. They would then go on to defeat Morehead State to capture their 14th OVC tournament title, clinching a berth in the NCAA tournament.\nThe Racers won their first-round game in the 2010 NCAA tournament in dramatic fashion, defeating fourth-seeded Vanderbilt 66\u201365 on a buzzer-beating jump shot by senior Danero Thomas. This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA tournament since Middle Tennessee advanced in 1989.\nThe Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the National Invitational Tournament where the Racers suffered a first round loss to Missouri State University. In May 2011, Billy Kennedy announced that he was leaving Murray State to accept the head coach position at Texas A&M University.\n\nFirst Prohm era (2011\u20132015)\nSteve Prohm was introduced as the 15th head coach on May 23, 2011. Prohm was promoted to the head coach position after serving as an assistant coach under Billy Kennedy for the previous five seasons. The Racers won the 2011 Great Alaska Shootout early in the 2011\u201312 season and went on a 23-game winning streak to start the season. The team's 23\u20130 start under Prohm was the best start to a season in team history. The 23\u20130 start beat the previous best start record of 16\u20130 set by the 1935\u201336 men's basketball team under Carlisle Cutchin. The 23\u20130 start was the third-best start in NCAA Division I history for a first-year head coach, and it set OVC records for most wins to start a season and overall winning streak during a season\nThe 10th win of the 2011\u201312 season was a victory over the then No. 21-ranked Memphis Tigers. This was Murray State's first win over a ranked team since defeating Vanderbilt in the 2010 NCAA tournament. It was also Murray State's first win over a ranked team during the regular season since the Racers defeated No. 12 Arkansas in 1997. Following the victory over Memphis, the Racers entered the national polls at No. 24 on the AP Top 25 Poll on December 12, 2011. This marked the first time an OVC basketball team had been ranked in the major national polls since the Racers were last ranked at No. 25 in the final poll of the 1998 season. The No. 24 ranking also marked the team's highest ranking since February 1971, when the Racers were 17th. The No. 24-ranked Racers defeated the Lipscomb Bisons in the 11th game of the season. The victory was the first win for Murray State as a ranked team since a ranked Racer team defeated Tennessee Tech 72\u201369 on February 2, 1971. On January 2, 2012, Murray State moved into the No. 1 spot in the CollegeInsider.com Mid-Major Top 25 Poll. The Racers became the first OVC team to ever achieve the No. 1 ranking in the Mid-Major Top 25 Poll. Following Murray State's 16th win of the season, a January 7, 2012, victory over conference-rival Austin Peay, the Racers moved up to No. 14 in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches' Poll and No. 15 in the AP Poll. Their 17th win came against Jacksonville State at the CFSB center to put the Racers to 17\u20130, and their best start in school history. Their 18th win against Tennessee Tech, 82\u201374 on January 14, 2012, kept Murray one of only three Division I schools with an unbeaten season as of that date. The January 9 AP ranking was the highest ranking in the history of the Murray State men's basketball program. The No. 15 ranking was also the highest ranking for an OVC team since the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers were ranked No. 7 on March 16, 1971.\nOn February 9, 2012, Murray State hosted OVC-rival Tennessee State University as the No. 9 team in the nation and the lone unbeaten in Division I basketball. Murray State lost 72\u201368. Two days later, Murray State answered with a definitive win at home against rival Austin Peay 82\u201363, bringing its record to 24\u20131. This win was quickly followed by a win on the road at SEMO, 75\u201366, to clinch the Racers third consecutive Ohio Valley Conference regular-season championship.\nOn February 18, Murray State hosted St. Mary's College in a much-anticipated Bracketbuster event, and the last home game of the season. The game was not only a sellout, but the largest ever for attendance at the CFSB center: 8,825. This marked the first time two ranked teams played at the CFSB Center  (Murray State No. 16 AP, No. 14 USA Today/ESPN; St. Mary's No. 21 AP, No. 16 USA Today/ESPN) and the first time a ranked Murray State team played another ranked team. The game also featured a national TV audience on ESPN with legendary announcers Dave O'Brien and Dick Vitale calling the action. Murray State never trailed in the game and defeated St. Mary's 65\u201351, improving its record to 26\u20131. As the historic 2011\u201312 season came to a close, the Murray State men's basketball program was the recipient of several high-profile awards. Coach Steve Prohm was named the Ohio Valley Conference Coach of the Year, which marked the third-consecutive year the award was presented to a Murray State head coach. Prohm also was recognized as the District-IV Coach of the Year by the United States Basketball Writers Association and District 19 Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Prohm also received two national coach of the year awards: the Basketball Times Coach of the Year Award and the Joe B. Hall National Coach of the Year Award. Junior point guard Isaiah Canaan was named OVC Player of the Year and Second Team All-America by the Associated Press, as well as selected to the John R. Wooden All-American team, Lute Olson All-America team, NABC All-America Third Team, and Sporting News All-America First Team. Canaan was a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award, Bob Cousy Award, Oscar Robertson Trophy, Lou Henson Award and to the Naismith College Player of the Year Midseason watch list.\nOn June 8, 2015, Prohm was announced as the new head coach at Iowa State. The Iowa State job had become open when Fred Hoiberg left to become head coach of the Chicago Bulls.\n\nMcMahon era (2015\u20132022)\nOn June 10, 2015, Matt McMahon was hired as head coach of Murray State. McMahon served as an assistant under Prohm and had just left the school to serve as an assistant to Eric Konkol at Louisiana Tech on May 27, 2015, before Prohm left for Iowa State. \"I am so excited to know that Coach McMahon will be returning to Murray State to lead the Racers,\" Murray State athletic director Allen Ward said. \"After watching him for four years, I'm convinced he's the right man for the job. He's an outstanding coach, nationally recognized as one of the top assistants in the country, with a tremendous upside. Matt has the talent and integrity to continue the momentum we've built, put his own stamp on the program, and meet the expectations that come with being the head coach at Murray State.\"\nIn his first season as head coach, the Racers finished the season 17\u201314, 10\u20136 in OVC play to finish in a tie for the West Division title. They lost in the quarterfinals of the OVC tournament. However, the following year, the team's record dipped as they finished 16\u201317, 8\u20138 in OVC play to finish in third place in the West Division and losing in the semifinals of the OVC tournament.\nMcMahon's third Racer team posted a 26\u20136, 16\u20132 record, winning the OVC regular season and tournament championships. They were received a 12 seed in the 2018 NCAA tournament, where they fell in the first round to West Virginia. After the season, he was named National Association of Basketball Coaches District 19 Coach of the Year.\nIn June 2018, Murray State awarded McMahon a contract extension through 2022.\nThe 2018\u201319 season saw the Racers win 15 of their first 17 games, with the only losses to Southeastern Conference opponents Alabama and eventual Final Four participant Auburn, both on the road. By then, the nation had been introduced to sophomore point guard Ja Morant, who scored 25 points against Auburn and 38 against Alabama. The Racers went on to post a 16\u20132 OVC record and won the conference tournament championship over Belmont, 77\u201365, in Evansville, Indiana, earning a bid to the NCAA tournament for the 17th time. There, the Racers earned a No. 12 seed and defeated Marquette of the Big East Conference, 83\u201364, in Hartford, Connecticut, on March 21 behind a triple-double from Morant (17 points, 11 rebounds, 16 assists). Two days later, Murray State fell to No. 4 seed Florida State of the Atlantic Coast Conference, 90\u201362, finishing the season with a 28\u20135 record. After the season, Morant was named a consensus First Team All-American after becoming the first player in NCAA history to average at least 20 points and 10 assists per game (24.5 ppg, 10 apg).\nThe 2019\u201320 season saw the Racers go 22\u20138 in the regular season and finish tied with Belmont atop the OVC standings with a record of 15\u20133. Murray State earned a share of its third straight regular season OVC Championship, while Belmont earned the No. 1 seed due to a tie-breaker (having a better record against EIU than the Racers did). Sophomores Tevin Brown and KJ Williams were named to the All-OVC First Team prior to entering the 2020 OVC Tournament. The Racers and Belmont squared off in the OVC Championship finale for the third time in the last three years. Murray State won the previous two years but fell this season, 76\u201375. There was no postseason play forthcoming for the Racers\u2014or anyone else in college basketball\u2014due to the shutdown of spectator sports due to the COVID-19 pandemic that engulfed the world in 2020.\nThe Racers' final OVC season in 2021\u201322 saw the Racers go on an unprecedented run rarely seen in the program's history. Initially picked to finish 3rd in the conference, the Racers compiled a perfect 18\u20130 record in conference play, winning the regular season title for the 28th time in program history. During this stretch, the Racers would enter the Top 25 rankings for the first time since the 2014\u201315 season, reaching as high as No. 19. In addition, Brown would break the OVC record for most 3-point field goals made in a career. They would then go on to win both of their OVC tournament games; a dominant semi-final victory over SEMO and a back-and-forth thriller against defending tournament champion Morehead State in the championship game, to secure the program's 18th OVC tournament championship and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Individually, Brown and Williams were once again named to the All-OVC First Team, being joined by sophomore Justice Hill. Williams was named OVC Player of the Year, while Hill was named the OVC tournament's Most Valuable Player. McMahon himself was named the OVC Coach of the year for his efforts. Earning a No. 7 seed, they defeated San Francisco in the first round of the NCAA tournament before a surprise loss to Saint Peter's in the second round. Two days after Murray's exit from the NCAA tournament, McMahon left to take the head coaching opening at LSU.\n\nSecond Prohm era (2022\u20132025)\nOn March 25, 2022, it was announced that Steve Prohm would return to the university as head coach. \"As we envisioned the ideal profile for the next Murray State Men's Basketball head coach, it remained abundantly clear a commitment to character, integrity, student-athlete development, community, family and competitive excellence were critically important,\" said Murray State Director of Athletics, Kevin Saal. \"Steve Prohm represents, reflects and personifies these, and many more, qualities. His skill set, experience and genuine love for Murray State will effectively guide our program as we begin our Missouri Valley Conference journey.\"\nOn March 7, 2025, after a loss in the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament quarterfinals, it was reported by ESPN that Murray State had parted ways with Prohm after a 45\u201352 record in three seasons as head coach. The university confirmed the decision the following day.\n\nSeason-by-season results\nStarting from the 1987\u201388 season, the Racers had recorded a winning season for 29 straight years ending in the 2016\u201317 season.  They have won 20 or more games in a season 32 times and three times have won 30 or more.  For the first time in school history, the 2014\u201315 Racers went undefeated (16\u20130) in the OVC regular season. In their final OVC season in 2021\u201322, they posted an unprecedented 18\u20130 OVC regular-season record.\n\nMsVC \u2013 Mississippi Valley Conference \nKIAC \u2013 Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (now known as River States Conference)\nSIAA \u2013 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association \nNAIB \u2013 National Association for Intercollegiate Basketball\nNAIA \u2013 National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (Was the NAIB until 1952, when it started sponsoring other sports) \nNIT \u2013 National Invitation Tournament \nNCAA \u2013 National Collegiate Athletic Association \nCIT \u2013 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament\n\nRankings\nThe Racers have been nationally ranked in eight seasons in either the Associated Press (AP) Poll or the ESPN-USA Today (Coaches) Poll.  They were first ranked during the 1950\u201351 season coached by Harlan Hodges.  The Racers received their highest ranking, under coach Steve Prohm, during the 2011\u201312 season, ranking 9th in the AP Poll and 7th in the Coaches Poll.\n\nThe AP Poll and Coaches Poll rankings represent the highest rankings received during that season.\n\nRivalries\nWestern Kentucky University\nMurray State's oldest basketball rivalry is with nearby Western Kentucky (WKU).  The two teams became archrivals during their time together in the Ohio Valley Conference.  Although the schools no longer share their conference affiliation (Western Kentucky joined the Sun Belt Conference in 1982 and Conference USA in 2014), the two schools keep the series alive every few years. The teams last played each other in 2014. They are set to renew their rivalry beginning in 2023 as part of a 4-game annual series. The two teams have met in basketball 147 times, with WKU leading the all-time series 95 to 56.\n\nAustin Peay State University (Battle of the Border)\nFor the rest of the Racers' OVC tenure, their primary in-conference rivalry was with Austin Peay State University, a school closer geographically than WKU. In February 2009, ESPN The Magazine highlighted the Austin Peay-Murray State rivalry. The men's basketball rivalry is part of the larger athletics rivalry between the two schools known as the Battle of the Border. While the schools no longer share their conference affiliation (both left the OVC in 2022, with Austin Peay joining the ASUN and Murray State joining the MVC), both teams have kept the series going. The two teams have met 135 times, with MSU leading the all-time series 90 to 45.\n\nBelmont University\nRecently, the Racers have been building a rivalry with Belmont University since the Bruins' entry into the OVC in 2012. From that year until both teams' departure from the OVC in 2022, Belmont and Murray State combined to win every regular season championship, including two seasons (2018\u201319 and 2019\u201320) where they shared the title. In three consecutive years (from 2018 to 2020), the Racers and Bruins met in the OVC Tournament finals, with Murray State winning in 2018 and 2019. With Belmont joining the MVC alongside Murray State, the rivalry will continue in that conference. The Bruins currently lead the all-time series 13 to 12.\nMurray has two more built-in regional rivals in the MVC, with Southern Illinois about two hours' drive away and Evansville slightly farther away (and also located in a county whose residents pay Kentucky in-state tuition at Murray State).\n\nCoaches\nThe Racers have had 17 different head coaches in their history.  Carlisle Cutchin has the most wins in school history with 267.  Steve Newton has won the most OVC Regular Season titles with four. Newton and Matt McMahon share the most OVC Tournament titles with three apiece.  Eleven different coaches have received the OVC Coach of the Year award for a combined 17 times.\n\nPlayers\nAll-Americans\nThe Racers have had 14 All-Americans; the first in 1938 and the most recent in 2019.\n\nNBA draftees\nThe Racers have had 25 players selected in the NBA draft, the first being Johnny Reagan by the Chicago Stags in 1948. Twice Murray State has had two players selected in the draft, in 1967 (Herb McPherson, San Diego [now Houston] Rockets, third round; Don Duncan, San Diego Rockets, 10th round) and 1971 (Hector Blondet, Portland Trail Blazers, fifth round; Ron Johnson, Baltimore Bullets [now Washington Wizards], ninth round). Here is a list of Racers picked in the draft that posted minutes in the NBA regular season:\n\nRetired numbers\nThe Racers have retired 14 numbers, the first in 1952 and the last in 2025.

    "biography": "The NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team represents North Carolina State University in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. NC State is one of the seven founding members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.  Prior to joining the ACC in 1954, the Wolfpack were members of the Southern Conference, where they won seven conference championships. As a member of the ACC, the Wolfpack has won 11 conference championships, as well as two national championships in 1974 and 1983.\nSince 1999, the Pack has played most of its home games at Lenovo Center, which is also where the NCAA championship trophies are kept. Prior to 1999, they played at Reynolds Coliseum.\n\nHistory\nNC State began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1911. In 105 years of play, the Wolfpack ranks 25th in total victories among NCAA Division I college basketball programs and 26th in winning percentage among programs that have competed at the Division I level for at least 26 years. The team's all-time record is 1782\u20131114 (.615).\nThe program saw its greatest success during the head coaching tenures of Everett Case (1946\u20131965), Norm Sloan (1967\u20131980), and Jim Valvano (1980\u20131990).\nNC State has produced some of the ACC's best players, including Tom Burleson, Rodney Monroe, Monte Towe, and Ron Shavlik. David Thompson, who led the Wolfpack to its first NCAA title in 1974, has been recognized as one of college basketball's greatest players.\n The Wolfpack has won a total of 18 conference tournament championships and 13 regular season conference titles. State has appeared in the NCAA tournament 29 times, with four Final Four appearances (1950, 1974, 1983, 2024) and two national titles (1974, 1983).  The Wolfpack also appeared in the Final Four of the 1947 National Invitational Tournament, which was during the NIT's \"national championship era.\"\nNC State achieved its 1,700th overall win against Presbyterian College, 86\u201368, becoming the 26th NCAA school to reach such an achievement.\n\nThe early years (1910\u20131945)\nIn 1910 Guy Bryan formed a special committee that proposed to the university administration the organization of the school's first basketball team. The program played its first official intercollegiate basketball game on February 16, 1911, against a much more experienced squad from Wake Forest. NC State, then known as the North Carolina A&M Farmers, lost, 33\u20136. The two teams met again five days later in Raleigh, with A&M earning its first-ever victory, 19\u201318. The following year, the school's athletics council officially recognized basketball as a sport.\nBefore the 1920\u201321 season the university changed its name from North Carolina A&M to North Carolina State College. At that time the school's nickname was the \"Tech.\" That season the program joined the fledgling Southern Conference as a charter member. State College changed its nickname yet again in 1923, this time to the \"Red Terrors.\" The name was drawn from a combination of the play of Rochelle \"Red\" Johnson and the team's new bright red road uniforms. Also in 1923, State opened its first basketball facility, Frank Thompson Gym. The gym, named in honor of a former athlete from the school who died in action during World War I, served as the team's home until 1948. During the first years of the program, the team had no practice facility and was forced to practice on an outdoor field in nearby Pullen Park.\nGus Tebell took over the basketball team as head coach in 1924. During his tenure he led the program to a number of school firsts, including the first conference championship in 1929 and the first 20-win season. He compiled a then all-time program best career coaching record at 79\u201336. The Wolfpack's first player to garner significant national recognition was Bud Rose, who, after the 1931\u201332 season, was named as an honorable mention All-American.\nIn 1941 the university began construction on William Neal Reynolds Coliseum, a multi-purpose arena that would serve as the new home of Wolfpack basketball. Construction was stalled due to the involvement of the United States in World War II, and the skeleton structure of the arena was left unfinished for nearly six years until its completion in 1949. The Wolfpack would play its home games at Reynolds for the next 50 years, until the men's team moved to PNC Arena in 1999.\n\nEverett Case era (1946\u20131965)\nFollowing the end of World War II, chancellor John W. Harrelson and athletic director H.A. Fisher set upon rebuilding the university's athletic teams. In 1946 David Clark, a former president of the NC State Alumni Association, suggested to the Athletics Council that the best place to search for a new head basketball coach would be in Indiana, which was a basketball hotbed at the time. Per Clark's suggestion, Harrelson and his father Stejem Mark met with Indiana native Chuck Taylor who was in Raleigh to coach his army team in an exhibition game against NC State. Taylor's recommendation for the job was his former high school coach Everett Case. When approached by Harrelson about the job, Case was at first hesitant because of the tight restrictions under which the program had been operating. Harrelson assured Case that he would be given an expanded budget and more than enough scholarships to field a competitive team. Additionally, Case was lured by the still unfinished Reynolds Coliseum. He accepted the job almost immediately without ever visiting the campus.\n\nSix consecutive Southern Conference titles\nEverett Case was named head coach on July 1, 1946. Case had previously coached high school basketball in Indiana, where in 23 seasons he compiled a 726\u201375 record and won four state championships at Frankfort High School. Before arriving at NC State, he spent two years as an assistant coach at the University of Southern California and spent several years coaching teams at various Naval bases during the war. In February 1947, his first season at NC State, Case defeated North Carolina in Chapel Hill, 48\u201346 in overtime, beginning a streak of 15 consecutive victories over the Tar Heels. Later that month, an afternoon game in Thompson Gym against Duke was postponed by city fire officials because of overcrowding. That evening the game was officially canceled after fans were found sneaking through bathroom windows, breaking down doors, and hiding in the basement. Less than three weeks later, Case guided the Red Terrors to their first Southern Conference championship in 18 years. Case and his team celebrated by performing an Indiana high school tradition of cutting down the nets. The tradition soon spread to college teams across the nation and survives amongst championship teams to this day. Soon after his arrival, Case was named \"Tar Heel of the Week\" by the Raleigh News and Observer, citing that \"since the little man came here from Indiana...basketball has almost supplanted politics as the favorite topic of discussion in the North Carolina capital.\" In Case's second season as head coach the team changed its nickname from the Red Terrors to the Wolfpack.\nIn February 1948, Case made alterations to the design of the still incomplete Reynolds Coliseum. Attempting to usurp Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium as the largest basketball arena in the area, Case insisted that the blueprints be changed to increase the maximum capacity from 9,000 seats to 12,400. Construction resumed later that month after a final shipment of steel arrived in Raleigh. Reynolds officially opened its doors on December 2, 1949, with a Wolfpack win over Washington & Lee, 67\u201347, in front of a crowd of 11,020. At that time, the arena was the largest college basketball facility in the southeast. Soon after Reynolds' opening, the Greensboro News & Record wrote that Raleigh had become \"the basketball capital of the world. Immediately, at once.\"\n\nLater that month, December 28\u201330, the first annual Dixie Classic tournament was held in Reynolds. The Dixie Classic was a three-day tournament held each December until 1961 that matched the four Tobacco Road schools of NC State, North Carolina, Duke, and Wake Forest against four of the top teams from across the country. In its time the Dixie Classic became the largest regular season tournament in college basketball. After finishing the season at 27\u20136 and winning its fourth consecutive Southern Conference tournament, the Wolfpack received invitations to both the National Invitation Tournament and the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Case declined the NIT bid and accepted the invitation to the program's first ever NCAA Tournament. The team defeated Holy Cross before losing to eventual champion City College of New York, 78\u201373. NC State went on to defeat Baylor in the third-place game, 53\u201341. The Wolfpack won its fifth consecutive Southern Conference title in 1951 and its sixth the following year. Both seasons ended in early exits from the NCAA Tournament, though. In 1951 State defeated Villanova in the first round before losing to Illinois. In 1952 the team lost in the first round to St. John's and future North Carolina head coach Frank McGuire.\nThe Wolfpack's six-year winning streak against North Carolina came to an end in January 1953, as the Wolfpack, ranked #17 in the country, lost to the unranked Tar Heels in Raleigh, 70\u201369. It was the first match between the two schools since the hiring of Frank \"the man\" McGuire the previous summer. McGuire inflamed NC State players and fans by having his players cut down the nets in Reynolds Coliseum following the victory. Despite the loss, the Pack finished first in the conference at 13\u20133 but lost in the conference tournament championship game. The team was ranked 18th in the final AP poll of 1953 but was left out of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four years.\n\nThe move to the ACC\nBy the end of the 1952\u201353 season the Southern Conference had bloated to 17 members and was still seen as a football-centric conference. Maryland and Duke had become national football powers and there weren't many schools in the conference that could regularly compete against them. In an effort to create a more balanced round-robin schedule and thus secure an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, the top eight football schools from the conference\u2014Maryland, Duke, UNC, Virginia, South Carolina, Clemson, Wake Forest, and NC State\u2014left to form the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nNC State's first ACC contest was on the road against Wake Forest in December 1953. The Wolfpack was ranked #8 in the nation at the time, but just as in the first ever meeting between the two schools, Wake Forest prevailed. Case and his squad defeated the Demon Deacons later that season in the first-ever ACC Tournament championship game, 82\u201380 in overtime. The victory meant a return trip to the NCAA tournament, where NC State defeated George Washington in the first round before losing to eventual champion La Salle in the second round. Case's squad won a second ACC title the following year, defeating Duke in 87\u201377 in the championship game. The team finished with a 28\u20134 record but was ineligible for postseason play; earlier in the season the NCAA imposed four years' probation and banned them from postseason play during that time for numerous recruiting violations. The Wolfpack brought home a third consecutive ACC title in the 1955\u201356 season, setting a record for consecutive ACC championships that stood until 2002. The team also played in its first televised game earlier that season, losing to North Carolina in Chapel Hill, 73\u201369. State struggled in the 1956\u201357 season, finishing fifth in the conference for the first time under Case.  State's loss in the first round of that year's ACC tournament also marked the first time that Case did not lead his team to the conference championship game. To add insult to injury, bitter rival North Carolina brought the ACC its first national championship.  The team finished third in 1958 and was ranked 20th in the nation at the season's end but again lost early in the ACC tournament, this time to North Carolina in the quarterfinals.\nThe 1958 Dixie Classic brought to Reynolds Coliseum some of the most talented teams ever assembled for the tournament. Included in the field were eight players who eventually earned All-American honors, including NC State's Lou Pucillo and John Richter, North Carolina's Lee Shaffer, York Larese, and Doug Moe, Cincinnati's Oscar Robertson, Michigan State's Johnny Green, and Louisville's Don Goldstein. Later that season, NC State, ranked #10 in the nation, defeated North Carolina, ranked #5, 80\u201356 to win their fourth ACC championship in six seasons.  However, due to the 1956 sanctions, they were ineligible for the NCAA Tournament. The Pack finished the season ranked #6 with a 22\u20134 record.\n\nCase's final years\nThe 1959\u201360 Wolfpack team finished with an 11\u201315 record, marking Case's first losing season in Raleigh. The team finished fourth in the ACC in 1961 and third in 1962 but lost in the first round of the conference tournament both seasons. In the summer of 1962, Case, then 62 years old, hired his former player and then Clemson head coach Press Maravich to be his top assistant. Case's health began to deteriorate rapidly over the following two seasons as the Wolfpack finished fifth in the ACC in 1963 and seventh in 1964. The seventh-place finish was the lowest of Case's tenure and would prove to be his last. On December 7, 1964, just two games into the season, Everett Case retired and named Maravich as his successor. During his tenure, Case won six Southern Conference titles, four ACC titles, and qualified for the NCAA Tournament twice. His overall record of 377\u2013134 remains the best in NC State history.\nMaravich led the Pack to second-place finish in the conference and an ACC championship, its first in six years. After State defeated eighth-ranked Duke in the championship game, 91\u201385, Case, by then using a wheelchair, was rolled on court to cut the final strand from the net. Maravich had originally been hired in part because of his son Pete Maravich, who at the time was a highly touted high school player. After Pete failed to qualify academically at NC State, he accepted a scholarship to play at LSU. After the 1965\u201366 season, Press Maravich resigned as head coach of the Wolfpack to follow Pete to LSU. NC state finished eighth in the ACC in Maravich's final year. On April 30, 1966, the day after Maravich announced that he was leaving, Everett Case died while in a Raleigh hospital.\n\nNorm Sloan era (1967\u20131980)\nJust a week after Maravich's exit, former Wolfpack basketball and football player Norm Sloan was hired as the new head coach. In 1967\u201368, his first season, Sloan's team finished the regular season third in the ACC with a 9\u20135 conference record. State made it as far as the ACC championship game before losing to North Carolina 87\u201350, but it was the Pack's semifinal game against tenth-ranked Duke that is most remembered. Sloan realized that his team was vastly undersized against the Blue Devils. He decided, however, to use the Wolfpack's quickness to its advantage and keep the ball away from the Duke players for as much of the game as possible. Using a tactic he coined \"stall-ball,\" Sloan instructed his players to hold the ball at halfcourt and slow the game down as much as possible. The final result was the lowest scoring game in ACC Tournament history. Duke led 4\u20132 at halftime and the Wolfpack held the ball for more than 13 straight minutes in the second half. In the end, State prevailed 12\u201310.\nThe following season marked another historic first in the Wolfpack program, as on December 2, 1968, Al Heartley debuted as the school's first African-American basketball player. Heartly had a solid three-year career at NC State and was named a team captain as a senior.\n\nNC State won Sloan's first ACC title, and sixth overall, in Sloan's third season, 1969\u201370. The team finished the regular season at 23\u20137 overall and third in the conference. In the conference championship game, the Pack defeated third-ranked South Carolina 42\u201339 in double overtime. With the victory, the Wolfpack was invited to its first NCAA Tournament in five years. State received a bye in the first round of the tournament and lost its first game to St. Bonaventure in the semifinals, 80\u201368. In the Eastern Regional third-place game, the Pack defeated Niagara, 108\u201388. Despite State's quick exit from the tournament, Sloan's squad finished the season ranked tenth in the AP poll, its first end-of-the-season ranking since being ranked sixth following the 1958\u201359 season.\nDuring the spring of 1970, just after the season's end, Sloan signed Tom Burleson. Burleson, a 7'4\" native of Newland, NC, was the first major player of the Wolfpack squad that would have a combined record of 57\u20131 during the 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374 seasons to be signed. The following spring, Sloan signed the remaining pieces of the 1974 championship nucleus, 6'4\" David Thompson, 5'7\" point guard Monte Towe, and 6'7\" power forward Tim Stoddard. At the time, the NCAA prohibited freshmen from competing on varsity squads and the team struggled in the following two seasons, finishing seventh in the ACC in 1970\u201371 and fifth in 1971\u201372. At 13\u201314 overall, the 1970\u201371 season was Sloan's worst and his only losing season as the Wolfpack head coach.\nWith the addition of Thompson, Towe, and Stoddard to the starting lineup in 1972\u201373, the team rebounded quickly from its recent struggles. David Thompson, later known as \"Skywalker\" for his 44-inch vertical leap, impressed in his 1972 debut as a sophomore. In what was a 130\u201353 rout of Appalachian State, Thompson scored 33 points and collected 13 rebounds. On January 14, 1973, NC State played in the first nationally televised Super Bowl Sunday college basketball matchup. The third-ranked Wolfpack defeated second-ranked Maryland in College Park, 87\u201385. The two teams met again two months later in the ACC Tournament championship game. State won another narrow victory over the Terrapins, 76\u201374, to finish the season at a perfect 27\u20130. However, due to NCAA sanctions resulting from violations during Thompson's recruiting, the team was barred from postseason participation.\n\n1974 National Championship\nThe NCAA sanctions against the Wolfpack were lifted after the 1972\u201373 season. Ranked second nationally in the first AP poll of the season, the team was poised to make another strong run. State began the season with a pair of games against East Carolina and Vermont, which it won by a combined score of 176\u201387. The third game of the season was against seven-time defending national champions UCLA and coach John Wooden. The Pack came out sluggish and was easily defeated, 84\u201366. It would prove to be the team's only loss in two seasons, though, as the Pack tore through the ACC, finishing the regular season at 24\u20131 overall. As the team continued to rack up victories, its national ranking rose accordingly. On February 19, with just four regular season games remaining, NC State overtook UCLA for the top spot in the AP poll; it was the program's first ever #1 ranking.\nAs the top seed in the conference tournament, the Wolfpack received a bye in the first round. In the semifinals State easily defeated Virginia, 87\u201366. In the championship game the team faced off against fourth-ranked Maryland, which had lost by only six points in each of the teams' regular season meetings. Maryland jumped to an early 25\u201312 lead, hitting 12 of its first 14 shots. The Wolfpack cut the deficit to five points at halftime, but momentum shifted throughout the second half. NC State led by four late in the game, but Maryland closed the gap and sent the game to overtime, tied at 97. The Wolfpack, led by Tom Burleson's 38 points, won 103\u2013100 in what has been heralded as one of the greatest college basketball games ever played.\nBack in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four seasons, Sloan and his team played their first two games on their home court. They defeated their first two opponents, Providence and Pittsburgh, by a combined 32 points to set up a Final Four rematch with UCLA. In the week leading up to the game, thousands of fans packed Reynolds Coliseum to watch the Wolfpack practice. When the two teams finally met in Greensboro, it was another tight contest for the Pack. After ending regulation tied at 65, each team scored only two points in the first overtime. UCLA took a seven-point lead in the second extra period, but NC State led by David Thompson, took the lead for the final time with 34 seconds to play. State went on to win, 80\u201377, and advanced to the national championship game against Marquette.\nThe championship game, played two nights later, was much less competitive than the previous contest. The game was close in the first half until Marquette coach Al McGuire received two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. McGuire's exit sparked a 10\u20130 Wolfpack run just before halftime. NC State led by as much as 19 points in the second half and ultimately won, 76\u201364.\nThompson left NC State after his senior season in 1975 as the school's most decorated player. He won every major national player of the year award in 1975, in addition to being a three-time consensus First-Team All-America honoree, a three-time unanimous First-Team All-ACC honoree, and a three-time ACC Player of the Year winner. In his 86 games, Thompson scored 2,309 points (26.8 ppg); he still holds the Wolfpack records for points scored in a single season (838 in 1974\u201375) and points scored in a single game (57 in 1974). His #44 jersey remains the only retired jersey in NC State history, though others have been honored. In early 2024, a statue of Thompson was placed outside Reynolds Coliseum.\nSloan remained head coach through the 1979\u201380 season. His last team (1979\u201380) team reached the NCAA Tournament, losing to Iowa in the second round. Also, twice during his final six seasons in Raleigh his teams played in the NIT. In 1976, the Pack advanced to the semifinals and in 1978, it defeated South Carolina, Detroit, and Georgetown before falling to Texas in the championship game. In his final season, he led the program to its 1000th victory. After resigning from NC State, Sloan returned to Florida, where he had previously coached from 1961 to 1965.\n\nJim Valvano era (1980\u20131990)\nFollowing Sloan's exit, Jim Valvano was hired as head coach on March 27, 1980. Valvano had previously coached at Iona, where he compiled a 94\u201347 record over five seasons. Valvano's teams saw incremental improvement in his first two seasons, finishing seventh in the ACC in 1981 and fourth in 1982.\n\n1983 National Championship\nExpectations were high before the 1982\u201383 season, but a foot injury to Dereck Whittenburg slowed the team to a fourth place regular season finish. Whittenburg returned to the court in time for the ACC tournament, which most believed the Pack needed to win in order to secure a second consecutive berth in the NCAA Tournament. State did just that, defeating heavily favored North Carolina and Virginia squads led by Michael Jordan and Ralph Sampson, respectively. The Wolfpack kept winning. Their close games and exciting finishes in the ACC Tournament and early rounds of the NCAA tournament earned them the moniker The Cardiac Pack.  As a #6 seed in the NCAA tournament, the Wolfpack won narrow victories over Pepperdine (in double overtime) and UNLV (71\u201370) before defeating Utah in the Sweet Sixteen, 75\u201356. In the regional final, NC State again defeated Virginia, 63\u201362, then defeated Georgia in the Final Four to advance to the championship game against Houston. The Cougars, nicknamed Phi Slama Jama for their athletic, fast-paced style of play that featured Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon, were expected to win easily over the underdog Wolfpack. NC State escaped with their second national title after a last-second air ball by Dereck Whittenburg was caught and dunked by Lorenzo Charles. The 54\u201352 final is one of the most famous in college basketball history.[1]\nValvano's 1984 team finished 7th in the ACC and lost in the first round of the NIT to future conference foe Florida State. The following season, with the addition of guard Vinny Del Negro, the Pack began a run of five consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. The Pack reached the Elite Eight in 1985 and 1986 and the Sweet Sixteen in 1989. In 1987, after a sixth-place finish in the regular season, NC State made another surprising run through the ACC tournament. In the championship game, State defeated rival North Carolina, which had gone undefeated in conference play. State finished second in the conference the following year and was a #3 seed in the NCAA tournament. The team made an early exit, though, losing to #14 seed Murray State in the first round.\nValvano's final season in Raleigh was mired in controversy after the release of the book, Personal Fouls, written by Peter Golenbock. In the book, Golenbock alleged improper practices and a lack of institutional control in the NC State athletics department. The allegations included grade fixing, lowered or waived entrance requirements for athletes, the selling of tickets and sneakers by athletes, and frequent drug use by athletes. The claims were refuted by Valvano and Chancellor Bruce Poulton, claiming that some of the players might have sold some of their shoes, most notably to ACC superfan Jason Bass. The NCAA investigation, and 5 additional investigations by separate entities found only that players indeed sold shoes and their complimentary game tickets for spending money. Nonetheless, the NCAA banned NC State from postseason play for the 1989-90 season. Earlier, NC State limited itself to only 12 total scholarships for 1990\u201391 and 1991\u201392. Although Valvano was not named in the NCAA report at all, new chancellor Larry Monteith forced his resignation on April 7, 1990.\n\nLes Robinson era (1990\u20131996)\nTo replace Valvano, NC State turned to East Tennessee State coach Les Robinson, who had played for Case in the 1960s. Robinson was the 1991 District Coach of the Year as selected by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) after leading NC State to a 20\u201311 record in the first season.  He was the first first-year coach in ACC history to win 20 games, post a winning regular season conference record, and win games in both the ACC and NCAA Tournaments.  The only other coach to pull off this feat is North Carolina's Bill Guthridge.\nHowever, the lost scholarships took their full effect a year later, and the Wolfpack plummeted into the ACC's second division for the next five years. The low point of Robinson's tenure at his alma mater came during the 1992\u201393 season. Due to injuries and academic-related suspensions, Robinson was only able to dress seven players for most conference games.  They ultimately finished 8\u201319, the worst record in modern Wolfpack history.\nIn 1992 the ACC Tournament was expanded because of the addition of Florida State. A play-in game between the eighth and ninth place teams was created, and during his five years as the N.C. State coach after its addition, Robinson's Wolfpack played in the play-in game four out of five times (finishing seventh in 1992). Because of his team's traditional appearance in the Thursday night play-in game, the game became known as the \"Les Robinson Invitational\" by ACC fans. The play-in game was discontinued when the ACC expanded to include Miami and Virginia Tech, and required three Thursday games. With the later addition of Boston College, there are now four games on Thursday.\nLes Robinson would stay on as head coach through the 1995\u201396 season.  While he never tallied another winning record, his stint went a long way towards cleansing the image of the program to both insiders and outsiders. Robinson was appointed NC State's athletic director in 1996 and stepped down as head coach. He left to become The Citadel's athletic director in 2000.\n\nHerb Sendek era (1996\u20132006)\nSendek was hired at NC State in 1996 after three years of success at Miami (Ohio), his first head coaching experience. He immediately improved upon the Les Robinson era, winning 17 games for the program's first winning record in six years. In his first year at NC State, the Wolfpack also finished the year winning eight of 11 games, advanced to the finals of the ACC Tournament, and earned a trip to the postseason in the NIT.\nSendek coached NC State to the NCAA tournament five consecutive years from 2002 until 2006 (tying the school record). He had his most success during these last five years, winning his 100th game at NC State in 2002 and having a winning conference record in each year but one. In 2004, Sendek won ACC Coach of the Year and Julius Hodge, one of Sendek's most prized recruits during his NC State tenure, won the ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In 2005, NC State upset defending champion Connecticut in the second round of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, NC State's deepest run into the tournament during Sendek's years. Sendek finished his NC State coaching career with a 71\u201388 record in the ACC and a 32\u201387 record against RPI top 50 teams.  On April 3, 2006, Sendek accepted the head coaching job at Arizona State.\n\nSidney Lowe era (2006\u20132011)\nSidney Lowe was named head coach in May 2006 after a month-long search that included such targets as Rick Barnes, John Beilein, John Calipari, and Steve Lavin. Lowe's first season got off to a good start as the Wolfpack won its first five games. State's first three ACC contests were losses, however, and the team finished the regular season at 15\u201314, tenth place in the ACC at 5\u201311. Despite depth issues, the squad made a surprising run to the ACC Tournament championship game in Tampa, winning three games in three days before losing to North Carolina, 89\u201380. The Wolfpack was given a berth in the NIT, its first since 2000. There the Pack defeated Drexel on the road and Marist in Reynolds Coliseum before losing in the third round at West Virginia. After the season, Lowe was rewarded with a contract extension lasting through the 2012\u201313 season, but after a disappointing 2010\u201311 season, Lowe resigned his position as NC State's coach.\nLowe was revered for his role as starting point guard on the \"Cardiac Pack\" team that won the 1983 NCAA championship. He returned to Raleigh in 2006 to replace Herb Sendek as coach, but the Wolfpack struggled to sustain any momentum in Lowe's five seasons. Although he made the NIT twice, he never made the NCAA tournament as a coach, and never finished higher than ninth place in the ACC. He went 86\u201378, including just 25\u201355 in ACC play. Lowe was 3\u201316 record against rivals Duke and North Carolina, with two of those wins coming in his first year.\n\nMark Gottfried era (2011\u20132017)\nMark Gottfried was named head coach on April 5, 2011. In his first season as head coach of NC State, Mark Gottfried recorded a 22\u201312 overall regular season record, including a 9\u20137 regular season record in the ACC, and reached the semifinals of the ACC tournament. Mark Gottfried recorded the second best season by a first-year coach at State, second only to Everett Case. Gottfried's first Wolfpack team earned a #11 seed in the 2012 NCAA Tournament. The Pack won in the tournament over sixth seeded San Diego State and third seeded Georgetown to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where it lost to second seeded Kansas. They finished the season ranked #20 in the AP Poll.\nEntering the 2012\u201313 season, expectations ran high for Gottfried's second season as head coach. The Wolfpack returned four starters from its 2012 Sweet Sixteen squad and were joined by a trio of talented freshman, each of whom were selected as McDonald's All Americans. As a result, NC State started the season ranked #6 in the AP preseason poll, the Wolfpack's second-highest preseason ranking in program history. Additionally, NC State was voted as preseason favorite to win the ACC title in the conference's annual media survey and the inaugural league coaches\u2019 poll. Ultimately, the team did not live up to media expectations. 24\u201311 overall, The Wolfpack finished tied for fourth in the ACC regular season standings with a 24\u201311 overall record (11\u20137 ACC) and as a #8 seed lost its first game in the second round of the 2013 NCAA tournament to Temple.\nMark Gottfried began his third season as head coach of the Wolfpack having lost five of seven players who logged significant minutes (four of which were starters). They struggled for most of the season, finishing 9\u20139 in ACC play. However, the Wolfpack surprised many by making the semifinals of the ACC tournament by upsetting #11 Syracuse, who entered the tournament as a second seed. They eventually lost to a third seeded Duke team. They were selected as a #12 seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament, where they won over Xavier in the First Four before losing in the second round to St. Louis. They finished the season 22\u201314.\nComing into Gottfried's fourth season, NC State had lost T. J. Warren, the ACC's leading scorer the previous year, to the NBA draft. They also lost point guard Tyler Lewis, who transferred to Butler. They finished 19\u201312 with a 10\u20138 ACC record. NC State upset Jahlil Okafor and #2 Duke on January 11, nearly two years after upsetting them in the same place in 2013. They also upset #15 UNC in the Dean Smith Center for the first time since 2003, holding the Heels to their lowest home point total ever. These two wins, along with wins against Louisville and Syracuse made Gottfried the first coach to beat all ACC Hall of Fame coaches in the same year. They made it to the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament where they lost to Duke, and were selected as an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament where they made the Sweet Sixteen, upsetting #1 Villanova along the way.\nIn Gottfried's fifth season, NC State lost half of its scoring threat with Trevor Lacey declaring for the draft and Ralston Turner and Desmond Lee graduating. Additionally, Kyle Washington transferred to the Cincinnati. NC State suffered a loss in their opening game against William & Mary, and highly touted guard Terry Henderson suffered an ankle injury in the first 10 minutes, which resulted in him sitting out for the rest of the season. This was the beginning of a long and painful season for the Pack. NC State struggled to compete in the ACC after going 10\u20133 out of conference. Junior point guard, Cat Barber finished the season as the ACC's leading scorer, averaging 23.5 points per game and making the All-ACC first team. After a tough loss to Duke in the second round of the ACC Tournament, NC State finished the season 16\u201317 and 5\u201313 in the ACC, making it Gottfried's worst season to date. The Wolfpack decided to not participate in any post-season tournaments.\nExpectations ran high for Gottfried's sixth season as head coach, with a highly touted recruiting class and several key players returning such as Abdul-Malik Abu and BeeJay Anya. It was later announced that he would be fired at the end of the season.\n\nKevin Keatts era (2017\u20132025)\nOn March 17, 2017, Kevin Keatts was named the head basketball coach at NC State. \nIn 2024, the Wolfpack ended the regular season 17-14 but won the ACC Tournament for the first time since 1987. The team was only the second to win their conference championship by winning five games in five days since Connecticut did so in the Big East Tournament during their 2011 national championship season. Seeded 11th in the NCAA Tournament's South Region, the Wolfpack reached the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2015 after an upset of Texas Tech and an overtime win over Oakland. They then made their first Elite Eight appearance since 1986 after upsetting second seed Marquette and then their first Final Four appearance since 1983 after beating Duke for the second time in March 76\u201364. The women's team, coached by Wes Moore, made the Final Four a few hours earlier on the same day by beating top seed Texas in the Elite Eight in Portland, marking the first season in which the school's men's and women's teams both made the Final Four.\nThe success of the Wolfpack's 2024 NCAA tournament run was short-lived. The team finished 2025 with a 12\u201319 record, including a 5\u201315 mark in the ACC. Keatts was fired at the end of the season.\n\nWill Wade era (2025\u2013Present)\nOn March 23, 2025, Will Wade was named the head basketball coach at NC State.\n\nSeasons\nResults by season (1980\u20132025)\n\u2020NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Wolfpack have appeared in the NCAA tournament 29 times.

    "biography": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball team competes as part of NCAA Division I, representing the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference. Since it was founded in 1897, the program has appeared in eight NCAA Division I tournaments and twenty other national postseason tournaments. Nebraska has played its home games at Pinnacle Bank Arena since 2013.\nPrior to the creation of the NCAA tournament, Nebraska was a Midwest power under head coaches Raymond G. Clapp and Ewald O. Stiehm. NU struggled through the post-World War II years, which included a stretch of twenty-eight years with just two winning seasons that stretched into the 1960s. Much of the team's modest modern-day success came during the fourteen-year tenure of Danny Nee, Nebraska's winningest head coach. Nee led the Cornhuskers to five of their eight NCAA Division I tournament appearances and won the 1996 NIT championship. Nebraska has reached the NCAA tournament just twice since Nee was fired in 2000, but won a second postseason title in 2025, the inaugural College Basketball Crown. The team has been coached by Fred Hoiberg since 2019.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe University of Nebraska's basketball history began on February 2, 1897, six years after the invention of the sport by James Naismith. The Nebraska \"Bugeaters\" defeated a team from the Lincoln YMCA 11\u20138 at Grant Memorial Hall, which was located on the site of the current Sheldon Museum of Art and served as NU's primary home venue until the NU Coliseum opened in 1926. Nebraska began playing other universities in 1898\u201399, defeating Nebraska Wesleyan and Doane, and faced an out-of-state opponent for the first time the following season, beating Naismith and Kansas 48\u20138 in what is still the worst loss in KU history. NU's 1899\u201300 team finished 5\u20130 and was retroactively ranked second nationally by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\nMulti-sport coach Raymond G. Clapp took over the basketball program in 1903 and led NU into the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association after playing its first eleven seasons as an independent. In its early years, the MVIAA divided teams into North and South divisions \u2013 Nebraska won six of seven North division championships, the first two under Clapp. During this stretch, Wilbur Wood became the second black player at a predominantly white university in men's college basketball history.\nIn 1911, fiery football coach Ewald O. Stiehm became the school's first full-time basketball coach. Stiehm \u2013 nicknamed \"Jumbo\" because of his large feet \u2013 won fourteen of fifteen games in his first season; The Daily Nebraskan blamed the only loss on Nebraska's inability to adjust to Minnesota's larger court. Under Stiehm and his high-pace offensive scheme, Nebraska won or shared the MVIAA championship in 1912, 1913, and 1914, and guard Sam Carrier became Nebraska's only first-team All-America selection. Stiehm had verbally agreed to remain at Nebraska until at least 1917, but given the successes of the entire athletic department, asked the Athletic Board for a raise in 1916. The board refused and declined an offer from local businesses to help pay the additional salary, and Stiehm agreed to take over Indiana's athletic department at an annual salary of $4,500.\nStiehm's abrupt departure meant the university was forced to turn to graduate student Samuel C. Waugh, who led NU to a 13\u20131 finish and a fourth MVIAA title in his lone season as head coach. In 1916, football coach E. J. Stewart was asked to lead the basketball program as well. Stewart advocated scheduling difficult opposition across all sports as the best way to \"add to Nebraska prestige around the United States.\" NU's run of conference success ended under Stewart, who left the university after an abbreviated 1917\u201318 season to assist the YMCA during World War I. He returned and coached one more season before departing permanently. Football assistant Paul J. Schissler succeeded Stewart and immediately led NU to a twenty-two-win season, a school record that stood until 1991. Nebraska declined an invited to the postseason AAU tournament in Atlanta. Schissler resigned to become head football coach at Lombard College following the 1920\u201321 season, later coaching the National Football League's Chicago Cardinals and Brooklyn Dodgers and helping create the league's Pro Bowl.\n\nNebraska played its 1921 and 1922 home games at the State Fairgrounds Coliseum while Grant Hall was being remodeled. The Fairgrounds Coliseum had a larger court and higher seating capacity than Grant Hall. After two seasons, NU returned to Grant Hall and played there until 1926, when construction on the $445,000 NU Coliseum was finished. The Coliseum's seating capacity of 8,000 nearly quadrupled that of Grant Hall. The Cornhuskers lost 25\u201314 to Kansas in the first game at their new home on February 6, 1926.\nAfter ending the decade with an 11\u20135 season under former Kansas All-American Charles T. Black, Nebraska had just two winning seasons over the following nineteen years, one of which was a Big Six championship in 1937. The 1930s produced four more Cornhusker All-Americans: Don Maclay in 1931, Steve Hokuf in 1933, George Wahlquist in 1936, and Robert Parsons in 1937. Maclay was the Big Six's scoring leader in 1930, scoring 112 points in ten league games.\n\nHarry Good (1946\u20131954)\nHarry Good was hired as head coach in 1946, and after two losing seasons he turned Nebraska's fortunes around. In 1948\u201349, Good's Huskers went 16\u201310, tied Oklahoma for the Big Seven championship and defeated the Sooners in a conference playoff to qualify for an NCAA berth. The Cornhuskers lost 52\u201335 to MVC champion Oklahoma A&M 52\u201335, which finished runner-up to Adolph Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats. In 1949\u201350, Nebraska again won sixteen games and shared the Big Seven title with Kansas and Kansas State, NU's most recent regular season conference championship. Claude Retherford and Bus Whitehead were named all-conference performers in 1949, and Whitehead earned the honor again the next year. The 6-ft 11-in. Whitehead averaged a then-school-record 15.7 points per game in 1950 and was the first Cornhusker selected to play in the East-West All-Star Game at Madison Square Garden. When he graduated, Whitehead held nine school scoring records. This period of relative prosperity was followed with fifteen consecutive losing seasons. Despite playing for a team that finished last in the Big Seven, Husker guard Jim Buchanan earned All-America and all-conference honors in 1952.\n\nJerry Bush (1954\u20131963)\nJerry Bush, dubbed the \"Big Bear of the Coliseum,\" never produced a winning team in his nine seasons at Nebraska, and never finished higher than fourth in conference play. Nevertheless, his colorful personality and uncanny ability to fashion upsets kept Cornhuskers fans entertained. The most dramatic of these upsets came against No. 4 Kansas in 1958. The Jayhawks defeated the Cornhuskers 102\u201346 earlier in the year, with star center Wilt Chamberlain single-handedly matching Nebraska's forty-six points. In the rematch, guard Jim Kubacki hit a jump shot with two seconds remaining to give Nebraska a 43\u201341 win. Kubacki started the game out with a knee injury, but when team captain Gary Reimers hurt his leg with seven minutes remaining, Kubacki convinced Bush to let him suit up.\nBush coached the school's first 1,000-point scorer, Indianapolis native Herschell Turner, who was rated the second-best high school player in the state as a senior, behind only Oscar Robertson. Turner earned All-America honors in 1959 and followed with All-Big Eight honors in 1960 and ended his collegiate career with 1,056 points.\n\nJoe Cipriano (1963\u20131980)\nIn March 1963, Bush was replaced as head coach by thirty-one-year-old Joe Cipriano. Nebraska athletic director Tippy Dye had coached Cipriano at Washington, where they led the Huskies to the 1953 Final Four and a 79\u201315 record during the energetic Cipriano's varsity career. Following graduation, he served as an assistant coach at his alma mater until he was hired by Idaho in 1960. His Vandals improved in each of his three seasons and posted a 20\u20136 record in 1962\u201363, led by future Basketball Hall of Famer Gus Johnson. \"Slippery Joe\" brought an up-tempo style of basketball to the Coliseum; his Nebraska teams ran a full-court press and fast-break offense, which led the Big Eight in scoring average in 1966, 1967, and 1968.\n\nCipriano's first two teams struggled to a combined record of 17\u201333. But his third team, in 1965\u201366, was one of the most successful in school history, finishing 20\u20135 and second to Kansas in the Big Eight. However, that was not enough to garner a postseason bid, as only the conference champion was guaranteed a berth in the twenty-two-team NCAA tournament.\nThe 1966\u201367 team finished 16\u20139 and made the school's first postseason appearance, in the fourteen-team NIT at Madison Square Garden. Guard Stu Lantz, a two-time All-Big Eight selection, led the Cornhuskers in scoring and rebounding in both 1966\u201367 and 1967\u201368. Guard Marvin Stewart and center Chuck Jura earned All-Big Eight honors in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Guard Jerry Fort, who finished his career with a then-school record 1,882 points, was the first Nebraska player chosen first-team all-conference three times. Led by Cipriano and Fort, Nebraska began a string of fourteen consecutive winning seasons.\nIn the fall of 1976, NU basketball moved out of the Coliseum and into the state-of the-art NU Sports Complex (now the Bob Devaney Sports Center), located on the State Fairgrounds. The $13 million athletic complex was financed by a special cigarette tax.\nCipriano coached Nebraska to another twenty-victory season in 1977\u201378. The Cornhuskers, led by All-Big Eight guard Brian Banks, finished 22\u20138 and advanced to the second round of the NIT. By the 1979\u201380 season, Cipriano's failing health \u2013 he would die of cancer in November 1980 \u2013 meant he had to share coaching duties with assistant Moe Iba, and they took Nebraska to the NIT again. The duo were named co-recipients of Big Eight Coach of the Year.\nCipriano brought Nebraska into the modern era, coaching seventeen seasons and 450 games. His record of 253\u2013197 gave him nearly one-fifth of Nebraska's all-time wins, and 168 more than any previous NU head coach.\n\nMoe Iba (1980\u20131986)\nIba was named head coach following Cipriano's death in November 1980. In Iba's six seasons, Nebraska was 106\u201371 and advanced to postseason play four times.\nCenter Andre Smith was the 1981 Big Eight Player of the Year and twice earned all-conference honors. However, it was Jack Moore, a 5-ft 10-in. playmaker from Muncie, Indiana, who captured the hearts of Nebraska fans in the early 1980s. Moore earned All-Big Eight honors in 1982, when he won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award as the nation's top player six feet tall or shorter. Moore scored 1,204 points, shot .901 from the free throw line during his career, and was NU's first three-time academic All-Big Eight selection.\nThe cornerstone of Iba's teams from 1983 through 1986 was Omaha native Dave Hoppen, a three-time All-Big Eight center and the first Nebraska basketball player to have his jersey number (No. 42) retired by the school. In 1982\u201383, Hoppen's freshman season, the Cornhuskers went 22\u201310 and won three games in the NIT before losing to DePaul in the semifinals. The Cornhuskers returned to the NIT each of the next two seasons, advancing to the second round both times.\nHoppen's college career was ended by a knee injury he sustained against Colorado on February 1, 1986. He finished as the school's all-time scoring leader with 2,167 points and broke or tied nineteen school records. Despite Hoppen's injury, Iba's team earned the school's first NCAA Tournament berth, where they lost to Western Kentucky 67\u201359 in the first round of the Southeast Regional. Before the tournament began, Iba became aware athletic director Bob Devaney was reaching out to coaches across to gauge their interest in Nebraska's coaching position. He resigned following the game.\n\nDanny Nee (1986\u20132000)\nOn March 27, 1986, Danny Nee was introduced as Nebraska's twenty-fourth basketball coach. During his introductory press conference, Nee said a \"new era\" in NU basketball was beginning. Nee's fourteen teams appeared in the postseason eleven times and topped the twenty-win mark in seven seasons. In his first season, Nebraska was 21\u201312 and finished third in the NIT. Nebraska missed postseason play in each of the following three seasons, but won a school-record twenty-six games in 1990\u201391. The Cornhuskers reached the Big Eight Tournament championship game for the first time and advanced to the NCAA Tournament, where they were upset by No. 14 seed Xavier in the first round. The 1990\u201391 team included two future first-round NBA draft picks, senior Rich King and redshirt freshman Eric Piatkowski. The 7-ft 2-in. King was the tallest player in program history. Piatkowski, Nebraska's sixth man in 1990\u201391, went on to earn first-team all-conference honors twice. He ranks second on the Cornhuskers' career scoring list with 1,934 points and is the only Nebraska player to finish with at least 1,900 points, 600 rebounds (669) and 300 assists (322). In 2006, Piatkowski (No. 52) joined Hoppen and Stu Lantz (No. 22) as the only players to have their number retired.\nThree more NCAA Tournament appearances followed the record-breaking 1991 season. In 1992\u201393, the Huskers tied for second place in the Big Eight, their highest league finish under Nee. In addition to reaching a fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament and recording back-to-back twenty-win seasons for the first time in school history, Nee's 1993\u201394 team won the school's first conference tournament title. The Cornhuskers defeated Oklahoma, Missouri, and Oklahoma State to win the Big Eight Tournament.\nNebraska's NCAA Tournament run ended at four in 1994\u201395, but the Cornhuskers kept their postseason streak alive with an NIT berth, advancing to the second round. The 1995\u201396 team again failed to reach the NCAA Tournament, but capped its season with a run to the NIT title. NU won two games on the road and scored more than eighty points in four of their five postseason games, finishing with a 60\u201356 victory over St. Joseph's. The 1996 NIT championship team was one of the most talented in school history. Two future NBA players, Erick Strickland and 1998 first-round draft pick Tyronn Lue, started in the backcourt. Two others scored 1,000 career points, Jaron Boone and freshman Venson Hamilton, who finished his career in 1999 as the school's all-time leading rebounder and shot-blocker. Lue, a six-foot point guard, finished his career as the seventh-leading scorer in school history, and ranked in the top ten in twelve other categories. He led the Cornhuskers to the 1997 NIT in Nebraska's first season in the Big 12 Conference.\nBehind Nebraska's longest conference winning streak in twenty years, Nee's twelfth team at NU finished fourth in the Big 12 and returned to the NCAA Tournament. The bid was the Cornhuskers' fifth during the 1990s and extended a school-record postseason streak to eight years. The streak reached nine in 1999 when Big 12 Player of the Year Venson Hamilton led the Cornhuskers to the second round of the NIT. The 1999\u20132000 season quickly fell apart when guard Cookie Belcher was sidelined by a wrist injury; the team finished 11\u201319 and tied the school record for losses in a season. Nee was fired just days after a 69\u201364 win over Colorado made him the winningest coach in school history.\n\nBarry Collier (2000\u20132006)\nDirector of Athletics Bill Byrne hired Barry Collier as the Cornhuskers' new coach on April 5, 2000. In Collier's first season, Nebraska finished 14\u201316 as Belcher returned to the lineup and earned second-team All-Big 12 honors. He finished his career with 353 steals, the third-most in NCAA history. In Collier's fourth season, Nebraska finished 18\u201313 and earned its first postseason bid in five years. Nebraska won its first two games in the 2004 NIT, including a thrilling 71\u201370 road victory over in-state rival Creighton in the opening round. NU nearly overcame a seventeen-point halftime deficit in the third round, but lost to Hawaii by one point.\nDespite a lackluster season for the program, freshman center Aleks Mari\u0107, the first Australian to play in the program, broke the NU freshman record for rebounds and double-doubles. He finished his four-year career fifth all-time in scoring and was only the second Husker to record 1,000 career rebounds. NU rebounded to finish 19\u201314 and make its second postseason appearance in three years in 2006, the program's most wins under Collier and the first time his Huskers won a Big 12 Tournament game. NU reached the semifinals of the conference tournament for the first time since winning the Big Eight Tournament in 1994. Collier abruptly resigned in August of 2006 to become the athletic director at his alma mater Butler, ending his career at Nebraska with an 89\u201391 record.\n\nDoc Sadler (2006\u20132012)\nThe late job opening created by Collier's abrupt resignation was filled in just one week, when Doc Sadler was introduced as the twenty-sixth head coach in program history. Sadler's program saw limited success through his six seasons in Lincoln, finishing above .500 four times but winning only one postseason game and failing to reach the NCAA Tournament.\nNebraska led the Big 12 in scoring defense in Sadler's second season, allowing just 60.7 points per game. NU led the Big 12 again the following season and ranked just outside the top twenty nationally at 60.4 points against per game, the second-lowest total for NU since 1951. This allowed NU to reach .500 in conference play for the first time in ten seasons. Despite typically lackluster offensive performances, Sadler's strong defenses earned him eighty-nine victories through his first five seasons in Lincoln, the highest total in school history. He was the second NU coach to reach the postseason twice in his first three seasons and the second since World War II with three winning seasons in his first four years. Led by another strong defensive unit that ranked seventh nationally in field goal percentage against (.389), NU defeated three ranked teams during the 2010\u201311 season, reaching the NIT to mark the school's third postseason appearance in four seasons under Sadler.\n\nThe University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln joined the Big Ten Conference in 2011 and later that year the school opened the Hendricks Training Complex, a basketball training and practice facility attached to the Devaney Center. After a disappointing 12\u201318 season in 2011\u201312, athletic director Tom Osborne fired Sadler after six seasons. At the press conference to address his firing, an emotional Sadler addressed the media: \"I wanted to be the guy that won the first NCAA Tournament game. It didn\u2019t happen. That's the bottom line. We can all sit here and talk about this that whatever. It all comes down to winning. That's what it should come down to.\"\n\nTim Miles (2012\u20132019)\nTim Miles was hired as Nebraska's head basketball coach on March 24, 2012 after a five-year stint at Colorado State. In his second season, the Cornhuskers moved to Pinnacle Bank Arena after thirty-seven years at the Devaney Center. Their first game in the new arena was an exhibition game against Nebraska-Kearney on November 4, 2013, followed four days later by their first regular season game against Florida Gulf Coast. Behind a 15\u20131 record at \"The Vault,\" Miles led the Cornhuskers to the program's first NCAA Tournament berth since 1998, but NU lost to Baylor in the first round. Despite appearing in the preseason AP Poll for the first time in twenty years, Nebraska finished under .500 in 2014\u201315 and did not have a winning record again until 2017\u201318. On February 6, 2017, Nebraska suffered their worst home defeat in program history, closing the regular season with a thirty-six-point loss to Michigan. After two NIT appearances in the following seasons, Miles was fired on March 26, 2019.\n\nFred Hoiberg (2019\u2013present)\nOn March 30, 2019, the University of Nebraska announced that Fred Hoiberg had been hired as its head coach. NU lost at least twenty games in each of Hoiberg's first three seasons, the first such seasons in program history. The 2022\u201323 season looked to be the same until the Huskers won 5 of their 7 final games to finish 16\u201316. The positive momentum carried into the 2023\u201324 season where NU finished 3rd in the Big Ten and earned an 8 seed in the NCAA Tournament. A first-round loss to Texas A&M ended the season, but the team still finished with the second-best record in program history at 23\u201311.\nHoiberg has produced 2 current NBA players in his tenure at Nebraska, Dalano Banton and Bryce McGowens.\n\nSeasons\nConference affiliations\nIndependent (1896\u20131907, 1919\u20131920)\nMissouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association / Big Eight Conference (1907\u20131919, 1920\u20131996)\nBig 12 Conference (1996\u20132011)\nBig Ten Conference (2011\u2013present)\n\nCoaches\nCoaching history\nCoaching staff\nRivalries\nNebraska and Creighton first met March 3, 1923, a 46\u201324 Bluejays win in Omaha. The schools, located fifty miles apart, played infrequently until beginning an annual series in 1977. Nebraska won sixteen of twenty matchups throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but Dana Altman and successor Greg McDermott revived the Bluejays program and took control of the series. NU has won both postseason meetings, in the 1984 and 2004 NIT. Creighton leads the series 30\u201328.\nSince Creighton has not had a football program since 1942, a number of CU basketball fans also support Nebraska's football team. These are often derisively referred to as \"Jayskers,\" a portmanteau of \"Bluejays\" and \"Cornhuskers.\"\n\nVenues\nNU Coliseum\nNebraska spent its earliest seasons at Grant Memorial Hall, a converted armory built in 1887. Aside from two years at the Fairgrounds Coliseum while Grant Hall was being renovated, NU played at the venue until 1926.\nThe university broke ground on the NU Coliseum in 1924, adjacent to the recently completed Memorial Stadium. Initially intended to be a part of the stadium complex, the Coliseum was funded as a standalone project using gate receipts from 1923 football games. It was designed by architects Ellery L. Davis and Walter Wilson, both university alumni who had worked on several buildings around NU's campus, including Memorial Stadium. Upon its completion in 1926, the Coliseum hosted most of the university's indoor athletic events.\nThe first event at the arena was a 25\u201314 men's basketball loss to Kansas on February 6, 1926. The program was generally unsuccessful in its fifty years playing at the Coliseum, though a nine-day stretch in 1958 featured two of the most memorable games in school history, wins over Wilt Chamberlain-led Kansas and top-ranked Kansas State at the Coliseum.\n\nBob Devaney Sports Center\nNebraska opened the 13,595-seat NU Sports Complex in 1976, a $13-million project financed by a local cigarette tax, and moved both its men's and women's basketball teams to the arena. It was renamed in honor of College Football Hall of Fame head coach Bob Devaney two years later and played home to Nebraska basketball for nearly four decades.\nNebraska played its most successful years in program history at the Devaney Center under Danny Nee in the early 1990s. Nee took NU to four consecutive NCAA Division I tournaments, upsetting several highly-ranked teams at the Devaney Center during his tenure. The Cornhuskers never had a losing season at the arena, compiling an overall record of 477\u2013148. Nebraska moved to Pinnacle Bank Arena in 2013 but still practices at the Hendricks Training Complex at the Devaney Center.\n\nPinnacle Bank Arena\nNebraska moved to West Haymarket Arena (known as Pinnacle Bank Arena for sponsorship purposes) in 2013. Construction of the $181-million venue in Lincoln's Haymarket District was funded primarily through an occupation tax on restaurants, bars and hotels. It has a listed capacity of 15,000 for men's basketball games, making it the second-largest arena in the state of Nebraska and fifth-largest in the Big Ten Conference.\nNU went 15\u20131 in its inaugural season at what became known as \"The Vault,\" including a late-season victory over Wisconsin that propelled the program to its first NCAA Division I tournament since 1998. Ten years later, Nebraska defeated No. 1 Purdue at Pinnacle Bank Arena, its first victory over the country's top-ranked team in forty-two years. The program has ranked in the national top twenty-five in attendance each year it has played at the arena.\n\nChampionships and awards\nConference championships\nRegular season\n\nMVIAA / Big Eight: 1912, 1913, 1914, 1916, 1937, 1949, 1950\nTournament\n\nBig Eight: 1994\n\nIndividual awards\nJim Phelan Award: Tim Miles (2014), Fred Hoiberg (2024)\nConference player of the year: Andre Smith (1981), Venson Hamilton (1999)\nConference freshman of the year: Erick Strickland (1993)\nConference coach of the year: Joe Cipriano (1966, 1978, 1980), Moe Iba (1981), Danny Nee (1991), Tim Miles (2014), Fred Hoiberg (2024)\n\nFirst-team All-Americans\nSam Carrier \u2013 1912\u201313\n\nRetired numbers\nPostseason results\nNCAA Division I tournament\nNebraska has appeared in eight NCAA Division I tournaments with a record of 0\u20138.

Much of the team's modest modern-day success came during the fourteen-year tenure of Danny Nee, Nebraska's winningest head coach. Nee led the Cornhuskers to five of their eight NCAA Division I tournament appearances and won the 1996 NIT championship. Nebraska has reached the NCAA tournament just twice since Nee was fired in 2000, but won a second postseason title in 2025, the inaugural College Basketball Crown.

  "New Mexico Lobos": {
    "biography": "The New Mexico Lobos men's basketball team represents the University of New Mexico, competing in the Mountain West Conference (MWC) in NCAA Division I. The university established basketball as a varsity sport in 1899 and began competing with regional colleges after establishing an athletics department in 1920.\nLobo basketball first achieved national prominence after Bob King was hired as head coach in 1962. King transformed a moribund program into a consistent winner and produced future ABA MVP Mel Daniels. The Lobos won the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) championship in 1964 and 1968, making frequent appearances in national rankings. The team reached the NIT tournament final in 1964 and received its first bid to the NCAA tournament in 1968. The success of the program continued after King departed, winning WAC titles in 1974, 1978, and 1994, winning the conference tournament in 1993 and 1996, and regularly earning post-season tournament bids.\nThe Lobos became frequent participants in the NCAA tournament during the 1990s and have made 16 appearances overall, as well as 20 NIT appearances. They have won the MWC regular season championship and the conference tournament five times each. In addition to Daniels, other prominent players produced by the Lobo program include five-time NBA champion Michael Cooper, three-time NBA champion Luc Longley, NBA all-star Danny Granger, and Kenny Thomas.\nThe most renowned enduring feature of the Lobo basketball program is its home venue, known as \"The Pit\", recognized as one of the best college basketball arenas in the country. The Pit opened in 1966 and the Lobos have been dominant playing there, winning over 80 percent of their games, while regularly placing among national leaders in attendance. The arena has frequently hosted NCAA tournament games, including the 1983 NCAA Final Four that featured one of the most memorable finishes in tournament history.\n\nHistory\nRoy W. Johnson (1920\u20131960)\nRoy Johnson, nicknamed \"Old Iron Head\", was fundamental to the early development of Lobo athletics. Johnson arrived in 1920 after a successful athletic career at the University of Michigan. The UNM gymnasium at the time was a small wooden building where the walls were out-of-bounds markers for basketball games. Basketball was primarily an intramural sport, with occasional games against other schools, including Albuquerque High School, and no regular schedule. Johnson set about building collegiate-level athletics facilities, performing some of the hard labor with his own hands. He oversaw construction of Carlisle Gymnasium in 1928 and Zimmerman Field in 1938, the first football stadium at UNM.\nDuring his nearly 40 years at UNM, Johnson coached every men's sport the school offered, while teaching physical education. A decorated veteran who served in World Wars I and II, he was the UNM athletic director from 1920 to 1949. He established regularly scheduled games against regional colleges, and in 1931 UNM joined the Border Conference as a founding member. Johnson coached the UNM basketball team for all but two seasons from 1920 to 1940. From 1924 to 1934, his teams posted a 104\u201338 (.732) record. The Lobos won 165 games with Johnson as head basketball coach, a school record for over 30 years and currently third on its all-time list.\nJohnson stepped down as head basketball coach after the 1939\u201340 season. The position passed to a few different coaches before Woody Clements took over 1944\u201351 and 1953\u201355, compiling a record of 113\u2013119 (.487). The Lobos won the Border Conference in 1944 and 1945, and they appeared in the NAIA post-season tournament in 1947, losing to Hamline University in the first round. From 1951 to 1962, the Lobos competed in the Mountain States Conference, known at the time as the Skyline Eight. In 1957, while still on faculty, Johnson oversaw construction of the 7,800-seat arena that bears his name, Johnson Gymnasium. For many years, Johnson Gym was the most prominent feature of the UNM campus for those driving along Central Avenue in Albuquerque, part of historic U.S. Route 66.\n\nBob King (1962\u20131972)\nLobo basketball first achieved national prominence under Bob King, who was previously an assistant coach at his alma mater, the University of Iowa. The Lobos had only two winning seasons from 1947 to 1962, compiling a 113\u2013252 (.310) record, including a dismal 42\u2013149 (.220) during the last eight years. King had an immediate impact on the program. The Lobos won as many games in his first two seasons as in the previous seven combined and went 116\u201344 (.725) over his first six seasons. They went 175\u201389 (.663) in ten seasons with King as head coach, winning two conference titles and making four appearances in post-season tournaments.\nNew Mexico joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) as a founding member before King's first season. His first team went 16\u20139, the best Lobo record in 17 years. The following season, 1963\u201364, the Lobos won their first WAC championship, led by Ira Harge, who King had recruited from a junior college in Iowa. The team posted wins over Kansas and at Purdue and received a berth in the 1964 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The Lobos defeated Drake and NYU before falling to Bradley in the championship game, finishing with a 23\u20136 record and ranked 16th in the UPI poll. Harge averaged 18.8 points and 11.8 rebounds a game during his two seasons at UNM and was selected in the second round of the 1964 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nThe rise of the program continued in the 1964\u201365 season, led by sophomores Mel Daniels and Ben Monroe. After an early loss at Kansas, the Lobos won ten straight, later building a 19\u20133 record and attaining a #10 national ranking, their first appearance in the AP poll. They dropped their next four games on the road, however, including a one-point loss at #10 BYU. They were again invited to the NIT, where they lost to St. John's to finish 19\u20138. Daniels averaged over 17 points and 11 rebounds a game, providing the fast-growing Lobo fan base a preview of things to come. Due to the success of King's first three seasons, attendance at Johnson Gym more than doubled, and plans to build a larger arena began to take shape. In the 1965\u201366 season, Daniels averaged 21 points and 10 rebounds a game, and the Lobos raced out to an 11\u20131 record after beating #7 BYU. They faltered down the stretch though and finished 16\u20138, completing the team's best four-year stretch in nearly forty seasons.\nUniversity Arena opened as the home venue of the Lobos on December 1, 1966. Because the playing surface is 37 feet below grade, students nicknamed the arena \"The Pit,\" and the nickname stuck. The team began the 1966\u201367 season ranked 6th in the country and rose to #5 before winning at #2 UTEP, the defending national champion and highest-ranked team New Mexico had ever beaten at that point. The Lobos reached #3 with an 11\u20131 record but then lost four straight and fell out of the rankings. Despite a disappointing WAC campaign, they received a bid to the NIT. The Lobos beat Syracuse in the first round before losing to Rutgers, finishing the season 19\u20138 and ranked #18 in the UPI. Daniels averaged 21.5 points and 11.6 rebounds a game, finishing his career with a still-team record 44 double-doubles, and he became the first Lobo to be named as an All-American. He was selected as the ninth pick overall in the 1967 NBA draft by the Cincinnati Royals, but he chose to play in the fledgling American Basketball Association (ABA), becoming one of its greatest all-time players. He was named the first ABA Rookie of the Year in 1968, ABA Most Valuable Player in 1969 and 1971, and he led the Indiana Pacers to three ABA championships.\nStoking the popularity of Lobo basketball by this time was the success of two longtime rivals. New Mexico began playing New Mexico State in 1904, currently totaling over 200 games; they first played UTEP in 1929, with over 140 games total. Don Haskins took over at UTEP in 1961 and led the Miners to a 128\u201332 (.800) record in his first six seasons, including a 28\u20131 national championship season in 1965\u201366. New Mexico State hired Lou Henson as head coach in 1966, and like the Lobos under King, in his second season the Aggies began achieving national rankings and post-season tournament appearances. They went 74\u201314 (.841) from 1967 to 1970, including a 27\u20133 season in 1969\u201370 in which they were ranked in the top five most of the year, culminating in a Final Four appearance. The Lobos, Aggies, and Miners played one another twice every season, home-and-away, and a fierce rivalry grew among them. The teams were frequently ranked in national polls, giving their games a showdown quality extending beyond local bragging rights to the national stage.\n\nThe Lobos lost Daniels and Monroe to graduation and were picked in the 1967\u201368 preseason to finish last in the WAC. Instead, they started the season 17\u20130, rising to #6 before beating #5 Utah in the Pit, propelling the Lobos to #4. Four starters averaged in double-figures in scoring, led by senior guard Ron Nelson at 19.5 points a game. They swept their regular season match-ups against New Mexico State, with both teams ranked in the top ten at the time of their second game. The Lobos won the WAC championship, Nelson was named a Helms All-American, and the Lobos earned their first NCAA tournament appearance. They entered the tournament 23\u20133 and ranked #6. They hosted their first-round game in The Pit but lost to unranked Santa Clara. Starting center Greg \"Stretch\" Howard was ineligible due to an NCAA rule disallowing transfers to play in postseason games; without his 14 points and 10 rebounds a game, the Lobos' balanced attack withered, and Nelson was their only consistent offense. Also playing in the first round at The Pit, New Mexico State lost to eventual champion UCLA, then won the consolation game over the Lobos, who finished the season 23\u20135.\nThe 1968\u201369 season began with high expectations and the Lobos ranked in the top ten, but they dropped out after a string of road losses. Howard led a young team, scoring 19.7 per game, with sophomores Willie Long and Petie Gibson beginning their runs as three-year starters. The Lobos swept #8 New Mexico State, with Gibson hitting a memorable last-second shot in the latter game, leading to a brief return to the national rankings. The team finished the season 17\u20139 but failed to receive an NIT berth. The Lobos slumped to a 42\u201336 record over the next three seasons. Long averaged 23.9 points a game both his junior and senior seasons, earning all-WAC honors both seasons and all-American recognition in 1971. He finished with career averages of 19.8 points and 10.2 rebounds per game, and his 23 double-doubles in 1969\u201370 still stands as the Lobo season record. Gibson compiled career averages of over 11 points and seven assists per game, still holding UNM records for career assists per game and four other assists categories.\nAfter the 1971\u201372 season, assistant coach Norm Ellenberger was elevated to head coach, and King served as Assistant Athletics Director the next season. King then left to become head coach and Athletics Director at Indiana State University. In 1976, he recruited future Hall of Famer Larry Bird to ISU, where he led the Sycamores to a 48\u201312 record in his first two seasons. King suffered a heart attack and brain aneurysm shortly before Bird's senior season, however, and his assistant, Bill Hodges, led the team to the 1979 Final Four, where they lost to Michigan State in the championship game. King continued as AD until retiring the next year.\nBob King transformed the New Mexico program, becoming known as the \"Architect of Lobo Basketball.\" Since his arrival at UNM, the Lobos have won over sixty percent of their games and earned over thirty berths to post-season tournaments, while suffering only five losing seasons. In 1992, UNM announced that the basketball court at University Arena would be named in honor of King. \"Bob King Court\" was dedicated at formal ceremonies on December 1, 1992, the 26th anniversary of the opening of The Pit. Coach King died on December 10, 2004.\n\nNorm Ellenberger (1972\u20131979)\nUnder Norm Ellenberger, the Lobos won WAC championships in 1974 and 1978 and compiled an overall record of 134\u201362 (.684). Ellenberger was named head coach in March 1972 after serving as an assistant under King since 1967. It was Ellenberger's first Division I head coaching position, but he made up for what he lacked in experience with energy and enthusiasm. The program thrived, and Ellenberger became a local celebrity, restaurateur, and man-about-town, earning the nickname \"Stormin' Norman\" for his flashy attire and fiery coaching style.\n\nLike King, Ellenberger got off to a fast start in his first two seasons. In 1972\u201373, the Lobos raced out to a 9\u20130 record, including road wins at Oregon State and eventual Southwest Conference champion Texas Tech, leading to their first appearance in the national rankings in nearly four years. The team was led by the strong inside scoring and rebounding of Darryl Minniefield, Bernard Hardin, and Mark Saiers. In late February the Lobos were 21\u20133, ranked #15, and leading the WAC, before losing their last two games and finishing second in conference. The Lobos returned to the NIT, losing to eventual champion Virginia Tech and finishing 21\u20136.\nThe 1973\u201374 Lobos began the season 12\u20130, launching them to a #8 ranking. Hardin led the way, averaging 17 points a game, and the team became the highest scoring Lobo squad to date at over 84 points a game. Bill Hagins replaced Minniefield, and the team was again dominant inside. After a string of road losses, the Lobos recovered to win six of seven and secure the WAC championship in a strong season for the league when five of eight teams were ranked at some point. The Lobos earned their second trip to the NCAA tournament and tallied their first tournament victory, downing Idaho State before losing to San Francisco in the second round. They beat Dayton in the regional consolation game to finish the season 22\u20137 and ranked #18 in the UPI. Attendance at The Pit surged to its best ever, a trend that would continue throughout the Ellenberger years, regularly earning placement among the top five in the nation. The top six largest crowds ever at The Pit were during this period.\nThe 1974\u201375 Lobo team was depleted by graduation and slipped to a 13\u201313 record. Ellenberger began relying heavily on recruiting Junior College (JC) transfers, a tactic that would lead to his best season as Lobo coach but later to his downfall. The 1975\u201376 team improved to 16\u201311 with a largely mercenary squad of JC transfers who would later quit the team before the end of the season. A memorable highlight of the season was the first game in a brief but intense rivalry with UNLV before the teams were in the same conference. Ellenberger was well-respected as a teacher of defense, and he was a frequent participant in basketball coaching camps and workshops, where he became friends with UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian. In January 1976, #4 UNLV survived a scare from the underdog Lobos before a Pit-record crowd of 19,452, with fans overflowing onto the concourse and sitting in the stairways, a game still lauded as one of the greatest and loudest ever in The Pit.\nThe 1976\u201377 team featured JC arrivals Michael Cooper, Marvin Johnson, and Willie Howard, the nucleus for a successful and exciting two-year run. Cooper is among the best overall players ever produced by the Lobo program and was named an All-American in 1978. He averaged 16 points and five rebounds a game as a Lobo, also leading the team in assists and steals. \"Coop\" later became a mainstay of the \"Showtime\" Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s, winning five NBA championships over a 12-year career. His defensive prowess made him an eight-time recipient of NBA All-Defensive Team honors, as well as the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1987. By contrast, Marvin \"Automatic\" Johnson was one of the greatest scorers in Lobo history. He became the fourth leading scorer in school history at the time in just two seasons, set single season records for total points, season points per game (24.0), career points per game (21.9), and he scored a still-school record 50 points in a single game. Willie Howard was a talented inside player averaging 13 points and six rebounds a game, frequently providing explosive scoring off the bench. Further JC transfers Jimmy Allen and Will Smiley completed a strong Lobo front line. The injection of talent made the Lobos exciting and competitive, but they took time to gel as a team, beginning the season 6\u20134 with a couple of disappointing losses. They beat Iowa and USC on the way to another showdown with #9 UNLV, losing a high-scoring game, then losing to #10 Arizona. The Lobos remained in the WAC race late in the season, but road struggles relegated them to third place and a 19\u201311 final record.\nBefore the 1977\u201378 season, Ellenberger installed what he called the \"Equal Opportunity Motion Offense\", a run-and-gun attack emphasizing picks and passing as players rotate through each position, taking advantage of his versatile, athletic lineup. The scheme also employed a full-court pressing, trapping defense to generate points off of turnovers. The team played at a frenetic pace and led the nation in scoring at 97.5 points per game. Phil Abney and Russell Saunders were JC additions; Abney initially backed up Howard but later moved into the starting line-up. The Lobos stood at 7\u20132 after losing to #10 Syracuse, then rattled off 14 straight wins, including a home-and-away sweep of #9 UNLV, pushing them into the national rankings and eventually into the top ten. Attendance at The Pit jumped to over 17,000 a game, second most in the nation, as fan enthusiasm soared. The Lobos won their fourth WAC championship with a 13\u20131 league record, losing only at ranked Utah, and entered the NCAA tournament ranked #5 and seeded second in the West Regional, with the opportunity to play in The Pit for the regional final with a win. They were upset in the first round by unranked Cal State Fullerton, however, in another disappointing tournament performance. The Lobos finished the season 24\u20134 and ranked #12, and Ellenberger was voted runner-up for the US Basketball Writers Coach of the Year award.\nThe 1978\u201379 Lobo squad returned starters Abney and Saunders while adding another strong JC class including Larry Belin. The team began the season 8\u20133 but struggled away from The Pit, losing its first seven road games. The team finally broke through, winning another exciting game at UNLV, beginning a string of nine wins in its last ten games. The strong finish earned the Lobos an NIT bid, where they lost to Texas A&M, finishing the season 19\u201310. The 1979\u201380 roster appeared once again loaded with talent, and fan expectations were again high, but disaster struck the program in the early weeks of the season as the \"Lobogate\" scandal unfolded. Leading players like Belin lost eligibility and were dropped from the team. Ellenberger was fired on December 17, 1979, and the season continued with the remaining players not caught up in the scandal, along with several walk-ons.\n\nLobogate\nThe \"Lobogate\" scandal involved forged academic transcripts, payments made for bogus Junior College credits, and other devices to attain eligibility for players who lacked academic credentials. In an investigation into illegal gambling, the FBI had placed a wiretap on the phone of a major Lobo booster. While Ellenberger was visiting this booster, in November 1979, he took a call on the tapped phone from assistant coach Manny Goldstein. They discussed an arrangement to transfer bogus credits from a California Junior College to the office of the UNM registrar. Based on this conversation, the FBI launched an investigation that led to a federal indictment of Ellenberger on seven counts of fraud and forgery of academic transcripts, though he was acquitted of those charges at trial. In July 1981, however, he was convicted by a state District Court on 21 of 22 counts of fraud and submitting false public vouchers. The judge deferred sentence for a year, noting that it was unfair for Ellenberger alone to bear culpability, and all counts were formally dismissed in 1983.\nThe NCAA investigation into the scandal found 34 violations of recruiting rules, and the Lobo program was placed on probation and banned from post-season appearances for three years. Six players were dismissed from the team in the opening weeks of the 1979\u201380 season, and another was suspended. The damage to the program was devastating, as it was forced to rebuild virtually from scratch, beginning in mid-season.\nWhile the criminal charges were cleared from Ellenberger's record, he would never be a college head coach again. Despite the scandal, Ellenberger managed to remain popular in Albuquerque, running a nightclub, appearing in TV commercials, and coaching the city's Continental Basketball Association team \u2013 some fans even wanted him to be rehired as Lobo coach. In 1986, former rival and longtime friend Don Haskins hired Ellenberger as his lead assistant at UTEP, where he would coach for four years. He then became the lead assistant for Bobby Knight at Indiana for ten seasons, from 1990 to 2000, and later coached in the NBA and WNBA.\n\nCharlie Harrison (1979\u20131980)\nWhen Ellenberger was fired in December 1979, lead assistant Charlie Harrison was elevated to head coach for the remainder of the season. Only four scholarship players remained on the team, so a campus tryout filled out the roster with walk-ons. The team limped to a 6\u201322 record. One stand-out was Kenny Page, a transfer from Ohio State. Page was the only consistent offensive threat on the team, averaging 28 points a game, still the Lobo record for best season average. Harrison and his players gained fan appreciation for persevering under difficult circumstances, but he served primarily as a caretaker until a new head coach was named.\n\nGary Colson (1980\u20131988)\nGary Colson rebuilt the Lobo program virtually from scratch after Lobogate, restoring its integrity and eventually its success on the court. Colson inherited a program under NCAA sanctions, with only three players remaining on scholarship. While he initially relied on JC transfers to fill the roster, he also began the slow process of rebuilding the program around freshmen recruits, with a greater emphasis on academics. Colson adhered strictly to NCAA rules, as UNM officials watched the program closely, wary of falling back into disfavor with the NCAA. Colson later stated that he felt tremendous pressure to push the rules, and knew other coaches who were doing so and succeeding, but his personal integrity kept him from doing so, an attitude appreciated by his players.\nIn their first three seasons under Colson, the Lobos struggled to a 39\u201344 combined record. Four-year starting PG Phil Smith led those early teams, averaging 14 points, six assists, and two steals per game over his career, setting then-records for highest scoring freshman, most steals in a season, and most career assists. A highlight of Colson's first season was his fourth game as head coach, hosting an Arizona State team that would reach #3 in the nation led by future NBA players Byron Scott, Fat Lever, Alton Lister, and Sam Williams. The callow Lobo squad led for much of the game, encouraged by a delirious crowd at The Pit. The Sun Devils battled back to tie the game at the end of regulation before escaping with a win in OT, 86\u201383. Despite the struggles of the team, attendance at The Pit actually improved in Colson's early years, remaining in the top four nationally.\nThe 1983\u201384 Lobos relied almost exclusively on four senior starters, led by Smith and Tim Garrett, to the point that they took over the top four positions in school history for minutes played in a season. The Lobos opened the season with two losses before beating USC and Washington and winning at #7 UCLA. The plucky squad lacked depth, but its veterans found ways to win, building a 16\u20134 record. The team frequently slowed their games to a crawl, with several league games ending with both teams scoring under 50 points, such as a win at Wyoming, 40\u201338. The Lobos averaged 63.7 ppg, their lowest output since 1958\u201359, while holding opponents to 59.2 ppg, the lowest since Bob King's early years. Top ten-ranked UTEP foiled the Lobos, however, sweeping their regular season match-ups and knocking them out of the WAC tournament. Smith was named All-WAC, and Colson was named WAC Coach of the Year. The Lobos returned to the NIT, losing at The Pit to Lamar and finishing the season 24\u201311. The NIT appearance began a streak of eleven straight years of reaching post-season play.\nThe Lobos in 1984\u201385 were led by JC transfer forward Johnny Brown (18.8 points and 6.3 rebounds per game) and senior center George Scott (14 points and 6.6 rebounds), along with a nucleus of sophomores, including guards Hunter Greene and Kelvin Scarborough, who both scored in double figures. The Lobos beat a good Arizona team before losing a close game to #1 Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, the first time the Lobos had faced a top-ranked opponent. The team slipped to 6\u20135 before winning eight out of nine, gaining a share of the WAC lead. They then lost five of six to finish in a tie for third. They beat Texas A&M in the NIT before losing at Fresno State to finish the season 19\u201313. Brown again led the Lobos in 1985\u201386 with 20.9 points and 7.5 rebounds a game, earning All-WAC recognition. Scott was lost to graduation, Greene sat out the season injured, and the inexperienced team struggled badly on the road. They nevertheless reached the NIT, losing to Texas and finishing 17\u201314.\nThe 1986\u201387 season was the most successful for Colson as Lobo coach. Greene returned to average 21 points and six rebounds a game, while Scarborough added 19 points and six assists. The Lobos scored over eighty points a game and set the team record for most total points in a season. They also established still-standing records for steals in a season as a team, Greene for steals by a player in a season, and Scarborough for career steals. The Lobos logged wins over Texas and Oklahoma State on the way to a 17\u20135 record. They then lost three league road games and fell to third in a tight WAC race. The Lobos reached the final of the WAC tournament but lost to Wyoming, which went on to reach the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament. At 25\u20139 in a strong WAC, Lobo fans retained hope that New Mexico would gain an at-large berth to the tournament. The selection committee granted the WAC three spots in the field, but the Lobos were left out, a disappointment that would linger through the following season. They were again relegated to the NIT, losing to Oregon State and finishing 25\u201310, the team record for wins in a season at the time. Scarborough was named All-WAC and finished his career second (now third) in Lobo history in total assists.\nIn 1987\u201388 the Lobos were led by Charlie Thomas, a junior transfer from Wake Forest (17 points and 7.5 rebounds a game), and senior Greene (16.8 points, 6.8 rebounds). The team tallied early wins over UCLA, Ohio State, and at Texas before hosting #1 Arizona, led by All-Americans Sean Elliott and Steve Kerr. The Lobos jumped out to a 25\u20139 lead before the Wildcats chiseled away at the lead, cutting it to two late in the game. Elliott had an opportunity to put Arizona in the lead with a three-pointer with seconds remaining, but Greene blocked the shot to seal the win, the only time the Lobos have beaten a #1-ranked opponent. A week later the Lobos beat #5 Wyoming at The Pit, pushing them to 14\u20133 and earning a #19 ranking, their first appearance in the polls since Lobogate. They fell into a 6\u201310 slide, however, including 1\u20139 on the road, a chronic weakness of the Lobos under Colson, whose teams compiled a 24\u201365 record in road games. The Lobos again returned to the NIT, beating Pepperdine and Oregon before losing in the quarter-finals to Ohio State, a team they had beaten earlier in the season, finishing with a 22\u201314 record. Greene completed his career as the only Lobo ever to surpass 1,500 points, 600 rebounds, 300 assists, and 200 steals, averaging 16 points and six rebounds a game as a Lobo.\nColson was forced to resign after the season ended, a move that remains somewhat controversial. Former UNM AD John Bridgers believed Colson had never received the full support of the Lobo community. Colson said the popularity and continued presence of Ellenberger during his early years were unnerving and that he sometimes felt in competition with the former coach. Bridgers had been replaced as AD the year before by John Koenig, who did not believe Colson could take the Lobos to the next level. Colson's teams had gone 107\u201362 (.633) in his last five seasons, but his failure to win the conference or to make the NCAA tournament were common criticisms. Colson had also clashed with Koenig in a contract dispute and had gone over his head to resolve the issue. Colson's supporters pointed to the strong recruiting class he had coming in, arguing that his best teams were ahead of him, as well as to the integrity and academic success forged by Colson. Complicating matters, Koenig himself was fired three months later and eventually faced indictment on criminal charges for his activities as AD. In the end, fans wanted more than Colson had managed to achieve, and despite the respect he had earned for rebuilding the program, the disappointment of failing to reach the NCAA tournament fueled support for a change.\n\nDave Bliss (1988\u20131999)\nDave Bliss recorded the most wins as head coach in Lobo history, compiling a 246\u2013108 (.695) record, with seven NCAA tournament appearances and three trips to the NIT. The hiring search after Colson's departure included a brief flirtation with Indiana coach Bobby Knight, who visited Albuquerque and was reportedly offered the job. Knight acknowledged that he had seriously considered the offer but eventually declined, stating that he did not have the energy that would be required. Knight recommended Bliss, who had been his assistant at Army and Indiana before serving as head coach at Oklahoma and SMU.\nBliss inherited a strong nucleus of senior Charlie Thomas, junior Darrell McGee, and sophomores Luc Longley and Rob Robbins. All had been Colson recruits, and Bliss reportedly flew to Australia to secure Longley's return to New Mexico. The Lobos got off to a slow start in 1988\u201389, including losses to #11 Arizona and #6 Oklahoma. They then won 11 of 12, taking the WAC lead into the last month of the season. After a couple of upset losses at home, however, they fell into a tie for second and again settled for the NIT. The Lobos notched wins over Santa Clara and Pepperdine before losing to eventual tournament runner-up St. Louis, finishing the season at 22\u201311. The Lobos shot their best field goal percentage in a season, .542, placing them second in the nation, and McGee established the still-standing record for assists in a season. Thomas finished his career with over 1,000 points and 500 rebounds, one of two Lobos to accomplish that in just two seasons.\nThe Lobos had a roller-coaster season in 1989\u201390, buoyed by record-setting performances by Longley, Robbins, and McGee. They lost four straight early in the year, then won their next five; they lost seven of nine, but won their last seven regular season games; they carried that momentum into the NIT and reached its Final Four. Longley was named All-WAC, averaging 18.4 points and 9.7 rebounds while setting Lobo records for blocks in a season and per game. Robbins led the nation in free throw shooting, making 93.5% of his attempts, including 52 in a row at one point, both school records. McGee capped his career with Lobo records for most games played and most career assists. In the NIT, the Lobos knocked off Oregon, Oklahoma State, and Hawaii to make the Final Four in New York. They lost to St. Louis in the semi-finals, then in overtime to Penn State in the consolation game to finish the season 20\u201314.\nThe 1990\u201391 Lobos were again led by Longley averaging 19.1 points and 9.2 rebounds a game, with Robbins adding 14 points a game. The team began the season 11\u20132 but lost four straight, struggling on the road. They again finished strong, winning nine of their last eleven, including four of five on the road. They finished third in the WAC but received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, their first berth since 1978. They lost in the first round to #14 Oklahoma State to finish 20\u201310. Longley was again named All-WAC and finished his career as Lobo leader in scoring and rebounding, falling since to sixth in points and second in rebounds. He remains the Lobo career leader in blocks and blocks per game; second in career field goals made; and the only Lobo to record a triple-double, doing so twice. Longley was the seventh player selected in the 1991 NBA draft, by Minnesota, and he went on to win three NBA championships as a starter for the Chicago Bulls (1996\u201398). Robbins finished his career with the Lobo record for best career free throw percentage, third best three-point shooting percentage, and second most minutes played, having started all 133 games of his career.\nThe 1991\u201392 Lobos featured a balanced offense, with all five starters averaging in double figures, but they lacked a go-to scorer. Senior Willie Banks, an Albuquerque High product, led the team along with junior guards Ike Williams and Steve Logan and center Khari Jaxon. The team started slowly, including a home loss to #2 Arizona, but later won seven of eight to gain an early share of the WAC lead. Road struggles slowed them, however, and despite another strong finish they ended up a game out of the lead. Banks was named All-WAC and finished as Lobo career leader (now second) in three-point percentage. The Lobos returned to the NIT, where they beat Louisiana Tech and Washington State before losing at Virginia, finishing the season 20\u201313.\nThe 1992\u201393 Lobos had an experienced core with Williams, Logan, and Jaxon returning as seniors. They began the season 7\u20131, losing only at #14 Arizona while sweeping ranked New Mexico State. They began their WAC schedule with losses at Utah and BYU but rebounded to win eight of their next nine. The Lobos led the conference in scoring defense and were 15th in the nation, allowing 63.2 points per game. A pair of upset losses prevented them from catching the #9 Utes and #21 Cougars, who were tied atop the league at 14\u20131 late in the season. The Lobos beat both in The Pit in the final week, however, then upset BYU on the way to winning their first WAC tournament championship, and securing a trip to the NCAA tournament. Williams was named conference tournament MVP; he and Jaxon were both named All-WAC. The Lobos broke into the AP rankings at #21 and received a five-seed in the tournament, facing George Washington in the first round. The team had relied heavily on three-point shooting, hoisting over 100 more attempts than in any previous season, making 39%. Their shooting touch eluded them in the tournament, as several players were suffering from food poisoning before the game. They got into foul trouble and could not stop George Washington's strong inside game, falling in an upset and finishing the season 24\u20137.\nThe 1993\u201394 Lobos were picked in preseason polls to finish fifth in the WAC after losing their three leading players to graduation. Senior Greg Brown, a 5 ft 7in point guard from Albuquerque High, produced a monumental season, though, leading the Lobos to their first regular season WAC title in 16 years. Brown averaged 19.3 points a game, scoring over 30 four times, often in pivotal games, with a season-best 42; junior Marlow White averaged 17, senior Notch Neves 13, and promising freshman Charles Smith added over ten a game. The Lobos again relied on three-point shooting, attempting the most threes in school history while making nearly ten a game, leading the WAC. The Lobos started 11\u20132, with both losses to New Mexico State in close, exciting games. The team was undefeated at home in conference and won a key road game at BYU to seal the league championship, led by a torrent of points from Brown. They lost in the conference tournament but received a berth in the NCAA tournament as a ten-seed facing Virginia. The Lobos built a 15-point lead early in the second half, but their shooting touch again disappeared, missing their last ten three-pointers. Smith led with 20 points, but the rest of the team shot a combined 29%, including 18% from three-point range. Virginia scored the last eight points of the game to take the lead, and the Lobos missed three shots at tying the game in the last 12 seconds, finishing the season at 23\u20138. White was named All-WAC and Bliss was WAC Coach of the Year; Brown was named All-WAC and WAC Player of the Year. Brown also won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award, given to the nation's top senior under six feet tall and gained an All-American Honorable Mention. Bliss stated, \"[a]s a coach, I have never compromised more of my offensive principles than while coaching Greg Brown. Because his best play is to dribble down the court and shoot it. Everybody knows that's not a great basketball play, but for us it was terrific.\"\nThe 1994\u201395 season was a rebuilding year for the Lobos, who finished 15\u201315 but won six of their last eight games. Sophomore Smith led the team, scoring 16 points a game, while three freshmen \u2013 Clayton Shields, David Gibson, and Royce Olney \u2013 played extensively. The 1995\u201396 team added to that nucleus Albuquerque High star Kenny Thomas, a USA Today and Parade magazine High School All-American. The young Lobo squad jumped out to a 10\u20130 start and a #25 ranking before losing a pair of league road games. Smith averaged 19.5 points a game and Shields added 14.5, while Thomas tallied 14.7 points and 7.8 rebounds a game, setting Lobo standards for freshmen. The Lobos were swept by #7 Utah, dropping to 17\u20134, but they won their last seven games to finish second in conference. They rode the momentum into the WAC tournament championship game and beat the Utes behind a dominant 30-point, 17-rebound performance by Thomas, earning their tenth straight win and a berth in the NCAA tournament. The Lobos were ranked #23 and received a seven-seed to play Kansas State. The Lobos broke open a close game in the second half with a 26\u20137 run. Shields led the way with 25 points and 10 rebounds, with Smith adding 15, overcoming a foul-plagued game for Thomas. The Lobos next faced two-seed Georgetown and took a slim lead into the second half. Shields again led with 19 points. With Thomas again slowed by foul trouble, the Lobos were outmatched inside and could not stop All-American Allen Iverson, who scored 20 in the second half. The Lobos finished the season 28\u20135, their highest season win total and winning percentage to date. Smith and Thomas were named All-WAC, and Bliss was again named WAC Coach of the Year.\nThe 1996\u201397 Lobos returned all their principal players, while adding freshman Lamont Long, who would become a starter by mid-season. The team entered the year #18 and would remain ranked throughout the next three seasons. The Lobos started 11\u20131, losing at Texas Tech but beating #11 Arizona and rising to #11 themselves. The WAC had expanded to 16 teams in the off-season, and eight WAC teams won at least 20 games. The Lobos lost three tough road games but beat #4 Utah in The Pit, pushing them to a #9 ranking \u2013 they went 18\u20130 at home for the season. Smith led in scoring for the third straight season, averaging 17.5 a game, while Shields scored 15.5, and Thomas added 14 points and seven rebounds a game. New Mexico later lost at Utah in a blowout, then lost a close game to the #3 Utes in the WAC tournament. The Lobos were ranked #11 and received a three-seed in the NCAA tournament, their best seed ever. Against Old Dominion in the first round, the Lobos struggled with three-point shooting and turned to their inside game. Thomas had 15 points and eight rebounds, sealing the win with a pair of late free throws, while Long added 14 points and nine boards. They then faced six-seed Louisville in a closely contested game that went down to the final play. The Lobos forced a turnover, down 64\u201363, but their set play broke down and Gibson missed an unbalanced, driving shot, ending the Lobo season at 25\u20138. Bliss would identify the loss as a particular disappointment, believing that the Lobos were the better team. Smith led with 16 points and seven rebounds in his final game as a Lobo. He was again named All-WAC and finished as the leading scorer in Lobo history, with 1,993 points, and the leader in field goals made, having started every game of his career. Smith was chosen by the Miami Heat with the 26th pick in the first round of the 1997 NBA draft, playing five seasons in the NBA and several more in Europe.\n\nThe 1997\u201398 Lobos had four starters returning and entered the season ranked #11. They began the year 11\u20131, rising to #8 before losing at #15 UCLA. They later lost at #5 Arizona but beat undefeated, #3 Utah as Olney hit two three-pointers in the final moments, including the game winner at the buzzer. Thomas averaged 17 points and nine rebounds, Shields 17 points and seven rebounds, and Long 14. Olney added 15 a game while shooting a Lobo record .513 from three-point range, as the team set the Lobo record for threes in a season. The Lobos were 21\u20133 and back at #11 when they lost at #19 TCU, at #5 Utah, and had a team record 41-game home-winning streak ended by BYU. They rebounded to reach the final of the WAC tournament before losing at UNLV but still received a four-seed in the NCAA tournament. Facing Butler in the first round, the Lobos were already without an injured Olney when Gibson suffered a concussion and broken finger; Thomas again spent the game in foul trouble. Unfazed, Long scored 22, Shields had 17, and bench reserves added 33 points as the Lobos won handily. Against five-seed Syracuse, however, the depleted Lobos shot under 26% and lost to finish the season 24\u20138. Thomas was named second-team All-American, and he and Shields were both All-WAC. Shields finished his career as the third (now fourth) leading scorer in Lobo history and as career leader in three-pointers. Gibson finished as Lobo career leader in minutes played. Attendance at The Pit remained in the top ten nationally during the Bliss years, finishing sixth in the nation twice and reaching its highest season average ever in 1997\u201398 at 17,625 per game.\nThe 1998\u201399 Lobos again started strong with a 12\u20131 record, reaching #11; they stood at 16\u20132 after beating #7 Arizona but then lost four of five, struggling on the road. Thomas averaged 18 points and 10 rebounds, Long 17 points and 6.5 boards. The team won seven of their last nine, both losses coming to #8 Utah, in Salt Lake and in the WAC tournament final. The Lobos advanced to the NCAA tournament for the fourth straight season, garnering a nine-seed against Missouri. Thomas had his best NCAA performance with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and four blocks, while Long added 17 points and 12 rebounds and made the game-winning basket in the closing seconds. The Lobos then fell to eventual national champion Connecticut, shooting just 26%, to finish 25\u20139. Thomas was named All-WAC for the third time and finished his career as the second leading scorer and top rebounder in Lobo history. He was selected as the 22nd pick in the first round of the 1999 NBA draft by Houston and played for 11 seasons in the NBA.\nThe four seasons with Kenny Thomas in the line-up was the best stretch by the Lobos to date. They compiled a 102\u201330 (.772) record while making the NCAA tournament and winning in the first round all four years. Bliss had won 246 games as Lobo head coach and reached the NCAA tournament seven times, both school records. His teams won twenty or more games and reached post-season tournaments in ten of his 11 seasons, and he coached the four leading scorers in Lobo history. Yet, despite his success, Bliss faced mounting criticism from fans and the media for poor academic performance by his players, lax discipline, lightweight schedules, and the failure to advance to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. Deciding it was time to move on, Bliss resigned and accepted the head coach position at Baylor, reportedly more than doubling his UNM salary. In 2003, he was forced to resign from Baylor embroiled in an ugly scandal that would end his college coaching career.\n\nFran Fraschilla (1999\u20132002)\nFran Fraschilla coached at New Mexico for three seasons, compiling a 55\u201341 (.572) record with three NIT appearances. Fraschilla was hired days after Bliss resigned, touted as a great recruiter and up-and-coming coach after leading Manhattan and St. John's to the NCAA tournament. He had left St. John's under murky circumstances, however, and worked as a broadcaster and scout during the preceding season.\nBefore the 1999\u20132000 season, the Lobos and seven other teams left the WAC to form the Mountain West Conference (MWC). Fraschilla inherited three returning starters, but the team was clearly heading into a rebuilding period after losing Thomas. The inconsistent squad started 5\u20135 but then stunned 21-point favorite, #2 Arizona in Tucson, the highest ranked opponent the Lobos had beaten on the road since 1966. The team meandered to a 13\u201311 record but then won four straight, including over #21 Utah. They went to the NIT and beat South Florida before losing at eventual champion Wake Forest, finishing 18\u201314. Lamont Long averaged 18.7 points a game to lead the league and earn All-MWC honors, finishing his career as the third leading scorer in Lobo history, three points ahead of former teammate Shields.\nThe Lobos added transfer Ruben Douglas from Arizona before the 2000\u201301 season, but other key recruits were sidelined by injury and disciplinary problems. Several players left the team, some claiming abuse by Fraschilla. The Lobos started the season 12\u20132, with an overtime win at Sweet 16-bound Gonzaga, but a blowout loss at #1 Stanford began a 1\u20136 slump, including several poor road performances. Douglas was an explosive scorer and led the team with 16 points a game. The Lobos heated up in the MWC tournament, reaching the final but losing on a missed shot at the end of the game. They went to the NIT and beat Bliss-led Baylor and Pepperdine in The Pit before losing at Memphis to finish 21\u201313.\nFraschilla felt he had his system and recruits in place going into the 2001\u201302 season, and Lobo fans were eager for the team to return to the NCAA tournament. The Lobos lost to #13 Stanford in their opener but moved to 10\u20133 as Douglas led the way with 18 points a game. Hosting #18 Gonzaga, Douglas missed a pair of free throws to send the game into overtime, and the Lobos lost; point guard Marlon Parmer ripped teammates in the locker room, beginning a string of problems on court and off. The team went on a 4\u201310 slide starting with a blowout loss at home to Utah, after which Parmer was dismissed, and culminating with forward Patrick Dennehy shoving teammates and walking off the court during a loss at Air Force. Fraschilla had lost the team: nine players had left the program or been dismissed during his tenure. The team finished 16\u201314 after another blowout loss at Minnesota in the NIT. Fraschilla resigned shortly after the season, concluding that \"it was best for everyone that I leave.\"\n\nRitchie McKay (2002\u20132007)\nRitchie McKay was head coach at New Mexico for five seasons with a record of 82\u201369 (.543) and one NCAA tournament appearance. After several coaches were discussed as candidates, some turning down offers, McKay was hired in a late night surprise and was not a popular choice among Lobo fans. His father played at UNM for Bob King, but McKay had only coached for brief stints at Portland State, Colorado State, and Oregon State, with an 83\u201389 career record.\nMcKay faced a major rebuilding project in 2002\u201303 compounded by further dismissals and injuries that cut the team to seven scholarship players. They languished to a 10\u201318 finish, the first losing season for the Lobos in twenty years. Senior Ruben Douglas was the lone offensive threat and became the only Lobo ever to lead the nation in scoring, averaging 28 points a game. He was named MWC Player of the Year and finished his career as the fifth leading scorer in Lobo history. A grim year for the program began with a severe spinal cord injury to guard Senque Carey, who would recover fully but never play again. Discipline trouble and player defections continued into the off-season. Misfortune turned to tragedy with the murder of former Lobo Patrick Dennehy \u2013 leading to a scandal at Baylor implicating Dave Bliss \u2013 and the suicide of Lobo transfer Billy Feeney. Both had close friends and long-time teammates still on the Lobo roster.\nBradley transfer Danny Granger became eligible during the 2003\u201304 season and led the team with 19.5 points a game. The young squad showed promising signs early but struggled in conference to finish 14\u201314. All returned for 2004\u201305, and Granger turned in a spectacular season, averaging 19 points and nine rebounds a game to gain All-American recognition. All five starters averaged in double figures, but the team had little depth and relied heavily on Granger. The Lobos were 10\u20131 when they lost to #5 Wake Forest, and 14\u20132 when Granger suffered an injury and missed three games, all losses. They won 12 of 13 after Granger returned, however, winning the MWC tournament final over #15 Utah and receiving a 12-seed in the NCAA tournament. Facing #22 Villanova, the Lobos shot 18% in the first half, scoring just eleven points and trailing by as much as 24. They battled to within five points in the second half but could not overcome their poor start. Granger was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 17th pick in the first round of the 2005 NBA draft and has placed among league leaders in scoring and been named an All-Star during his career.\nMcKay continued to attract strong transfer players, but discipline issues persisted in 2005\u201306. Versatile senior guard Mark Walters led the team with 16 points a game, but after winning four straight to build a 16\u20139 record, they lost four of five to finish 17\u201313 and did not receive a post-season bid. Road struggles kept the team from gaining momentum, a chronic problem as the Lobos went 8\u201343 in away games under McKay. The 2006\u201307 team featured talented Kansas transfer J. R. Giddens, who led the team with 16 points a game, but discipline problems limited his playing time. The team began 9\u20132 with an upset over #8 Wichita State but wilted in league play, going 4\u201312 and finishing 15\u201317. Fan criticism had reached a crescendo and attendance at The Pit had been dropping significantly. First-year Athletic Director Paul Krebs announced before the end of the season that McKay would not return for the following season.\n\nSteve Alford (2007\u20132013)\nSteve Alford coached the Lobos for six seasons, compiling a 155\u201352 (.749) record with three NCAA tournament appearances, at least a share of four league titles, and two conference tournament championships. As a player Alford had been a prolific scorer and two-time All-American at Indiana, winning a national championship, and earning an Olympic gold medal with the U.S. national team. He had been a collegiate coach for 16 seasons, the previous eight at Iowa, amassing over 300 career wins.\nAn early objective for Alford was to change the culture of the program regarding discipline and academic focus. Under McKay, J.R. Giddens had frequently missed games due to disciplinary problems. Alford applied a strict regimen and Giddens responded with a standout senior season, leading the team with 16 points and nine rebounds a game. Six other players averaged between seven and ten points as balanced scoring became a hallmark of Lobo squads under Alford. The Lobos began the 2007\u201308 season 14\u20132 before losing four of six in league; they then won eight of nine to close out the regular season. They lost in the conference tournament but received a bid to the NIT, losing at Cal to finish 24\u20139, the most wins for a first-year Lobo coach to date. Giddens was named MWC Co-Player of the Year and received an AP All-American Honorable Mention. He was selected as the 30th pick in the first round of the 2008 NBA draft by Boston.\nThe 2008\u201309 Lobos mixed four veterans with young Alford recruits and were picked in the preseason to finish fifth in the MWC. Senior Tony Danridge led the unit with 15 points a game, though they again relied on balance and teamwork. The Lobos struggled to a 9\u20137 start before pulling together in league play, going 12\u20134 after winning their final five games to gain a share of the MWC title. They lost in the first round of the conference tournament, however, and were again relegated to the NIT, where they beat Nebraska but lost at Notre Dame, finishing the season 22\u201312. Danridge was named All-MWC, and Alford was tabbed MWC Coach of the Year.\n\nThe 2009\u201310 Lobos were again a young squad picked to finish fifth in the MWC in preseason polls. Versatile JC transfer Darington Hobson joined lone senior Roman Martinez, junior Dairese Gary, and eight sophomores and freshmen. The Lobos jumped out to a 12\u20130 start with wins over #25 Cal and #16 Texas A&M, vaulting to #12 in the national rankings. After losing at Oral Roberts, they beat #20 Texas Tech and a Dayton squad that would go on to win the NIT. Hobson led the team with 16 points, nine rebounds, and 4.6 assists a game, the only Lobo to ever lead in all three. Martinez added 14 points and six rebounds a game, and Gary 13 points and four assists. The Lobos dropped their first two MWC games but then reeled off 15 straight wins \u2013 their second longest winning streak ever \u2013 sweeping #10 BYU. The Lobos rose to #8 in the polls and won the MWC title. They lost in the conference tournament but received a three-seed in the NCAA tournament. The team had relied heavily on its starters and was worn down with fatigue and injuries. They struggled to win against first round opponent Montana, and Hobson injured his wrist and back. In the second round the hobbled Lobos could not keep up with athletic, fast-breaking Washington. They finished 30\u20135, the most wins in a Lobo season, while going 10\u20132 in road games and 6\u20130 against ranked teams, also team highs. Alford was again named MWC Coach of the Year, and Gary was All-MWC. Hobson was named as MWC Player of the Year and a third-team All-American. He declared for the 2010 NBA draft and was selected in the second round by Milwaukee. Martinez was honored as an Academic All-American and received the NCAA Chip Hilton Player of the Year Award for outstanding character, leadership, integrity, and talent.\nThe early departure of Hobson left the Lobos with just one senior again in 2010\u201311: Gary led with 14 points and 5.5 assists a game, carrying the young team at times. He was joined by UCLA transfer Drew Gordon, who averaged 13 points and 10.5 rebounds, and the program's most successful freshman class to date, including starter Kendall Williams who scored 12 points a game. The Lobos began the season 10\u20131, but youth caught up to them in league play and they went .500 the rest of the way. They beat #3 BYU in Provo to sweep the regular season series but lost to the Cougars in the conference tournament. Gary injured his knee in the game, a sad career end for a four-year starter and steady leader. The Lobos went to the NIT and beat UTEP before losing at Alabama, finishing 22\u201313.\nGordon became a dominating inside presence in 2011\u201312, averaging 14 points and 11 rebounds, registering 19 double-doubles, and setting the Lobo season record for rebounds. Williams and fellow sophomore Tony Snell scored in double figures. The team played exceptional defense, allowing under 60 points per game, its fewest in the shot clock era, placing among national leaders in several categories. After two early losses, the Lobos won 13 straight en route to a 15\u20132 mark. They dropped a pair of league games but then won seven straight, winning at #13 San Diego State and trouncing #11 UNLV to take the league lead and climb into the national rankings at #18. Two road losses made them settle for a share of the regular season MWC title, but they again beat ranked SDSU and UNLV to secure the conference tournament championship, the first time they won both titles in a season. Gordon was named All-MWC and conference tourney MVP. The #21 Lobos received a five-seed in the NCAA tournament facing Long Beach State. Gordon had 18 points and 13 rebounds, while Williams added 16 with two late baskets to seal the win. Against four-seed Louisville, the Lobos took an early lead, fell behind by 15, then battled back to within two late in the game. Gordon had 21 points and 14 rebounds, but the team shot poorly from three-point range and could not overcome the deficit, finishing the season 28\u20137.\nThe 2012\u201313 Lobo squad was dominated by juniors and sophomores, though all were veteran contributors, including three returning starters. The team was again defense-oriented, surrendering just 60 points a game and grinding out close wins, frequently coming from behind. Williams, Snell, and center Alex Kirk led a balanced attack with seven players leading the team in scoring in individual games. The Lobos climbed to #16 with a 12\u20130 start, with a win over #19 Connecticut, before losing to NCAA tournament-bound South Dakota State; they won at #8 Cincinnati then lost at St Louis, which later reached #13. The Lobos' strength of schedule powered them to a #2 RPI ranking, and they won a program-record 15 games away from The Pit. The MWC enjoyed its best season to date with four teams achieving national rankings and five making the NCAA tournament. The Lobos lost on the road to ranked San Diego State and UNLV but beat both at home and won nine out of ten to clinch the league title. Williams hit a school-record 10 threes and scored 46 points at Colorado State, both MWC records. Snell paced the offense down the stretch, averaging 18 points a game and leading the Lobos to the MWC tournament championship. The Lobos were ranked #10 and received a three-seed in the NCAA tournament, facing Harvard, but they again turned in a disappointing performance. Kirk led with 22 points and 12 rebounds, but the team shot poorly and trailed most of the game as the Crimson answered Lobo runs with timely three-pointers to seal the upset. The Lobos finished the season 29\u20136, their second-best record ever. Williams was named MWC Player of the Year, and Alford was named Coach of the Year.\nThe day before the NCAA tournament began, UNM announced a 10-year contract extension with Alford; 10 days later, he resigned to take the head coaching position at UCLA. In the interim, Snell announced he was declaring for the NBA draft. The tournament upset and departures were disheartening blows for Lobo fans. Alford had led the program back to national prominence, attaining its best six-year stretch ever while improving academic achievement. The Lobo players and fan base rallied around long-time associate head coach Craig Neal, hoping to maintain continuity, and he was hired to replace Alford. Snell was selected by Chicago with the 20th pick in the first round of the NBA draft.\n\nCraig Neal (2013\u20132017)\nCraig Neal was associate head coach under Alford for three seasons at Iowa and six seasons at UNM before taking the Lobo helm. Neal played for Bobby Cremins at Georgia Tech, earning All-ACC honors as he set the conference record for assists in a season. He played professionally for eight seasons then coached in the NBA for eight more before joining Alford at Iowa.\nNeal inherited four returning starters for the 2013\u201314 season, joining seven newcomers. Senior Cameron Bairstow had a breakout season, averaging 20 points and seven rebounds a game, achieving one of the best single-season improvements in school history. Williams averaged 16 points and five assists, and Kirk added 13 points and nine rebounds. The Lobos began the season 7\u20131, beating Cincinnati, which later reached #7, but losing to Massachusetts, later #13; they lost to Kansas, which peaked at #2, but beat Marquette. The team struggled at times as the bench developed, suffering a pair of home upsets to leave them 12\u20134. They then won 12 of 13, including a win over #6 San Diego State to knot the MWC race, but they lost the title showdown at SDSU after squandering a large lead. The teams met again in the conference tournament final, and the Lobos prevailed for their third straight MWC tournament championship. They received a seven-seed in the NCAA tournament, facing Stanford. Following a familiar pattern, the Lobos fell behind early then battled back. Bairstow led with 24 points and eight rebounds, but the team shot poorly and their comeback fell short. The Lobos finished the season 27\u20137, Neal tallying the most wins ever for a first-year Lobo coach. Bairstow and Williams were named first team All-MWC; Kirk was third team. Bairstow was named second-team All-American by Sports Illustrated. Williams finished his career as the fifth leading scorer in Lobo history, third in assists, and the MWC career assists leader.\nOn April 1, 2017, Neal was dismissed as head coach after compiling a record of 76\u201352 (.594).\n\nPaul Weir (2017\u20132021)\nOn April 11, 2017, Paul Weir was named head coach of the Lobos. Before the 2017-2018 season started, 10 of the 15 players from the previous season either transferred, left the team, or graduated. In his first season, Weir posted a 19-15 record and finished in 3rd place in the Mountain West. They lost in the 2018 Mountain West Championship to San Diego State 82-75.\nIn the 2018-2019 season, Weir was reliant on four transfers from both Division 1 programs or junior college transfers, as well as returning senior Anthony Mathis. UNM finished the season 14-18 and in 7th place in the Mountain West. The highlight of the season was a 85-58 win over No. 6 Nevada in The Pit. UNM lost in the Mountain West Championship quarterfinals to Utah State.\nThe 2019-2020 started promising for the Lobos. With the help of transfers JaQuan Lyle, J.J. Caldwell, Carlton Bragg Jr., and Vance Jackson, UNM exploded to a 15-3 start. This was short lived, however, and the Lobos went 3-11 to finish out the season. There were a multitude of reasons for this. Carlton Bragg Jr. was accused of sexual assault and later arrested for a DWI in January 2020. He was dismissed from the team. J.J. Caldwell was also kicked off the team in January because of a domestic violence accusation. Also in January, JaQuan Lyle hosted a party at an Airbnb where two people were shot, one of which was a UNM female athlete. It was also later revealed that UNM basketball players were also at the party after a 22 point loss to Nevada, after they had taken a charter flight that night. Lyle had not traveled to Nevada because of a knee injury. UNM would lose in the quarterfinals to Utah State in the Mountain West Championship.\nThe Lobos' 2020-2021 season was played outside of New Mexico. UNM played their \"home\" games at various venues outside of New Mexico due to statewide restrictions against sports competitions due to COVID-19. They finished the season with an 6-16 record.\nUNM released a statement on February 26, 2021, they will part ways with Weir at the end of the 2020\u201321 season.\n\nRichard Pitino (2021\u20132025)\nOn March 16, 2021, Richard Pitino was named the 22nd head coach of the Lobos. Pitino inherited 6 transfers, including a trio of Power-5 talent in Jaelen House, Jamal Mashburn Jr., and Gethro Muscadin. The Lobos started out 8-6 in the non-conference, including a win against in-state rival New Mexico State where the game was delayed due to a power outage at Pan American Center. In Mountain West play, however, the Lobos went 5-12. The highlight of the season was a 75-66 win over No. 22 Wyoming. They went on to lose in the first round in the Mountain West Championship against Nevada.\n2022\u201323 Season: The Lobos started with a 14\u20130 record, with significant wins over teams like Saint Mary's and Iona. Despite a mid-season slump, they finished with a 22\u201312 overall record and an 8\u201310 conference record, earning a berth in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The Lobos were led by first-team All-Mountain West guards Jamal Mashburn Jr. (the conference\u2019s top scorer) and Jaelen House (third in the nation in steals), along with conference newcomer of the year Morris Udeze (the conference\u2019s leader in double-doubles). His contract was extended through the 2027\u201328 season, reflecting the program\u2019s progress under Pitino\u2019s leadership.\n2023\u201324 Season: Pitino led UNM to a 26\u201310 record, securing the Mountain West Conference Tournament title\u2014the program\u2019s first in a decade\u2014and returning to the NCAA Tournament after a ten-year absence. The Lobos downed Air Force, and three NCAA Tournament teams, Boise State, Colorado State and San Diego State, on consecutive days in Las Vegas to become the first team in Mountain West history to win the conference tournament by winning four games. The Lobos were led by five All-Mountain West players, Donovan Dent (second team), JT Toppin (second team and Mountain West Freshman of the Year), Jaelen House (third team), Jamal Mashburn Jr. (media\u2019s third team) and Mustapha Amzil (Mountain West Co-Sixth Man of the Year). His extension was further extended through the 2028\u201329 season, underscoring the sustained growth and achievements of the team.\n2024\u201325 Season: The Lobos finished with a 27\u20138 record, claiming the Mountain West regular-season title with a 17\u20133 conference record. The Lobos were led by dynamic duo of All-Mountain West Players: Mountain West Player of the Year, Donovan Dent (first team MW); Nelly Junior Joseph (first team MW & first team defense) and Tru Washington (honorable mention). They advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament, defeating Marquette before falling to Michigan State.\nOn March 25, 2025, Pitino accepted the head coaching position at Xavier University.\n\nEric Olen (2025-Present)\nOn March 30, 2025, Eric Olen, formerly the head coach at UC San Diego, was appointed as the head coach of the UNM Lobos men\u2019s basketball team. Olen led UC San Diego to a NCAA Tournament appearance in 2025.\n\nThe Pit\nEarly New Mexico basketball teams played in what became known as the Old Wooden Gym, where the walls were the out-of-bounds markers. In 1928 Coach Roy Johnson organized construction of Carlisle Gymnasium, seating about 1,500 spectators with later additions doubling that figure, and in 1957 Johnson Gymnasium opened, with a capacity of 7,800. The success of the Lobos under Bob King led to rapidly growing fan interest. Attendance doubled, Johnson Gym was soon selling out, and plans for a larger arena began to be developed.\nUniversity Arena opened in 1966 but was soon nicknamed \"The Pit\" due to its innovative subterranean design, with the playing floor 37 feet below street level. The Lobos have enjoyed exceptional success at The Pit, winning over 80 percent of their games and mounting home-winning streaks of over 20 games four times, with the longest of 41 straight in 1996\u201398. The Lobos have made 14 NCAA tournament appearances and 17 NIT appearances since the opening of the arena. In 1992 the basketball court at The Pit was named \"Bob King Court\" in honor of the coach who made its construction possible.\nAttendance at Lobo games in The Pit has consistently been among the national leaders in college basketball, averaging over 15,400 fans per game since it opened. The Lobos finished in the top five nationally in attendance 16 times in their first 20 years at The Pit, reaching second five times, and they were in the top ten all but one season through 2002. The design of the arena makes it one of the loudest venues in college basketball, creating a hostile playing environment for visitors. A study of decibel levels at collegiate basketball arenas found that a game at The Pit registered as the loudest at 118 decibels, comparable to a turbo-fan aircraft at takeoff power. Noise levels up to 125 decibels have been measured, close to the pain threshold for the human ear. Contributing to the intimidating environment for visitors is the mile high elevation of The Pit, emphasized to visiting teams with a message along the wall of the tunnel from the locker rooms down to the playing floor saying, \"Welcome to the legendary Pit, a mile high and louder than...\"\nThe Pit has garnered praise as one of the top venues in college basketball from sports reporters, announcers, and opposing coaches. Sports Illustrated listed The Pit among its Top 20 Sporting Venues of the 20th Century. Jim Boeheim, Lute Olson, and Steve Fisher have praised Lobo fans and the exciting atmosphere coaching at The Pit. Rick Majerus, who compiled a 5\u201311 record against the Lobos at The Pit, tying him with Don Haskins for most wins by a visiting coach, noted the intensity and dedication of Lobo fans and their knowledge of the game, The Pit hosted the 1983 NCAA Final Four, the last time the event was held on a college campus. North Carolina State upset heavily favored Houston in the memorable championship, sealing the victory with a last second basket. The video clip of NC State coach Jim Valvano celebrating at the end of the game documents one of the most famous moments in NCAA basketball history and is a staple of NCAA tournament television coverage.\n\nRenovations completed in 2010 added space and state-of-the-art amenities for fans and players. Luxury suites and club seats were added, along with digital video boards, expanded concourses, additional restrooms and concession stands, and upgraded training facilities, while preserving the historic character of the building. The upgrade reduced seating capacity to 15,411, trading some seating for greater comfort and amenities. The building facade was also transformed, adding extensive glasswork and a steel superstructure.\n\nNaming rights\nIn December 2014, Albuquerque-based restaurant chain WisePies Pizza & Salad purchased the naming rights for the arena, whose official name became \"WisePies Arena (aka The Pit)\". On April 27, 2017, UNM asked WisePies to relinquish the naming rights, per the terms of the agreement, and WisePies agreed to do so.\nOn May 3, 2017, UNM announced a $10 million naming rights agreement with Dreamstyle Remodeling, an Albuquerque-based construction business, covering both The Pit and the UNM football stadium. The official name of the facilities became Dreamstyle Arena and Dreamstyle Stadium.\nOn September 18, 2020, it was announced that the naming rights deal with Dreamstyle Remodeling was ending after only three years.\n\nTraditions\nThe official mascot of the University of New Mexico is the \"Lobo\", the Spanish word for \"wolf\", adopted by the school in 1920. Human mascots, dubbed \"Lobo Louie and Lobo Lucy\", members of the cheerleading squad, roam The Pit during games rousing and entertaining fans. During the 1980s, a popular chant among Lobo fans was \"Everyone's a Lobo, Woof Woof Woof!\", coupled with a hand gesture emulating a wolf. It was phased out during the '90s but has since become the signature cheer for Lobo fans.\n\nAt the start of each half during Lobo games at The Pit, fans continue to stand and clap their hands until both teams score a basket, adding pressure on teams that struggle to score for long stretches. The student section in The Pit, Section 26, is particularly noteworthy for the antics of its raucous fans, taunting and intimidating opposing players, often with personal remarks, and offering enticing visuals for television broadcasters: They chant, jump up and down in unison, shake newspapers and signs to make noise and create distractions, and some dress in costumes and body paint. The noise level of the boisterous fans, the intimacy created by seating extending to the edge of the court, and the elevation contribute to what Coach Dave Bliss termed \"a Pit game.\"\nThe Lobo Howl is an event held initially on midnight of the first day the NCAA allows teams to practice. Over the years it has evolved into a family-like atmosphere held during the evening, including player introductions, practice drills and scrimmages, three-point shooting and slam dunk contests, and other festivities. Student-athletes from both men's and women's squads participate and sign autographs for fans, and the event is used to attract recruits invited to attend. The 2013 Howl drew over 10,000 fans and featured the introduction of new coach Craig Neal, who entered the arena on his motorcycle.\nSportscaster Mike Roberts was the \"Voice of the Lobos\" on KKOB radio in Albuquerque from 1966 to 2008, becoming an icon among Lobo fans. He was an integral part of the Lobo fan experience, especially before most games were televised. Roberts noted the noise level in The Pit as a challenge for a broadcaster: \"There were a lot of times when I knew I was calling the game because my lips were moving, but I couldn't hear a thing I said.\" Many fans were disappointed and outraged when Roberts was dismissed by KKOB in 2008. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson declared May 8, 2008 as \"Mike Roberts Appreciation Day\" in honor of the sportscaster. In 1999, Roberts was inducted into the University of New Mexico Athletic Hall of Honor by the Alumni Lettermen's Association and received the Distinguished Service Award. Roberts was also inducted into the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nAthletic conferences\nThe Lobos compete in the Mountain West Conference (MWC) in NCAA Division I, joining as a founding member in 1999. The Lobos won the MWC regular season championship in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013, and they won the conference tournament in 2005, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2024.\nIn 1931, Lobo athletic teams began competing in the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, joining as a founding member along with other regional schools. The Lobos won the conference basketball championship in 1944 and 1945, seasons with shortened schedules due to World War II. UNM left the Border Conference in 1951 to join the Mountain States Conference, then known as the Skyline Eight.\nIn 1962, the Lobos became a founding member of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). They led the WAC in overall winning percentage over the 17-season span from 1962 to 1979, posting a won-loss record of 328\u2013161 (.671). The Lobos won the WAC regular season championship in 1964, 1968, 1974, 1978, and 1994, and they won the conference tournament in 1993 and 1996. The Lobos and seven other conference members left the WAC to form the MWC in 1999.\n\nCoaching records\nLeaders\nCareer wins, winning percentage (minimum 75 games coached):\n\nPre-Bob King era\nThe following table summarizes the records and accomplishments of the coaches before Bob King.\n\nNotes:\n\nJohnson, 104\u201338 (.732) from 1924 to 1934; 137\u201373 (.652) after 1936; 28\u201373 (.277) in last four seasons\nClements, 41\u201319 (.683) from 1944 to 1947, 72\u2013100 (.419) thereafter\nPre-Border Conference: 145\u201370 (.674) from 1899 to 1931\nBorder Conference: 205\u2013235 (.466) from 1931 to 1951\nSkyline Eight: 70\u2013195 (.264) from 1951 to 1962\nPre-Bob King total: 425\u2013509 (.455)\nTotal Win/Loss (1889\u20132017): 1500\u20131110 (.575)\nConference Season Championships (12: 5 WAC, 5 MWC, 2 Border)\n\n4 \u2013 Steve Alford (MWC: 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013)\n2 \u2013 Bob King (WAC: 1964, 1968)\n2 \u2013 Norm Ellenberger (WAC: 1974, 1978)\n1 \u2013 George Ellis (Border: 1944)\n1 \u2013 Woody Clements (Border: 1945)\n1 \u2013 Dave Bliss (WAC: 1994)\n1 - Richard Pitino (MWC: 2025)\nConference Tournament Championships (7: 5 MWC, 2 WAC)\n\n2 \u2013 Dave Bliss (WAC: 1993, 1996)\n2 \u2013 Steve Alford (MWC: 2012, 2013)\n1 \u2013 Ritchie McKay (MWC: 2005)\n1 \u2013 Craig Neal (MWC: 2014)\n1 \u2013 Richard Pitino (MWC: 2024)\nNCAA Tournament Appearances (17: 9\u201318 record)\n\n7 \u2013 Dave Bliss (1991, 1993\u201394, 1996\u201399), 4\u20137 record in NCAA tournament\n3 \u2013 Steve Alford (2010, 2012, 2013), 2\u20133\n2 \u2013 Norm Ellenberger (1974, 1978), 2\u20132\n2 \u2013 Richard Pitino (2024, 2025), 1-2\n1 \u2013 Bob King (1968), 0\u20132\n1 \u2013 Ritchie McKay (2005), 0\u20131\n1 \u2013 Craig Neal (2014), 0\u20131\n\n20-win seasons (27)\n\n10 \u2013 Dave Bliss (high: 28)\n6 \u2013 Steve Alford (30 \u2013 school record)\n3 \u2013 Norm Ellenberger (24)\n3 \u2013 Gary Colson (25)\n3 - Richard Pitino (27)\n2 \u2013 Bob King (23)\n1 \u2013 Fran Fraschilla (21)\n1 \u2013 Ritchie McKay (26)\n1 \u2013 Craig Neal (27)\n30-win seasons (1)\n\n1 \u2013 Steve Alford (30 \u2013 school record)\n\nIndividual and team records\nIndividual and team records are published in detail in the 2013\u201314 Lobo Media Guide.\n\nNational rankings\nThe Lobos attained their first national ranking in the 1964\u201365 season, reaching #10 in the AP poll.

    "summary": "The New Mexico Lobos men's basketball team represents the University of New Mexico, competing in the Mountain West Conference (MWC) in NCAA Division I. The university established basketball as a varsity sport in 1899 and began competing with regional colleges after establishing an athletics department in 1920.\nLobo basketball first achieved national prominence after Bob King was hired as head coach in 1962. King transformed a moribund program into a consistent winner and produced future ABA MVP Mel Daniels. The Lobos won the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) championship in 1964 and 1968, making frequent appearances in national rankings. The team reached the NIT tournament final in 1964 and received its first bid to the NCAA tournament in 1968. The success of the program continued after King departed, winning WAC titles in 1974, 1978, and 1994, winning the conference tournament in 1993 and 1996, and regularly earning post-season tournament bids.\nThe Lobos became frequent participants in the NCAA tournament during the 1990s and have made 16 appearances overall, as well as 20 NIT appearances. They have won the MWC regular season championship and the conference tournament five times each. In addition to Daniels, other prominent players produced by the Lobo program include five-time NBA champion Michael Cooper, three-time NBA champion Luc Longley, NBA all-star Danny Granger, and Kenny Thomas.\nThe most renowned enduring feature of the Lobo basketball program is its home venue, known as \"The Pit\", recognized as one of the best college basketball arenas in the country. The Pit opened in 1966 and the Lobos have been dominant playing there, winning over 80 percent of their games, while regularly placing among national leaders in attendance. The arena has frequently hosted NCAA tournament games, including the 1983 NCAA Final Four that featured one of the most memorable finishes in tournament history.",

    "biography": "The New Mexico State Aggies men's basketball team represents New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Founded in 1904, the Aggies compete in Conference USA after spending 18 seasons in the Western Athletic Conference from 2005 through 2023. The Aggies, who last played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2022, are one of 34 college basketball teams with multiple NBA retired jerseys from former players (Sam Lacey and John Williamson) and a team that reached the NCAA Final Four (in 1970). The team plays home games in the Pan American Center.\nA Lou Henson-coached team gained national attention during the 1970 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament by advancing to the Final Four. In 1992, a Neil McCarthy-coached team advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, though that appearance has since been vacated. Aggie Basketball has seen 26 NCAA tournament appearances, 5 NIT Tournament appearances, 21 regular season conference championships, and 13 conference tournament championships.\n\nHistory\nNMSU Basketball has seen much success throughout the years, reaching the NCAA Final Four in 1970, the Sweet Sixteen in 1992 among their 23 tournament appearances. Their two most successful coaches were Lou Henson and Neil McCarthy.\n\nJerry Hines era (1929\u20131940, '46)\nJerry Hines was an outstanding two-sport athlete, the head basketball and head football coach, and the athletic director.  During the later 1930s, the Aggie football team was 31\u201310\u20136 and the basketball team was 102\u201336 under Hines. The Aggie basketball team went to several postseason tournaments during this time, including the 1938 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament, and the 1939 National Invitation Tournament in New York City. The Hines era ended at the onset of World War II when he was called to duty in September 1940 as a member of a New Mexico National Guard unit assigned to the 45 Infantry Division. Hines did return for one more Aggie basketball season in 1946\u201347.\n\nLou Henson era (1966\u20131975)\nLou Henson played for the Aggies in the 1950s, coached at Las Cruces High School, and came from Hardin-Simmons University to become the head coach. His tenure was the most successful in Aggie history. His 1970 team reached the NCAA tournament Final Four, losing to a John Wooden-coached and eventual champion, UCLA.\nHenson led the Aggies to the NCAA tournament in six of his nine years. He left in 1975 for a successful 21-year run at Illinois.\n\nNeil McCarthy (1985\u20131997)\nNeil McCarthy came to Las Cruces in 1985 following a successful 10-year run at Weber State.  He had built Weber State into a regional power, and was equally successful at New Mexico State.  For most of McCarthy's tenure, the Aggies were the second-best team in the Big West, behind UNLV.  McCarthy led the Aggies to four straight regular season and tournament titles, including the 1992 Sweet Sixteen run.\n\nAcademic Scandal\nThe 1992 Sweet Sixteen run, along with two other NCAA runs in the early 1990s, was scrubbed from the books in 1996 when the NCAA found several players from that team received help on correspondence courses from a coach. Six Aggie players were found to have received help. Without those courses, the players would not have been eligible.\nThe McCarthy era came to a sudden and abrupt end just weeks before the 1997\u201398 season when new athletic director Jim Paul stripped him of coaching duties, citing the team's poor academic performance.  Only nine of McCarthy's players had graduated in 12 years, including only one in the last four.  McCarthy was originally supposed to serve as an assistant athletic director for the balance of his contract, but instead sued NMSU for wrongful termination\u2014a move that would come back to haunt the school later.\nIn 2000, the Aggies were rocked again by a scandal from the McCarthy era.  McCarthy had promised to hire a junior college coach as an assistant coach in return for bringing two of his top players to Las Cruces.  That coach, Fletcher Cockrell, helped the two players with coursework and exams.  The school placed the basketball program on two years' probation and withdrew from postseason consideration during the 2000\u201301 season.  The NCAA imposed an additional four years' probation and forced the Aggies to vacate McCarthy's last season and the first season of Henson's second stint.  The NCAA said that the penalties would have been even harsher if the school's former president, the former athletic director and McCarthy had still been at the school.\n\nLou Henson's 2nd run (1997\u20132004)\nHenson was lured from retirement to coach the team on an interim basis for the 1997\u201398 season after McCarthy's ouster. He initially came back because he wanted to help the Aggies during their search for a new head coach. Henson wanted to donate his time, but state law forbade him from coaching the program for free.  He ultimately settled for $1 per month. The following season Henson agreed to stay on as head coach on a permanent basis, leading the Aggies back to the NCAA tournament in 1999.\nHenson continued to coach the Aggies until being sidelined by non-Hodgkin lymphoma prior to the 2004\u201305 season. Due to Henson's illness the Aggies were led that year by assistant coach Tony Stubblefield, who guided the squad to a dismal 6\u201324 record, by far the school's worst season in twenty years. Henson officially announced his retirement from coaching in January 2005, and Stubblefield remained interim head coach for the remainder of the season.\n\nReggie Theus (2005\u20132007)\nOn March 31, 2005, NMSU hired 13-year NBA veteran Reggie Theus, then an assistant at Louisville under Rick Pitino, as head men's basketball coach. In his first season, Theus turned the Aggies from a 6\u201324 squad in 2004\u201305 to a 16\u201314 team in the 2005\u201306 season as the Aggies moved from the Sun Belt Conference to the Western Athletic Conference. In Theus's second year the Aggies finished the regular season at 22\u20138, won the WAC Tournament on their home floor, and earn an automatic bid to the 2007 NCAA tournament. Following the tournament Theus left NMSU to take over the head coaching position of the NBA's Sacramento Kings.\n\nMarvin Menzies (2007\u20132016)\nMarvin Menzies was named as Theus' successor, and like Theus before him, came to NMSU after having been an assistant to Pitino and had no previous Division I head coaching experience. In 2010 the Aggies again won the WAC Tournament and advanced to the NCAA tournament, falling 70\u201367 in the first round to eventual Final Four participant Michigan State. In 2012 the Aggies once again advanced to the NCAA tournament by winning the WAC Tournament for the third time in six seasons. They continued to appear in the NCAA tournament through 2015. After their 2016 NIT tournament appearance, Marvin Menzies was hired to take over the Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV) basketball program.\n\nPaul Weir (2016\u20132017)\nPaul Weir served in the role of associate head coach from July 2011 until he was promoted to head coach on April 26, 2016.  He helped the Aggies to five WAC Tournament Championships (2010, 2012\u20132015) and five NCAA tournament appearances. The Aggies have collected three WAC Championships during Weir's tenure. The Aggies have won back-to-back WAC regular season titles in 2015 and 2016 after collecting their first WAC regular season title in 2008. Overall, NM State has collected seven WAC titles during his nine years with the program. Weir left after one season to coach the New Mexico Lobos, a rival of the Aggies.\n\nChris Jans (2017\u20132022)\nFormer Bowling Green head coach Chris Jans was named the new head coach of the Aggies on April 17, 2017. He had been serving in an administrative role at Wichita State after being fired from BGSU in 2015 and was promoted to associate head coach of the Shockers just 4 days prior to being hired by NMSU. In his first season at NMSU, The Aggies won 28 games for the second year in a row, and won both the WAC regular season title and conference championship to advance to the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Clemson in the first round. In 2022 New Mexico State won a first round NCAA tournament game against University of Connecticut, before losing to Arkansas. Jans was hired by Mississippi State after the 2022 season.\n\nGreg Heiar (2022\u20132023)\nGreg Heiar was named the head coach of the Aggies on March 28, 2022. He was formerly the head coach at Northwest Florida State College, where he won the 2022 NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship.  On February 14, 2023, Greg Heiar was removed as the head coach of New Mexico State men's basketball team due to hazing allegations.\n\nSeason by season results\n* \u2014 Overall record includes tournament and postseason results; Regular\u2013season conference record and place contained in parentheses.\n** \u2014 Forfeit by Lamar University on Jan. 6, 2022, is not included in overall record, but is included in conference record.\n\nCoaches\nThe Aggies have had 27 coaches in their 110-year history. Six Aggie coaches have been named conference Coach-of-the-Year: Lou Henson in 1975, Ken Hayes in 1977, and Weldon Drew in 1983 in the Missouri Valley Conference; Neil McCarthy in 1989 and 1990 in the Big West Conference; Marvin Menzies in 2015, and Chris Jans in 2018, 2019 and 2020 in the Western Athletic Conference.\n\nPostseason Results\nNCAA tournament\nThe Aggies have appeared in 26 NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 11\u201327.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015 the round of 64 was known as the second round\n\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nNAIA tournament\nThe Aggies have appeared in four NAIA Tournaments. Their combined record is 5\u20134.\n\nNational Invitational tournament\nThe Aggies have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 2\u20135.\n\nAggies of note\nRing of Honor\nNew Mexico State's men's basketball Ring of Honor stands as a tribute to individual players and coaches that are distinguished as Aggie legends.  A player's number is retired upon reaching this milestone. A banner designating this honor is hung from the rafters in the Pan American Center.\nLou Henson \u2013 began his coaching career with the Aggies in 1966, eventually coaching the Aggies to 289 victories over 17 years. Henson finished with 779 victories including his wins at Illinois. Henson coached the Aggies to the Final Four and two Sweet Sixteens among the 10 NCAA tournament appearances. His career Aggie record is 289\u2013152, which is the winningest in Aggie history.\nSam Lacey (#44) \u2013 played for the Aggies from 1967 to 1970, including a trip to the Final Four. Lacey is 11th in Aggie all-time scoring and holds most rebounding records. He was a 1st Team All-American in 1970 and played in the NBA for 13 seasons, well enough to get his #44 jersey retired by the Sacramento Kings.\nBilly Joe Price (#31) \u2013 played from 1957 to 1961, including two trips to the NCAA tournament. Price is 15th on the all-time scoring list and among the career leaders in rebounding.\nJimmy Collins (#22) \u2013 played for the Aggies from 1967 to 1970 and helped them to the Final Four in 1970. Collins holds the Aggie season scoring record and rank 3rd all-time in career scoring. Collins played in the NBA for several seasons.\nJohn Williamson (#24) \u2013 is the most prolific scorer in Aggie history, averaging over 27 points per game during the 1971\u201372 and 1972\u201373 seasons.

  "North Carolina Tar Heels": {
    "biography": "The North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program is a college basketball team of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels have won six NCAA championships (1957, 1982, 1993, 2005, 2009, and 2017) in addition to a 1924 Helms Athletic Foundation title (retroactive). North Carolina has won a record 134 NCAA tournament matchups while advancing to 31 Sweet Sixteen berths (since 1975), a record 21 Final Fours, and 12 title games. It is the only school to have an active streak of reaching the National Championship game for nine straight decades (no other school has done it in more than six straight) and at least two Final Fours for six straight decades, all while averaging more wins per season played (20.7) than any other program in college basketball. In 2012, ESPN ranked North Carolina No. 1 on its list of the 50 most successful programs of the past fifty years.\nNorth Carolina's six national championships are tied with UConn for third-most all-time, behind UCLA (11) and Kentucky (8). UNC has also won eighteen Atlantic Coast Conference tournament (ACC) titles, and thirty-three ACC regular season titles. The program has produced many notable players who went on to play in the NBA, including four of ESPN's top 74 players of all-time: Michael Jordan, James Worthy, Vince Carter, and Bob McAdoo (tied for most with UCLA). Many Tar Heel assistant coaches and players have gone on to become head coaches elsewhere.\nFrom the Tar Heels' first season in 1910\u201311 through the start of the 2021\u201322 season, the program has amassed a .735 all-time winning percentage (second highest all-time), winning 2,294 games and losing 829 games in 111-plus seasons. The Tar Heels also have the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31 from the 1970\u201371 season through the 2000\u201301 season. On March 2, 2010, North Carolina became the second college basketball program to reach 2,000 wins in its history. The Tar Heels are currently 3rd all-time in wins. The Tar Heels are one of only four Division I men's basketball programs to have achieved 2,000 victories. Kentucky, Kansas, and Duke are the other three.\nCarolina has played 182 games in the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels have appeared in the NCAA Tournament championship game twelve times, and have been in a record 21 NCAA Tournament Final Fours. The Tar Heels have been selected to the NCAA Tournament 53 times (second-most all-time), and have amassed 133 victories (most all-time). North Carolina won the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1971, and has appeared in two NIT Finals with six appearances in the NIT Tournament. Additionally, the team has been the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament eighteen times, the latest being in 2024 (most No. 1 seeds all-time).\nNorth Carolina has been ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll an all-time record 927 weeks, has beaten AP No. 1 ranked teams 14 times, has the most 25-win seasons with 38, and has the most consecutive top-three ACC regular season finishes with 37. North Carolina has ended the season ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll 51 times and in the top 25 of the Coaches' Poll 53 times. Furthermore, the Tar Heels have finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll six times and ranked No. 1 in Coaches' Poll seven times. In 2008, the Tar Heels received the first unanimous preseason No. 1 ranking in the history of either the Coaches' Poll or the AP Poll.\n\nTeam history\nEarly years (1910\u20131953)\nNorth Carolina played its first game on January 27, 1911, beating Virginia Christian 42\u201321 at Bynum Gymnasium, the team's home from 1911 to 1923. The team's first coach was Nat Cartmell. Cartmell was charged with illegally playing dice with known gamblers and was fired after the 1913\u201314 season. He would be replaced by Charles Doak.\nIn the 1914\u201315 season, UNC joined the SAIAA, and would compete in the conference through the 1920\u201321 season. The 1917\u201318 team went 9\u20133 (7\u20130 at home) to finish 3rd in the SAIAA. On January 24, 1920, North Carolina beat Trinity College (Duke), 36\u201325, in the first-ever game of the Carolina-Duke rivalry.\n\nSoCon years\nIn 1921, the school joined the Southern Conference. Overall, the Tar Heels played 32 seasons in the Southern Conference from 1921 to 1953. During that period, they won 304 games and lost 111 for a winning percentage of 73.3%. The Tar Heels won the Southern Conference regular season title 9 times and the Southern Conference tournament 8 times.\n\nIn 1924, the Tar Heels moved to the Tin Can for home games. From 1924 to 1938, UNC would go 130\u201320 (.867 winning percentage) at the Tin Can. Rudimentarily built of steel, attempts to heat the Tin Can failed, with ice often forming inside: The Tin Can was always freezing [...] they had icicles in the corners. To stay warm the electricians put those big-wattage bulbs under the benches, and we had blankets and wore heavy sweat clothes. Later on they did get central heat in there, but it was never adequate. You couldn't dress there.\nOn February 29, 1924, UNC beat Kentucky, 41\u201320, in the first-ever game of the Kentucky\u2013North Carolina rivalry. The 1923\u201324 Tar Heels squad went 26\u20130, and was retro-picked as national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1943 and later by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. While intersectional play would not start on a regular basis for another decade, the clash with the Wildcats featured two teams reckoned by college basketball historians as the best in the nation. In North Carolina's first five seasons in the SoCon (from 1921\u201322 to 1925\u201326), they went 96\u201317, won four SoCon regular season championships, and four SoCon tournament championships. Their fast style of play and stingy defense earned these teams the nickname \"White Phantoms\", coined by sportswriter Oscar Bane Keeler of The Atlanta Journal, used as an alternative nickname for the Tar Heels through 1950.\nCartwright Carmichael was the first Tar Heel to earn first-team All-America honors in any sport in 1923, and was again selected in 1924. Jack Cobb was UNC's first three-time All-America (1924, 1925, 1926), and was named Helms Foundation Player of the Year in 1926. George Glamack followed suit in 1940 and 1941, being named Helms Foundation Player of the Year also. Both Cobb and Glamack are honored with their numbers being retired (Cobb did not have a number).\nIn 1939, the Tar Heels relocated their home arena to the Woollen Gymnasium, where they would play until 1965. On March 21, 1946, under Hall of Fame coach Ben Carnevale and All-Americans Hook Dillon and Jim Jordan, North Carolina beat NYU, 57\u201349, for their first win in the NCAA Tournament ever. Later in the 1946 NCAA tournament, UNC advanced to their first ever Final Four, losing to Oklahoma A&M, 43\u201340,\nin the championship game.\nFor most of the first four decades of the program's history, North Carolina had very little consistency at the head coaching position, reflecting the lack of emphasis on the sport in much of the South at the time. The first coach, Cartmell, doubled as the track coach. From 1923 to 1926, three coaches led the program in as many years. Norman Shepard led the team to an undefeated season in 1923\u201324 while attending law school. He was succeeded by one of his players, medical student Monk McDonald, who in turn gave way to Harlan Sanborn. Other early coaches included baseball coaches Charles Doak and James Ashmore and assistant football coach Bill Lange. All told, from 1910 to 1946, no coach stayed in Chapel Hill longer than five years. Carnevale, who led UNC to its first Final Four, left after only two years. Tom Scott ran the program for six years from 1946 to 1952, but was pushed out in favor of Frank McGuire after two consecutive losing years.\n\nFrank McGuire (1953\u20131961)\nThe modern era of Tar Heel basketball began in 1952, when Scott was pushed out after two consecutive losing seasons in favor of St. John's head coach Frank McGuire. School officials wanted a big-name coach to counter the rise of North Carolina State under Everett Case.\nOn December 1, 1952, McGuire coached his first game at UNC with a 70\u201350 win over The Citadel. In 1953, North Carolina split from the Southern Conference and became a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. On December 12, 1953, UNC beat South Carolina, 82\u201356, in their first ACC game ever. On December 14, 1955, UNC routed then-No. 5 Alabama 99\u201377. It was UNC's first defeat of a nonconference opponent ranked in the top 10 of a major media poll. On January 14, 1956, All-American Lennie Rosenbluth scored 45 points in a 103\u201399 win at Clemson. On February 24, 1956, Rosenbluth had 31 points in a 73\u201365 win over Duke to clinch UNC's first-ever ACC regular-season title (shared with N.C. State). The following season, in 1956\u201357, Lennie Rosenbluth scored 40 in a Tar Heel win at Duke to finish with a perfect 24\u20130 regular season record (14\u20130 in ACC). Rosenbluth was named 1957 Helms Foundation Player of the Year. Furthermore, in 1957, the Tar Heels won their first ACC Tournament and first NCAA Championship. On March 23, 1957, No. 1 North Carolina beat Wilt Chamberlain and No. 2 Kansas, 54\u201353, in triple overtime as Carolina capped off a perfect 32\u20130 season as national champions. C.D. Chesley, a Washington, D.C. television producer, piped the 1957 championship game in Kansas City to a hastily created network of five stations across North Carolina\u2014the ancestor to the longstanding syndicated ACC football and basketball package from Raycom Sports\u2014which helped prove pivotal in basketball becoming a craze in the state. The title game was the only triple overtime final game in championship history, which followed a triple overtime North Carolina defeat of Michigan State 74\u201370 the previous night.\nIn 1961, the Tar Heels were placed on NCAA probation for a year for violating \"provisions prohibiting excessive entertainment\" of prospective players and providing \"improper financial assistance\" to the parents of players. As a result, they were barred from the 1961 NCAA tournament and also withdrew from the 1961 ACC tournament.  Following the season, Chancellor William Aycock forced McGuire to resign.  As a replacement, Aycock selected one of McGuire's assistants, Kansas alumnus Dean Smith.\n\nDean Smith (1961\u20131997)\nOn December 2, 1961, Carolina beat Virginia, 80\u201346, in Dean Smith's first game as head coach. Smith's early teams were not nearly as successful as McGuire's had been. His first team went only 8\u20139, the last losing season UNC would suffer for 40 years. On January 13, 1964, All-American Deakon Patrick scored 40 and had 28 rebounds in 97\u201388 win over Maryland. On December 4, 1965, UNC beat William and Mary, 82\u201368, in the first game played at UNC's new home, Carmichael Auditorium. On December 16, 1965, Bobby Lewis scored a current UNC-record 49 points in a 115\u201380 win over Florida State. Smith's first five teams never won more than 16 games. This grated on a fan base used to winning; in 1965 some of them even hanged him in effigy. Smith would go on to take the Tar Heels to a reign of championships and national dominance. On March 17, 1967, North Carolina beat Princeton for Dean Smith's first NCAA Tournament win. Later, in the 1967 NCAA University Division basketball tournament, UNC beat Boston College to advance to Dean Smith's first Final Four, where they would lose to Dayton in the national semifinal. In 1968, Carolina appeared in their second consecutive Final Four. On March 23, 1968, they lost to Lew Alcindor and UCLA for the national title. On March 15, 1969, All-American Charlie Scott hit the game-winning jumper at the buzzer to beat Davidson, 87\u201385, to advance North Carolina to their third consecutive Final Four. On March 27, 1971, Bill Chamberlain scored 34 points as UNC beat Georgia Tech, 84\u201366, to win the NIT. On March 18, 1972, Carolina beat Penn, 73\u201359, to advance to their 4th Final Four in 6 years. All-American Bob McAdoo had 24 points and 15 rebounds, but fouled out with 13 minutes to play, as UNC lost to Florida State in the national semifinal. On March 26, 1977, the Tar Heels, back in the Final Four, edged UNLV, 84\u201383, in the national semifinal. Carolina, in the championship two days later, lost to Marquette, 67\u201359. On February 25, 1978, co-consensus National Player of the Year Phil Ford scored 34 points in his final game at Carmichael Auditorium, an 87\u201383 win over Duke. North Carolina returned to the Final Four in 1981. In the national semifinal, All-American Al Wood scored 39 in a win over Virginia. UNC would lose in the NCAA championship game to Indiana.\n\nThe following year, North Carolina won their second NCAA championship. On March 29, 1982, Final Four MOP James Worthy scored 28 points and Michael Jordan hit the game-winning shot with 17 seconds to play as Carolina beat Georgetown, 63\u201362, to win Dean Smith's first national championship. On January 18, 1986, North Carolina beat Duke, 95\u201392, in the first game played in UNC's new arena, the Dean Smith Center. On March 24, 1991, Carolina beat Temple, 75\u201372, to advance to the Final Four for the first time since 1982. In the national semifinal, Carolina fell to former UNC assistant coach Roy Williams and Kansas, 79\u201373. In 1993, UNC won their third NCAA title. On April 5, 1993, Final Four MOP Donald Williams scored 25 points as Carolina beat Michigan, 77\u201371, for Dean Smith's second NCAA championship. On March 25, 1995, North Carolina beat Kentucky, 74\u201361, to advance to another Final Four. UNC would fall to Arkansas in the national semifinal. On March 15, 1997, North Carolina beat Colorado, 73\u201356, in the NCAA tournament second round for Dean Smith's 877th win, breaking Adolph Rupp's all-time record for coaches. On March 23, 1997, the Tar Heels beat Louisville, 97\u201374, for another Final Four appearance. Smith would coach his final game, a 66\u201358 loss to Arizona in the national semifinal, on March 29, 1997. After 36 years as head coach, Smith retired on October 9, 1997. When he retired, Smith's 879 wins were the most ever for any NCAA Division I men's basketball coach (currently 5th all-time). During his tenure, North Carolina won or shared 17 ACC regular-season titles and won 13 ACC tournaments. They went to the NCAA tournament 27 times\u2013including 23 in a row from 1975 to 1997\u2013appeared in 11 Final Fours and won NCAA tournament titles in 1982 and 1993. The 1982 national championship team was led by James Worthy, Sam Perkins, and a young Michael Jordan. The 1993 national championship team starred Donald Williams, George Lynch and Eric Montross. While at North Carolina, Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the university's first African American scholarship basketball player, Charlie Scott.\n\nBill Guthridge (1997\u20132000)\nSmith unexpectedly retired before the start of practice for the 1997\u201398 season. He was succeeded by Bill Guthridge, who had been an assistant coach at the school for 30 years, the last 25 as Smith's top assistant. During Guthridge's three seasons as head coach, he posted an 80\u201328 record, making him tied for the then-NCAA record for most wins by a coach after three seasons. The Tar Heels reached the NCAA Final Four twice, in the 1998 tournament and again in the 2000 tournament. North Carolina reached the Final Four in 2000 as an 8-seed, their lowest seeding in a Final Four appearance.\n\nMatt Doherty (2000\u20132003)\nGuthridge retired in 2000 and North Carolina turned to Matt Doherty, the head coach at Notre Dame and a player on the 1982 championship team, to lead the Tar Heels. Doherty had little success while at North Carolina. In his first season, the Heels were ranked No. 1 in the polls in the middle of the Atlantic Coast Conference schedule and finished with a 26\u20137 record. The bottom fell out the following year, as the Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 8\u201320, the worst season in school history. They missed postseason play entirely for the first time since the 1965\u201366 season (including a record 27 straight NCAA Tournament appearances) and finished with a losing record for the first time since 1962 (Dean Smith's first year as coach). They also finished 4\u201312 in the ACC\u2014only the program's second losing ACC record ever. The 12 losses were six more than the Tar Heels had ever suffered in a single season of ACC play and placed them in a tie for 7th place\u2014the program's first finish below fourth place ever. The season also saw the end of UNC's run of 31 straight 20-win seasons and 35 straight seasons of finishing third or higher in the ACC.\nAfter bringing in one of the top 5 incoming classes for the 2002\u20132003 season, the Tar Heels started the season by knocking off a top 5 Kansas team and going on to win the Preseason NIT and returning to the AP top 25. North Carolina went on to finish the season 17\u201315, but a 6\u201310 record in ACC play kept them out of the NCAA Tournament. Doherty led the Tar Heels to the third round of the NIT, where they ended their season with a loss to Georgetown.\n\nRoy Williams (2003\u20132021)\nDespite the turnaround from the year before and the NIT appearance, at the end of the season Matt Doherty was replaced as head coach by Roy Williams. Williams had served as an assistant to Smith for 11 years before a successful 15-year tenure at Kansas, winning 9 conference regular season championships and taking his Jayhawk teams to four Final Fours. Smith himself convinced Williams to return home. Williams had also been courted by Smith for the UNC job when it had been open in 2000, but Williams had promised Nick Collison he would be at Kansas his entire college career and could not bring himself to leave Kansas at that time despite media speculation reporting Williams would take the job in 2000. Williams could not turn his mentor down a second time, so just two weeks after Doherty's resignation, Williams took the Carolina job. Williams was UNC's third coach in six years, the most turnover the program had faced since its early years. The previous two, McGuire and Smith, had covered a 45-year period.\nOn November 22, 2003, Carolina beat Old Dominion, 90\u201364, in Roy Williams\u2019 first game as head coach. In Williams' first season, the Tar Heels finished 19\u201311 and were ranked in a final media poll for the first time in three years. They returned to the NCAA tournament and were ousted in the second round by Texas. The following year, on April 4, 2005, the Tar Heels defeated Illinois, 75\u201370, to win their fourth NCAA title and Williams' first as a head coach. After winning the championship, Williams lost his top seven scorers, but the 2005\u201306 season saw the arrival of freshman Tyler Hansbrough and Williams was named Coach of the Year. The Tar Heels swept the ACC regular season and tournament titles in 2007 and 2008. The 2008 ACC tournament was the first time North Carolina had ever won the ACC Tournament without defeating at least one in-state rival during the tournament. North Carolina lost in the national semifinals of the 2008 NCAA tournament to Williams' former program Kansas.\n\nOn December 18, 2008, Tyler Hansbrough scored his 2,292nd career point, breaking Phil Ford's UNC career scoring record. In the 2008\u201309 season, the Tar Heels won their fifth NCAA title by defeating Michigan State in the championship of the 2009 NCAA men's basketball tournament. The Tar Heels won all six of that year's tournament games by at least 12 points, for an average victory margin of 20.2 points, and only trailed for a total of 10 minutes out of 240 through the entire tournament. Wayne Ellington was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, the fourth Tar Heel so honored.\nThe 2009\u20132010 Tar Heels struggled throughout the regular season finishing with a 16\u201315 record, and dropped to No. 3 in Division I in all-time wins. They later lost in the first round of the ACC Tournament, playing in the first \"play-in\" Thursday game for the first time since the ACC grew to 12 teams. The Tar Heels did not receive an NCAA tournament bid, and instead accepted a bid to the NIT. During the season, on March 2, 2010, Carolina beat Miami, 69\u201362, to become the second school in NCAA history to win its 2,000th game (North Carolina was in its 100th season of basketball at the time of this accomplishment). The Tar Heels made it to the final game of the NIT, losing to Dayton in the final game finishing with a 20\u201317 record.\nThe 2010\u20132011 Tar Heels, with the addition of Harrison Barnes, Kendall Marshall, and Reggie Bullock, eighth in the preseason polls, struggled out the gates, starting with a 2\u20132 record, the worst start since the 2001\u201302 season. After losses to Illinois and Texas, the Tar Heels fell out of the rankings. The losses of senior Will Graves, to dismissal, and Larry Drew II, to transfer and also the unexpected off-season transfers of David and Travis Wear did not help matters. However, the Tar Heels improved greatly during the conference season, finishing first in the ACC regular season with a 14\u20132 record. Williams was named Conference Coach of the Year for his efforts of getting his team to work through the adversity to finish strong in the regular season. Also during the season, the term Tar Heel Blue Steel was coined, referencing the Tar Heel men's basketball walk-ons. The term was started by one of the players, Stewart Cooper, in hopes that it would be a replacement for \"walk-ons\" and similar names, and soon enough Roy Williams caught on. North Carolina lost to Duke in the ACC Tournament Final and made a significant run in the NCAA Tournament until they were eliminated in the Elite Eight by Kentucky, finishing with a 29\u20138 record.\nThe 2011\u20132012 Tar Heels season started on November 11, 2011, as top-ranked Carolina beat Michigan State, 67\u201355, on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in San Diego. The Tar Heels finished the season with a record of 32\u20136, including a 14\u20132 ACC record to win the conference regular-season championship outright. The team fell to Florida State in the championship game of the 2012 ACC tournament and was a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional of the 2012 NCAA tournament; the team reached the Elite Eight and was defeated by Kansas 80\u201367. Before the Kansas game, the Tar Heels won their previous three games in the NCAA Tournament by an average of 13.7 points. In the second-round game versus Creighton, starting UNC point guard Kendall Marshall broke his right wrist with 10:56 remaining in the second half with UNC leading 66\u201350. Marshall continued to play by dribbling primarily with his left hand and left the game with two minutes left with UNC leading 85\u201369. Williams announced the injury at the Creighton post-game press conference. Marshall did not play in UNC's two following games in the NCAA Tournament, a 73\u201365 overtime win over Ohio in the Sweet 16 and the aforementioned 80\u201367 loss to Kansas in the Elite Eight.\n\nWith the departures of several stars from the 2012 team, The Tar Heels would begin a slow climb back to the top following the Elite Eight loss. The 2012\u201313 season ended with a loss to Kansas in the tournament for the second year in a row. In 2013\u201314, the Tar Heels became the only team in men's college basketball history to beat every team ranked in the top 4 in the preseason. The Tar Heels would finish 24\u201310 that year, ending the year by losing to Iowa State in the final seconds of the Round of 32. The 2014\u201315 team would improve, finishing the year 4th in the ACC and a Sweet 16 appearance, where they would lose to the Wisconsin. It was also the year that North Carolina would add Joel Berry II and Justin Jackson to the roster, who were both key contributors to the 2017 National Championship squad.\nIn 2015\u201316, led by seniors Marcus Paige and Brice Johnson, the Tar Heels earned their 30th ACC regular season title, 18th ACC tournament title, and 19th Final Four. They also appeared in their 10th NCAA title game, in which they lost on a buzzer beater to Villanova, despite Marcus Paige's dramatic three-pointer to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left. The Tar Heels finished with a 33\u20137 overall record and a 14\u20134 ACC record.\nThe following year, the Tar Heels were ranked No. 6 in the AP preseason poll, having lost Paige and Johnson but retaining 2016 ACC Tournament MVP Joel Berry II as well as forwards Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah Hicks. After early season losses to Indiana and Kentucky, the Tar Heels won their 31st ACC regular season title. Despite never being ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll and losing to Duke in the semifinals of the ACC tournament, the Heels earned a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. On March 26, 2017, Luke Maye hit a jump shot with 0.3 seconds left to beat second-seed Kentucky, 75\u201373, to advance to Carolina's record 20th Final Four. On April 3, 2017, Final Four MOP Joel Berry II scored 22 points as UNC beat Gonzaga, 71\u201365, to give Williams his 3rd national championship, surpassing mentor Dean Smith for NCAA Tournament championships. Just as in the previous year, the Tar Heels finished with a 33\u20137 overall record and a 14\u20134 ACC record.\nIn 2017\u201318, the Tar Heels were ranked at No. 9 in the AP and Coaches poll. Forwards Isaiah Hicks, Kennedy Meeks, Tony Bradley, and Justin Jackson had left, while the team added Cameron Johnson. This season, the team did not win the ACC regular season or tournament title. However, the Heels earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament and ended the season 26\u201311 after being eliminated by Texas A&M in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament.\nIn the 2018\u201319 season, the Tar Heels were led by freshman point guard Coby White, and seniors Luke Maye and Cameron Johnson. The Tar Heels were co-ACC regular season champions with Virginia, earned another Number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and made it to the Sweet Sixteen round before being eliminated by the Auburn Tigers.\n2019\u201320 was an unusually down year for the Tar Heels, only winning 14 games and being swept by arch-rival Duke in the regular season. Freshman point guard Cole Anthony's knee injury and a lack of depth on the bench proved devastating for the Tar Heels, as they were unable to carry momentum through ACC play, losing several games on last second shots after starting the season 6\u20131. The Tar Heels made it to the second-round of the ACC tournament before losing to Syracuse in what would turn out to be the final ACC tournament game played before the cancellation of the rest of the 2019\u201320 season due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. Williams passed Smith's mark of 879 all-time wins in the COVID-shortened season.\nHeading into the 2020\u201321 season, expectations were high after the lackluster, injury-filled performance of the season prior. Coming into the season with a talented freshman recruiting class, the Tar Heels looked to rebound from their 14\u201319 record. Senior Garrison Brooks was picked as the preseason ACC Player of the Year yet failed to live up to the preseason hype. Sophomore forward Armando Bacot led the Tar Heels in scoring, and the emergence of freshman Kerwin Walton provided the Tar Heels with an outside shooter that had been missing on the previous year's team. However, the Heels stumbled out of the starting block, beginning conference play with an 0\u20132 record in the ACC. However, the Tar Heels rebounded, and returned the favor to the Blue Devils, sweeping them in the two regular season matchups. Freshman guard Caleb Love scored 25 points and 7 assists against Duke in Durham, breaking an at-Duke assist record set by Ty Lawson in 2009. On February 27, 2021, Williams earned his 900th career victory as a head coach against Florida State, becoming the fastest coach to reach that mark, over the fewest number of games. The Tar Heels finished with a record of 18\u201311, losing to Wisconsin in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nOn April 1, 2021, Roy Williams announced his retirement as the head coach of the Tar Heels after 48 years in coaching and 33 years as a collegiate head coach, 18 of which came at the helm of his alma mater. Williams ended his coaching career with 903 career wins, 485 of which came at Carolina, and three national championships, all as the Tar Heel head coach. At the time of his retirement, Williams was third all-time in NCAA Division I victories. Williams is the first coach to earn 400 or more wins at two different schools. Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham announced that evening that a search for the next head coach would begin immediately, with the search being headed up by Cunningham and UNC-Chapel Hill chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz.\n\nHubert Davis (2021\u2013present)\nFour days after Williams retired, assistant coach and former Tar Heel player Hubert Davis was hired as his successor. Davis, the nephew of Tar Heel and NBA great Walter Davis, became the first African-American to lead the program. After an up-and-down start to the regular season that included some blowout losses, Davis' Tar Heels turned a corner in the latter part of ACC conference play. With a 70\u201363 victory against Louisville on February 21, 2022, Davis reached 20 wins in his first season as head coach. The team coupled the renewed energy and intensity with a shock 94\u201381 upset victory over Duke in Mike Krzyzewski's final home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium. The Tar Heels earned an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament and upset the defending champions and 1 seeded Baylor 93-86 in the second round, despite the ejection of UNC forward Brady Manek due to a flagrant-2 foul. The Tar Heels defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen and Saint Peter's in the Elite Eight to earn a trip to the 2022 Final Four in New Orleans. In a rematch of the regular season finale against Duke, the Tar Heels defeated Duke 81\u201377 in the national semifinal in Mike Krzyzewski's final game as a head coach. The Tar Heels faced the Kansas Jayhawks in the National Championship game, during which they were unable to capitalize on a double-digit halftime lead and were defeated by a final score of 72\u201369, finishing the season as National Runner-Up.  The team was preseason #1 the following season but never could find much consistency finishing with a disappointing 20\u201313 record and declining an NIT bid.  Because of this, they became the first preseason #1 team to miss the tournament since it expanded to 64 teams in 1985.  After Caleb Love and others decided to transfer after the season, Davis looked to the transfer portal to improve the team's fortunes.  They landed Harrison Ingram from Stanford University, and Cormac Ryan, a graduate transfer student from Notre Dame University, while also landing Elliot Cadeau, who was considered the top point guard in the class of 2024.  The changes in personnel definitely helped as the Tar Heels finished the regular season 25-6 and atop the ACC standings at 17-3 for their 33rd conference title in school history.  Along with sweeping their archrivals, Duke Blue Devils Hubert Davis was voted ACC coach of the year while senior RJ Davis was voted ACC player of the year. The next season, despite some returning players, strong early expectations, and talented recruits, the Tar Heels finished 23-14 overall and tied for fourth in the ACC with a 13-7 conference record. They fell to the Duke Blue Devils in the ACC Tournament semifinals and were selected as an 11-seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they won a First Four game against the San Diego State Aztecs but were eliminated in the First Round by the Ole Miss Rebels. During the offseason, Davis hired Jim Tanner as the first General Manager in program history and presented him with a guaranteed five-year contract.\n\nThe Carolina Way\nDean Smith was widely known for his idea of \"The Carolina Way\", in which he challenged his players to \"Play hard, play smart, play together\". \"The Carolina Way\" was an idea of excellence in the classroom, as well as on the court. In Coach Smith's book The Carolina Way, former player Scott Williams said, regarding Dean Smith: \"Winning was very important at Carolina, and there was much pressure to win, but Coach cared more about our getting a sound education and turning into good citizens than he did about winning.\" \"The Carolina Way\" was evident in many practices the players would implement, including pointing to the player who assisted in a basket, giving him credit as an act of selflessness. This \"Thank the Passer\" practice is used throughout basketball today.\n\nStreaks\nThe Tar Heels own several notable streaks in the history of college basketball. They appeared in either the NCAA Tournament or National Invitation Tournament (NIT) every year from 1967 to 2001. This includes 27 straight appearances in the NCAA tourney from 1975 (the first year that more than one team in each conference was assured of a tournament bid) to 2001\u2014the longest such streak in tournament history until it was broken by Kansas in March 2017. The Tar Heels also notched 37 straight winning seasons from 1964 to 2001, the third-longest such streak in NCAA history, behind UCLA's streak of 54 consecutive winning seasons from 1948 to 2001, and Syracuse's streak of 46 seasons.  They also finished .500 or better for 39 years in a row from 1962 (Dean Smith's second year) to 2001, the third-longest such streak in NCAA history, behind Kentucky's streak of 61 consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1988 (the Wildcats were barred from playing in 1952\u201353 due to NCAA violations) and UCLA's 54-season streak.\nFrom the ACC's inception in 1953 to 2001, the Tar Heels did not finish worse than a tie for fourth place in ACC play. By comparison, all of the ACC's other charter members finished last at least once in that time.  From 1965 to 2001, they did not finish worse than a tie for third, and for the first 21 of those years they did not finish worse than a tie for second.\nAll of these streaks ended in the 2001\u201302 season, when the Tar Heels finished 8\u201320 on the season under coach Matt Doherty. They also finished tied for 7th in conference play, behind Florida State and Clemson\u2014only their second losing conference record ever (the first being in the ACC's inaugural season).\nAdditionally, the Tar Heels went 59\u20130 all-time in home games played against the Clemson Tigers (the NCAA record for the longest home winning streak against a single opponent). The Tar Heels' all-time home winning streak against Clemson lasted until the 2019\u20132020 season where Clemson stunned the Tar Heels in overtime, 79\u201376. Until the 2010 ACC tournament, North Carolina was the only program to have never played a Thursday game in the ACC tournament since it expanded to a four-day format.\nThe Tar Heels have three stretches of being ranked for more than 100 consecutive weeks in the AP Poll. They spent 172 consecutive weeks in the rankings from the start of the 1990\u201391 season until early in the 1999\u20132000 season, the second-longest streak in college basketball history at the time behind only UCLA's run of 231 consecutive weeks from 1966 to 1980. That streak has since been passed by Duke's run of 200 consecutive weeks from 1997 to 2007 and Kansas' 231 consecutive weeks from 2009 to 2021. They were also ranked for 171 consecutive weeks from 1973 to 1983, and for 106 consecutive weeks from 2014 to 2020.\n\nBy the numbers\nAll-time wins \u2013 2,372\nAll-time winning Percentage \u2013 .734\nNCAA championships \u2013 6\nNCAA Tournament runner-up \u2013 6\nAll-Americans \u2013 49 players chosen 78 times\nACC regular season titles \u2013 33\nACC Tournament titles \u2013 18\nNCAA championship games \u2013 12\nNCAA Final Fours \u2013 21 (most all-time)\nNCAA Tournament appearances \u2013 52\nNCAA Tournament wins \u2013 133 (most all-time)\nNo. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament \u2013 18\nNumber of weeks ranked all-time in the top 25 of the AP Poll \u2013 953\nNumber of times defeating the No. 1 ranked team in the country \u2013 14\n\nVictories over AP No. 1 team\nNorth Carolina has 14 victories over the AP number one ranked team.\n\nJanuary 14, 1959 \u2013 UNC 72, No. 1 NC State 68\nJanuary 12, 1980 \u2013 No. 15 UNC 82, No. 1 Duke 67\nNovember 21, 1987 \u2013 UNC 96, No. 1 Syracuse 93\nJanuary 18, 1989 \u2013 No. 13 UNC 91, No. 1 Duke 71\nMarch 17, 1990 \u2013 NR UNC 79, No. 1 Oklahoma, 77\nFebruary 5, 1992 \u2013 No. 9 UNC 75, No. 1 Duke 73\nFebruary 3, 1994 \u2013 No. 2 UNC 89, No. 1 Duke 78\nFebruary 5, 1998 \u2013 No. 2 UNC 97, No. 1 Duke 73\nMarch 8, 1998 \u2013 No. 3 UNC 83, No. 1 Duke 68\nJanuary 17, 2004 \u2013 UNC 86, No. 1 Connecticut 83\nApril 4, 2005 \u2013 No. 2 UNC 75, No. 1 Illinois 70\nMarch 4, 2006 \u2013 No. 13 UNC 83, No. 1 Duke 76\nDecember 4, 2013 \u2013 NR UNC 79, No. 1 Michigan State 65\nFebruary 20, 2019 \u2013 No. 8 UNC 88, No. 1 Duke 72\n\nHonored and retired jerseys\nRetired numbers\nEight players (including Jack Cobb, whose jersey did not have a number) have had their numbers retired.

It was built to replace the old memorabilia room in the Dean Smith Center. Designed by Gallagher & Associates, the cost of construction was $3.4 million. The museum opened in January 2008.\n\nUNC junior varsity basketball team\nThe UNC junior varsity basketball team was originally used at North Carolina as freshmen teams because freshmen were not allowed to play on the varsity team until the NCAA granted freshmen eligibility in the Fall of 1972.\nAfter most schools decided to disband their J.V. squads, North Carolina's athletic department opted to keep the team so that non-scholarship students were given the chance to play basketball for UNC. North Carolina also uses their J.V. team as a way for varsity assistant coaches to gain experience as head coaches, such as the current coach, Hubert Davis.

    "summary": "The North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program is a college basketball team of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels have won six NCAA championships (1957, 1982, 1993, 2005, 2009, and 2017) in addition to a 1924 Helms Athletic Foundation title (retroactive). North Carolina has won a record 134 NCAA tournament matchups while advancing to 31 Sweet Sixteen berths (since 1975), a record 21 Final Fours, and 12 title games. It is the only school to have an active streak of reaching the National Championship game for nine straight decades (no other school has done it in more than six straight) and at least two Final Fours for six straight decades, all while averaging more wins per season played (20.7) than any other program in college basketball. In 2012, ESPN ranked North Carolina No. 1 on its list of the 50 most successful programs of the past fifty years.\nNorth Carolina's six national championships are tied with UConn for third-most all-time, behind UCLA (11) and Kentucky (8). UNC has also won eighteen Atlantic Coast Conference tournament (ACC) titles, and thirty-three ACC regular season titles. The program has produced many notable players who went on to play in the NBA, including four of ESPN's top 74 players of all-time: Michael Jordan, James Worthy, Vince Carter, and Bob McAdoo (tied for most with UCLA). Many Tar Heel assistant coaches and players have gone on to become head coaches elsewhere.\nFrom the Tar Heels' first season in 1910\u201311 through the start of the 2021\u201322 season, the program has amassed a .735 all-time winning percentage (second highest all-time), winning 2,294 games and losing 829 games in 111-plus seasons. The Tar Heels also have the most consecutive 20-win seasons, with 31 from the 1970\u201371 season through the 2000\u201301 season. On March 2, 2010, North Carolina became the second college basketball program to reach 2,000 wins in its history. The Tar Heels are currently 3rd all-time in wins. The Tar Heels are one of only four Division I men's basketball programs to have achieved 2,000 victories. Kentucky, Kansas, and Duke are the other three.\nCarolina has played 182 games in the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels have appeared in the NCAA Tournament championship game twelve times, and have been in a record 21 NCAA Tournament Final Fours. The Tar Heels have been selected to the NCAA Tournament 53 times (second-most all-time), and have amassed 133 victories (most all-time). North Carolina won the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1971, and has appeared in two NIT Finals with six appearances in the NIT Tournament. Additionally, the team has been the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament eighteen times, the latest being in 2024 (most No. 1 seeds all-time).\nNorth Carolina has been ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll an all-time record 927 weeks, has beaten AP No. 1 ranked teams 14 times, has the most 25-win seasons with 38, and has the most consecutive top-three ACC regular season finishes with 37. North Carolina has ended the season ranked in the top 25 of the AP Poll 51 times and in the top 25 of the Coaches' Poll 53 times. Furthermore, the Tar Heels have finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll six times and ranked No. 1 in Coaches' Poll seven times. In 2008, the Tar Heels received the first unanimous preseason No. 1 ranking in the history of either the Coaches' Poll or the AP Poll.",

  "North Texas Mean Green": {
    "biography": "The North Texas Mean Green men's basketball team represents the University of North Texas (UNT) in NCAA Division I college basketball, competing as a member of the American Athletic Conference.\nFor most of its history, the Mean Green have had patches of success, starting in the 1970s when the team received its first top-20 ranking under head coach Bill Blakeley as well as success in the late 1980s and early 1990s under head coach Jimmy Gales and then again in the mid to late 2000s under head coach Johnny Jones. Blakeley coached three consecutive 20-win seasons: 1975\u201376 (22-4); 1976\u201377 (21-6); 1977\u201378 (22-6).  North Texas has appeared in the NCAA tournament on four occasions: 1988, 2007, 2010, and 2021, recording their first-ever tournament win in 2021. The Mean Green went on an especially strong run in the 2006\u20132010 era, with two tournament appearances, two conference championships, and posting more wins over this time period than any other Division I team in the state of Texas.\nThe 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 teams featured the only 5-star recruit to play for North Texas in Tony Mitchell. In one season, he became the program's all-time leader in blocks. Despite Mitchell being highly touted, his performance in his second year suffered and he ended up struggling under new head coach Tony Benford eventually falling to the 2nd round of the NBA draft.\nOn April 16, 2012, longtime head coach Johnny Jones was formally introduced as the next head coach of his alma mater LSU. His replacement, Tony Benford, was not able to capitalize on the program's momentum, resulting in a disappointing final year in the Sun Belt Conference and then more struggles in the Mean Green's new conference Conference USA.\nPrior to 1973, the Mean Green played in the Ken Bahnsen Gym, nicknamed the Snake Pit. They now play in The Super Pit which derives its name from the Snake Pit.\n\nRivals\nWhile the Mean Green hold a fierce rivalry with the UTSA Roadrunners across athletics in general, the team's most contentious conference rivals in men's basketball currently are the UAB Blazers and FAU Owls. In 2023, the Mean Green and Blazers met four times in which UNT won the series, 3-1. The Blazers knocked the Mean Green out of the Conference USA tournament while the Mean Green defeated the Blazers in the 2023 NIT Championship. During the Grant McCasland era, there was also a stretch where the road team in the series won nine straight games. And while North Texas leads the historical series with FAU, a 2023 Final Four participant, 14-11, the Mean Green have dropped five straight games against the Owls by a combined 21 points, including a 77-71 loss in the 2024 AAC tournament.\nThe Mean Green briefly restored their rivalry with the SMU Mustangs the one year they shared in the AAC (2023-24), with the home team winning both matchups by an average of 2.5 points. It is unclear if the teams will continue the series once the Mustangs enter the ACC in 2024-25. The teams have only played 19 times since 1949-50.\nNotable Non-conference rivals include the University of Texas at Arlington Mavericks, and former Conference USA foes Louisiana Tech, Middle Tennessee, and Western Kentucky.\n\nCoaches\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Mean Green have appeared in the NCAA tournament four times.

    "biography": "The Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team representing Northwestern University in the Big Ten Conference. Men's basketball was introduced at Northwestern in 1901. Since 2013, the team has been coached by Chris Collins. The Wildcats have advanced to the NCAA tournament three times, in 2017, 2023, and 2024, after being the only longstanding member of a Power Five conference to have never made the tournament. The Wildcats have won two Big Ten conference championships (1931 and 1933).\n\nHistory\nNorthwestern began its inaugural season of intercollegiate play in 1904\u201305, losing its first game to the University of Chicago 19\u201334. They went 2\u20132 in their first season, losing to the University of Chicago twice, and defeating Beloit and Iowa.\nAlthough Northwestern had great success in the early 20th century, it has spent most of the time since World War II in the bottom half of the Big Ten. The Wildcats were retroactively selected as the 1930\u201331 national champion by both the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll, and have won only one other conference title, in 1933. It has only finished better than fourth place twice since World War II, and did not have a winning record in conference play from 1968 until 2017. Only the 2003\u201304 team managed a .500 conference record during that time. On March 1, 2017, the Wildcats won their 10th conference game (a 67\u201365 win over Michigan) to clinch their first winning Big Ten record in almost half a century. That season also saw the Wildcats make their first NCAA tournament in school history, winning their first NCAA tournament game 68\u201366 against Vanderbilt. The Wildcats have also appeared in the National Invitation Tournament seven times (1983, 1994, 1999, 2009\u20132012).\nThe first NCAA tournament championship was held at Northwestern in March 1939. Until making their first NCAA tournament in 2017, Northwestern had been one of five original NCAA Division I schools and the only school from a power conference to have never played an NCAA tournament game. Northwestern won its first tournament game, defeating Vanderbilt 68\u201366. The Wildcats lost in the second round to No. 1-seeded Gonzaga.\nIn 1998, two former players were charged and convicted for sports bribery, having been paid to shave points in games against three other Big Ten schools during the 1995 season.\nThe 2022\u201323 team finished in a tie for second place in the Big Ten regular season, its best finish in the conference since the 1958\u201359 season.\n\nCoaching history\nSources:\n\nPostseason\nNCAA Division I tournament results\nThe Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA tournament three times.

    "biography": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish Men's Basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, United States. The program competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference of NCAA Division I. On September 12, 2012, Notre Dame announced they would be moving to the Atlantic Coast Conference; they joined the conference on July 1, 2013.\nThe school holds two retroactively awarded national championships in basketball from the Helms Foundation: for the 1927 (19\u20131 overall record) and 1936 (22\u20132\u20131 overall record) seasons. They have also played in the NCAA tournament 36 times, good for 9th all time, and reached the Final Four in 1978. The Irish hold the record for most Tournament appearances without a championship or championship game appearance, one of five teams (along with Texas, Temple, Illinois and Oklahoma) to have 30 or more appearances without a title and one of three teams (along with Texas and Temple) to have more than 30 appearances without either. They are also the first Big East team to go undefeated at home two straight seasons.\nThe Fighting Irish play their home games in the Purcell Pavilion at the Edmund P. Joyce Center. Since moving to the Purcell Pavilion in 1968, they have had 44 winning seasons at the Purcell Pavilion, including 5 undefeated seasons at home (1973, 1985, 2006, 2007, and 2010) and have had only 4 losing seasons at the Purcell Pavilion (1971, 1981, 1992, and 1995).

Both wins over UCLA were in seasons immediately following UCLA claiming the NCAA Championship with the 1971 win coming over a team that would be the eventual tournament champion.  The 1954 win in the NCAA tournament over Indiana prevented IU from back-to-back national titles after claiming the 1953 NCAA Tournament Title.  The 1978 win over Marquette was another instance of the Irish defeating the defending national champion.  The 1948 win over Kentucky saw the Irish defeat the eventual Tournament champion who would go on to win both the 1948 and 1949 titles. The 1948 win over NYU was a victory over the eventual NIT runner-up, in a time where the prestige of the NIT tournament rivaled that of the NCAA tournament.\nAlso of note is that the 2005 win over Boston College and the 2012 win over Syracuse saw 20\u20130 teams traveling to South Bend and leaving with their first loss of the season.  Boston College, in its final year as a member of the Big East, set the record for most consecutive wins by a Big East team to start a season.  The 2012 Syracuse team began the game against the Irish with the goal of breaking Boston College's record.  As in 2005, the Irish defeated Syracuse and cemented their place as the streak stopper.\n\nNotes\n\nCoaches\nCurrent coaching staff\nHead Coach \u2013 Micah Shrewsberry\nAssociate Head Coach \u2013 Kyle Getter\nAssistant Coach \u2013 Mike Farrelly\nAssistant Coach \u2013 Ryan Owens\nAssistant Coach \u2013 Tre Whitted\nAssistant Coach \u2013 Grady Eifert\nGeneral Manager \u2013 Pat Garrity\n\nAll-time coaching records\nPlayers\nCurrent roster\nRoster is subject to change as/if players transfer or leave the program for other reasons.\n\nACC and Big East Awards\nNational awards\nCoaching awards\nNational Coach of the Year\n\nDigger Phelps (1974) (UPI), (1987) (Basketball Weekly)\nMike Brey (2011) (AP, Henry Iba Award, CBS Sports.com, Sports Illustrated), (2012) (Jim Phelan Coach of the Year Award)\nSkip Prosser Man of the Year Award\n\nMike Brey (2008)\nNational Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District V Coach of the Year\n\nMike Brey (2011, 2012)\n\nPlayer awards\nNational Players of the Year\n\nJohn Moir (1936) \u2013 Helms\nAustin Carr (1971) \u2013 AP, UPI, Helms(shared)\nAdrian Dantley (1976) \u2013 U.S. Basketball Writers Association\nNational Freshman of the Year\n\nChris Thomas (2002) \u2013 Basketball Times, Basketball News\nAcademic All-American First Team\n\nTim Abromaitis (2010, 2011)\nFirst Team All-American\nNotre Dame leads all schools with 3 of the 18 total 3-time Consensus All-American selections.\n\nRaymond Scanlon (1909)\nNoble Kizer (1925)\nJohn Nyikos (1927)\nMoose Krause (1932, 1933, 1934)\nJohn Moir (1936, 1937, 1938)\nPaul Nowak (1936, 1937, 1938)\nLeo Klier (1944, 1946)\nBilly Hassett (1945)\nKevin O'Shea (1948)\nAustin Carr (1971)\nJohn Shumate (1974)\nAdrian Dantley (1975, 1976)\nTroy Murphy (2000, 2001)\nJerian Grant (2015)\nSecond Team All-American\n\nBob Rensberger (1943)\nBilly Hassett (1946)\nKevin O'Shea (1950)\nTom Hawkins (1959)\nAustin Carr (1970)\nKelly Tripucka (1979, 1981)\nJohn Paxson (1982, 1983)\nPat Garrity (1998)\nLuke Harangody (2008, 2009, 2010)\nBen Hansbrough (2011)\nJohn Wooden All-Americans\n\nTroy Murphy (2000, 2001)\nLuke Harangody (2008)\nNIT MVP\n\nJohn Shumate (1973)\nFor a complete list of yearly all-Americans, see: 2007\u201308 Notre Dame Men's Basketball Media Guide pages 176\u2013179 (PDF copy available at 2007\u201308 Men's Basketball Guide)\n\nNaismith Basketball Hall of Fame\nGeorge Keogan (1961)\nElmer Ripley (1973)\nMoose Krause (1976)\nAdrian Dantley (2008)\n\nFighting Irish currently in the NBA\nPat Connaughton \u2013 Charlotte Hornets\nMatt Ryan \u2013 Free agent\nBlake Wesley \u2013 Portland Trail Blazers\n\nFighting Irish currently in other leagues\nTim Abromaitis \u2013 CB Canarias (Liga ACB)\nMatt Allocco \u2013 San Diego Clippers (NBA G League)\nPaul Atkinson \u2013 Free agent\nZach Auguste \u2013 Shiga Lakes (B.League)\nBonzie Colson \u2013 Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.

  "Oakland Golden Grizzlies": {
    "biography": "The Oakland Golden Grizzlies men's basketball team represents Oakland University in Auburn Hills, Michigan, United States. The school's team competes in the Horizon League and plays their home games at the Athletics Center O'rena. The Golden Grizzlies are coached by Greg Kampe. Kampe is the longest-tenured active Division I head coach. Oakland last played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2024.\nThrough the 2022\u201323 season, Oakland has made a three-point field goal in 1,093 consecutive games, the fourth-longest active NCAA Division I streak. They last finished a game without a three-pointer on January 30, 1988.\n\nHistory\nThe Oakland men's basketball program began competing in the 1967 season, 10 years after the university opened. Originally nicknamed the Pioneers, they won their first NCAA game 109\u2013106 in overtime against Albion. The Pioneers were without a conference until 1974 when they joined the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC).\nThe first year as members of the GLIAC, Oakland hired Greg Kampe, who is still the head coach at the university. Kampe had the fifth-longest tenure of all active Division I coaches, as of 2012. Oakland won two regular season GLIAC championships, in 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397, their final two seasons in the league. In a 1993 game against Madonna, Oakland scored 91 points in the first half, on their way to a 189\u2013107 victory. That game set school records for most points in a half (98) and largest margin of victory (82). The next three seasons, OU scored more than 100 points 30 times, winning 29 of those games.\nOakland played at the Division II level until 1997 when they changed their nickname to the Golden Grizzlies and began the transition to Division I. OU opened the Athletics Center O'rena in 1998 against Michigan State. When the O'rena was being built, home basketball games were played in the Sports Dome, an inflatable \"bubble\" used for practice by Oakland's athletic teams during the winter. The original basketball stadium was in the Hollie L. Lepley Sports Center.\nThe Golden Grizzlies completed the transition to Division I in 1999 and joined the Mid-Continent Conference (now known as The Summit League).\nThe Golden Grizzlies joined the Horizon League starting in the 2013\u201314 season.\nIn 2021, The Golden Grizzlies lose their 1,000 day streak of winning against Detroit Mercy.\nIn 2022, Oakland looks to build upon this game to challenge for its first Horizon League trophy since 2017.\nIn the 2023-24 season, the Golden Grizzlies won the Horizon League Tournament for the first time, securing an automatic bid to that season's NCAA Tournament. In the Round of 64, the 14th seeded Golden Grizzlies upset #3 Kentucky, 80-76, shocking the country and sending shockwaves throughout the tournament. Senior transfer Jack Gohlke caught the nation's eye with 10 three-pointers in the game, ending with 32 points. Kampe labelled it the \"biggest win of (his) career\" in post-game interviews.\n\nConference affiliation\nThe Golden Grizzlies first joined a Division I conference in 1998 when they joined the Mid-Continent Conference (now known as the Summit League). Oakland joined the Horizon League July 1, 2013.\n\nNotes\n\nPostseason history\nOakland competed in NCAA Division II since the inception of the basketball program in 1967 until they moved to NCAA Division I in 1997. The Golden Grizzlies reached the Division II postseason four times in their final four seasons at that level.\n\nNCAA Division I Tournament results\nThe Golden Grizzlies have appeared in four Division I NCAA Tournaments.

Both schools first played against each other in 1985 with Detroit Mercy winning the first matchup against Oakland 77\u201362. Oakland won the last matchup in 2023 65\u201350.\n\nRecords\nMedia\nOU men's basketball games are broadcast on WDFN (1130 AM).

Oakland home games are simulcast on ESPN3, WMYD and WDFN.\nMario Impemba, also the play-by-play commentator for the Detroit Tigers on Fox Sports Detroit, broadcast Oakland games from 2006\u20132013.\n\nOakland players who played in the NBA\nKeith Benson\nJamal Cain\nKay Felder\nRawle Marshall\nKendrick Nunn\n\nFootnotes\na The official Oakland record book lists Reggie Hamilton in third place with 548 career assists from 2010\u20132012. That includes the assists he accumulated while at UMKC from 2007\u20132009, which is inconsistent with how the rest of the record book handles transfer player statistics.\nb The official Oakland record book lists Marshall's total at 199, but the addition of his individual season's statistics makes the total 198 (80 in 2002\u201303, 59 in 2003\u201304, 59 in 2004\u201305).\nc There is a discrepancy between sources for Brock's 2016\u201317 season block total. The official Oakland record book lists 72, while other sources list the total as 69. This is due to a difference in total blocks for the December 10, 2016, game against Robert Morris. Both school box scores list 7 blocks while ESPN and sports-reference.com list 5.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

  "Ohio Bobcats": {
    "biography": "The Ohio Bobcats men's basketball team is an intercollegiate varsity sports program of Ohio University. The team is a member of the Mid-American Conference competing in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Bobcats have played their home games in the Convocation Center since 1968.\nThe first Ohio basketball game occurred in 1907 when the Bobcats defeated the Parkersburg YMCA 46\u20139. Through the 2022\u201323 season, Ohio has posted a .574 winning percentage over its 117-year history and a .561 winning percentage in its 78 years in the Mid-American Conference. The Bobcats have won seven Mid-American Conference tournament titles (1983, 1985, 1994, 2005, 2010, 2012, and 2021), as well as 10 MAC regular-season titles (1960, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1970, 1972, 1974, 1985, 1994 and 2013). Prior to joining the MAC, the Bobcats won an Ohio Athletic Conference title in 1921 and three Buckeye Athletic Association championships (1931, 1933, and 1937). In addition, Ohio has played in the NCAA tournament 14 times (second most in the MAC), appearing in 1960, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1970, 1972, 1974, 1983, 1985, 1994, 2005, 2010, 2012, and 2021. The Bobcats have been selected for the National Invitation Tournament five times: in 1941 (runner-up), 1969, 1986, 1995, and 2013. Ohio also appeared in the College Basketball Invitational in 2008, 2016, and 2022 and the CollegeInsider.com Tournament in 2011 and 2014. The program was ranked 86th in Street & Smith's 100 Greatest Basketball Programs of All Time, published in 2005.\n\nHistory\nThe first intercollegiate men's basketball game involving an Ohio University team was played in Athens in 1907 against the Parkersburg YMCA. Under the direction of coach James Jones, the Bobcats won the game by a score of 46\u20139 and continued their victories with a 5-game winning streak to start the season.  The 'Cats would go on to lose 4 games that season and earn a 7\u20134 record.\nCoach Jones would only be at Ohio for two more seasons, leading the team to records of 1\u20131 in the 1908\u201309 campaign and 2\u20135 during the 1909\u201310 season.  Over the next three seasons, the basketball program was in a state of flux, with a new coach taking over the reins every year.  Ohio joined the Ohio Athletic Conference in 1911, and started out poorly under coach Arthur Hinaman with a 2\u20139 record.\nA bit of stability arrived to Athens with the hiring of coach Mark Banks in 1913. Banks would lead the program to a 3\u201310 season in his first year, but the 'Cats surged to 11\u20134 in Bank's second year at the helm.   That 1914\u20131915 squad beat the Cincinnati Bearcats and the Miami Redskins twice, while also impressively defeating Wooster by a score of 51\u201320.  Banks teams would fall off over the next several seasons, with the low point being a 2\u201314 mark in the 1916\u20131917 campaign.  Banks would coach only one more year, with the Bobcats posting a 4\u20138 record in the 1918\u20131919 season.\nBank's successor was Frank Gullum, who in his two years at the helm was 5\u20134 and 5\u20136, respectively. Gullum was succeeded by Russell Finsterwald, who led the team to an outstanding 15\u20132 season in his first year at the helm. That 1920\u20131921 team defeated the Miami Redskins and Cincinnati Bearcats each twice, and also earned Ohio's first Ohio Athletic Association title.  Finsterwald's 1921\u20131922 squad was equally impressive, posting a 19\u20134 mark with two wins against the Bowling Green Falcons.  Though Finsterwald would only last these two seasons, his work cannot be underestimated in steering the 'Cats towards a legacy of success.\n\n1922\u20131949: The Grover-Trautwein era\nButch Grover took the reins of the Ohio program in 1922, and led the team to a newfound level of success.  His inaugural 1922\u20131923 season was marked by an 11\u20138 record, and wins over teams such as the Cincinnati Bearcats and the Marietta Pioneers.  In 1923-24, the Bobcats marked their move into the brand new Men's Gymnasium with a 16\u20135 record and a near miss of an Ohio Athletic Conference title.  Several winning seasons later, the Bobcats moved into the Buckeye Athletic Association in 1926 and started off with an 8\u201313 mark in the 1926\u20131927 season. Ohio won its first Buckeye Athletic Association title during the 1930\u201331 season with a 12\u20134 mark.  Just two seasons later in 1933\u20131934, the Bobcats won another Buckeye Athletic Association championship with a 16\u20134 record and two wins over the archrival Miami Redskins.  The 1936\u20131937 season marked Grover's third and final Buckeye Athletic Association championship. The Bobcats were 18\u20133 that year, and earned wins over programs such as Xavier and Dayton.\nWilliam J. \"Dutch\" Trautwein took over the Bobcat basketball program in 1938.  He led the team to 12\u20138 and 19\u20136 records in his first and second seasons.  In the 1940\u201341 season, the team earned a record of 18\u20134, and was selected for the National Invitation Tournament after a season which included wins over Xavier, Akron, Toledo, Cincinnati, and archrival Miami.  With the play of Frank Baumholtz, the Bobcats finished as runners-up in the tournament to perennial power Long Island University. Baumholtz, known as the \"Midvale Marvel\", earned tournament MVP honors and All-American status for his NIT performance. Following his Ohio career, he became one of a few to play two professional sports \u2013 basketball with the Cleveland Rebels in 1946\u201347 and baseball with the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, and Philadelphia Phillies over a 10-year career.\nAfter several more winning seasons under Trautwein, the Bobcats undertook a new challenge in 1946 when they joined the new Mid-American Conference.  The 'Cats were 13\u201310 in their first year in the MAC, and followed that up with a 10\u201310 mark in the 1947\u20131948 season. The 1948\u20131949 season was Trautwein's last, with the team compiling a 6\u201316 record.\n\n1949\u20131974: Jim Snyder\nOhio alumnus Jim Snyder took over for Trautwein in 1949. Ohio's winningest coach, dubbed \"Gentleman Jim\", guided the Bobcats for a quarter century. With star players like Jim Betts, Bunk Adams, Jerry Jackson, Don Hilt, Gerald McKee and Sports Illustrated cover boy Walter Luckett, Snyder won a total of seven MAC titles. His teams made seven NCAA appearances and finished with a winning record 21 times in 25 years.\nSnyder's first season was rather lackluster, with the 'Cats posting a 6\u201314 record.  He followed that up with a slight improvement in the 1950\u20131951 season and a 13\u201311 mark.  The 1954\u20131955 season was a breakout year for Ohio, and the team earned a 16\u20135 record and key wins over Morehead State and Miami University.  In 1960, Ohio won its first championship under Snyder, with the team taking the MAC by way of a 10\u20132 league record (17\u20138 overall).  That squad defeated the likes of the Toledo Rockets, Bowling Green Falcons, and Miami Redskins en route to a 74\u201366 win over Notre Dame in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nThe 1959\u20131960 championship team was quickly followed up by another title in the very next year. The 1960\u20131961 team celebrated its move into the brand new Grover Center with a stunning 10\u20132 league record (17\u20137 overall), including a first-place finish at the Canton Intercollegiate Tournament. A few years later, the 1963\u20131964 team made its mark as perhaps the best in Ohio history.  That team won the MAC title with a 10\u20132 league mark, and followed it up with NCAA tournament wins over the Louisville Cardinals and the No. 4 Kentucky Wildcats.  Snyder's 'Cats ultimately lost to the No. 2 Michigan Wolverines in the \"Elite Eight\".\nThough the 1963\u20131964 team produced a record that was hard to top, the 1964\u20131965 edition did its best to compete with the previous year's squad. They posted an 11\u20131 MAC record and a 19\u20137 overall mark, though fell to Dayton in the first round of the NCAA tournament.  Snyder's teams would go through a slight drought until the 1968\u20131969 season, when they open up the Convocation Center with a win over the Indiana Hoosiers and subsequent postseason NIT appearance and a 17\u20139 record. The very next season, Ohio scored wins over No. 16 Ohio State and No. 13 Purdue and achieved a midseason #5 national ranking while marching their way to another MAC championship before losing in the NCAA tournament to Notre Dame.\nThe Bobcats won another MAC title under Snyder in the 1971\u20131972 season. Though the 'Cats were just 15\u201311 that year, they were 7\u20133 in the MAC with wins over the No. 12 Indiana Hoosiers and the No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes.  Snyder's Bobcats won a final MAC title in the 1973\u20131974 season, with a 16\u201311 record and wins over the Penn State Nittany Lions and the Ohio State Buckeyes.\n\n1974\u20131989\nJim Snyder was immediately succeeded by his assistant Dale Bandy, who struggled to a 69\u201389 record over his six-year tenure at Ohio.  Bandy was replaced by Danny Nee in 1980, with the Bobcats beginning a road back to prominence.  His teams \u2013 led by the likes of John Devereaux, Robert Tatum, Paul Baron, John Rhodes, Eddie Hicks and Vic Alexander \u2013tallied four consecutive 20-win seasons from 1983 to 1986.  The 1982-83 team won the MAC Tournament title with a subsequent win in the NCAA tournament.  In 1985 the Bobcats won both the MAC regular season and tournament but lost to Kansas in the NCAA tournament.  The 1986 team finished with an NIT matchup in the Convo versus the Ohio State Buckeyes.\nNee left in 1986 to coach the Nebraska Cornhuskers, with Billy Hahn taking over the reins.  His teams were led by future NBA players Paul \"Snoopy\" Graham and Dave Jamerson, two of Ohio's three 2,000-point scorers. Jamerson's 31.2 points per-game average in 1989\u201390 included a Convo-record 60-point win over the University of Charleston.\n\n1989\u20132001: Larry Hunter\nDespite offensive stars, Hahn's teams struggled on the court.  Hahn was replaced in 1989 by Larry Hunter, an Ohio alum who would lead the Bobcats throughout the 1990s. Forward Gary Trent joined Graham and Jamerson atop the 2,000-point plateau, and was the MAC's only three-time Player of the Year.  Trent teamed with three-point marksman Geno Ford to guide Larry Hunter's Bobcats to a MAC Championship in the 1993\u20131994 season.  Ohio captured the conference tournament that season with an 89\u201366 victory over archrival Miami in the finals on ESPN.\nHunter, who played for Snyder, saw Ohio defeat Ohio State in the Preseason NIT to open the following season. Wins over 14th-ranked Virginia, George Washington and New Mexico State earned the Bobcats a Preseason NIT title and an accompanying national ranking.  That team would go on to post a 24\u201310 (13\u20135 MAC) record, en route to an appearance in the post-season NIT and a win over George Washington University in the first round.\nThe Bobcats would struggle in the next few years under Hunter, with the low point being a 5\u201321 season in the 1997\u20131998 campaign.  Though Hunter's teams would rebound to post 18, 20, and 19 wins over the next three seasons, he was relieved of his duties in 2001 due to a lack of success in the postseason.  His successor would be Tim O'Shea.\n\n2001\u20132008: Tim O'Shea\nA new era in Ohio basketball began in 2001 when Boston College assistant Tim O'Shea became the Bobcats' 15th head coach. His teams featured Patrick Flomo, Brandon Hunter and Steve Esterkamp and saw the creation The Convo's new student section, the O Zone. Hunter was drafted by the Boston Celtics in the second round of the 2003 draft. Esterkamp continues to play professionally overseas as well.\nIn the 2004\u20132005 season Ohio went 13\u20131 in The Convo and won 13 of their final 17 games. The team defeated Marshall, Kent State, and Miami in the preliminary rounds of the MAC tournament before scoring an 80\u201379 overtime victory over Buffalo in the championship to earn an NCAA tournament berth. Despite a second-half comeback against the Southeastern Conference champion Florida, the Bobcats' season ended in the first round.\nThe 2005\u20132006 'Cats proved successful as well, posting a 19\u201311 record with wins over teams such as Rhode Island and Samford, and a close loss to Kentucky.  The 2006\u20132007 team also posted 19 wins, with a final record of 19\u201313. A 20 win campaign was had in the 2007\u20132008 season, including notable non-conference wins over Maryland, St. John's, George Mason, and Bucknell. The team was extended an invite to the College Basketball Invitational, where the Bobcats advanced to the second round.\nOn June 23, 2008, O'Shea announced he was leaving the Bobcats team to become head coach at Bryant University.\n\n2008\u20132012: John Groce\nOn June 27, 2008, former Ohio State associate head coach John Groce was named the 16th head coach in Bobcats history. Groce brought 14 years of assistant coaching experience to Athens, along with a pair of outright Big Ten Conference regular-season titles, two NCAA tournament appearances, a berth in the 2007 NCAA National Championship game and the 2008 NIT title.\nThe Bobcats finished the 2009\u20132010 regular season with a 17\u201314 overall record and a 7\u20139 record in MAC play, earning them the ninth seed in their conference tournament.  They won four straight games in the conference tournament to claim the MAC's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.  Placed into the Midwest region as a 14 seed, Ohio upset 3rd-seeded and 12th ranked Georgetown 97\u201383.  The Bobcats took a 12-point lead into halftime and the Hoyas never got closer than a 7-point deficit the rest of the way.\nAfter a mildly disappointing 2010\u201311 season, resulting in a 19\u201316 record and a 2011 CIT Quarterfinal berth, the Bobcats came back in 2011\u201312, with a 2012 MAC tournament championship. The Bobcats received a No. 13 seed in the Midwest Region of the 2012 NCAA tournament. Like 2010, Ohio pulled off a first round upset, defeating 4th seeded and 13th ranked Michigan 65\u201360, and followed by a 62\u201356 victory over 12th seeded South Florida to advance to their first Sweet Sixteen since 1964. The Bobcats run ended in the Sweet Sixteen, as they fell in overtime to fourth ranked and top seeded North Carolina by a score of 73\u201365.\nAs a result of the teams' success, John Groce was offered and accepted the head coaching position at the University of Illinois on March 28, 2012.\n\n2012\u20132014: Jim Christian\nOn April 3, 2012, Ohio hired former TCU and Kent State coach Jim Christian to replace John Groce. Christian had considerable success in the MAC at the helm of Kent State, eclipsing the 20 win plateau in each of his six seasons.\nIn Christian's first season with the Bobcats, they finished with a 24\u201310 overall record and 14\u20132 in the MAC. Tied for first in the MAC East, the Bobcats were the 2nd seed in the MAC tournament falling to Akron in the championship 65\u201346. Akron was the only MAC opponent the Bobcats had failed to defeat all season. The Bobcats earned a spot in the 2013 National Invitation Tournament but came up short with a 61\u201357 loss to Denver in the first round.\nDuring the 2013\u201314 season, Christian led the Bobcats to a 25\u201312 record making the senior class the winningest class in school history with 97 total wins. Ohio failed to reach the NCAA Tournament, losing to Akron once again in the MAC Tournament. The team received an invitation to participate in the 2014 CIT and reached the quarterfinals losing to VMI 90\u201392.\nOn April 3, 2014, Christian left Ohio and accepted an offer to become the head coach for the Boston College Eagles.\n\n2014\u20132019: Saul Phillips\nOhio hired Saul Phillips to replace Christian as the head coach for the Bobcats on April 6, 2014. Phillips had tremendous success coaching for NDSU the previous 7 years, including a second round NCAA tournament win in 2014 and two Summit League championships in 2009 and 2014. His first season at Ohio was a disappointment as the 2014\u201315 Bobcats finished with a 10\u201320 overall record and only 5 wins in the MAC to put them last place in their division.\nThe 2015\u201316 Bobcats improved to a 23\u201312 overall record and 11\u20137 MAC Conference record giving them the #2 seed in the 2016 MAC tournament. Junior Antonio Campbell was named the 2016 MAC Player of the Year after averaging a double-double throughout the 2015\u201316 season, making him the ninth Ohio Bobcat to receive the award. The Bobcats lost to Buffalo in the semifinal game of the MAC Tournament 74\u201388. The 2015\u201316 team received and accepted an invitation to the 2016 College Basketball Invitational and reached the semifinals but lost to Morehead State.\nPhillips was told he would not return next season on March 13, 2019.\n\n2019\u2013present: Jeff Boals\nOhio hired alumnus Jeff Boals to replace Phillips as the head coach for the Bobcats on March 17, 2019. Boals (pronounced BOWLS) spent the prior three seasons as the head coach at Stony Brook going 55\u201341 overall and 31\u201317 in America East play. The Bobcats went 17-15 in Boals first season with Ohio.  Following the 2019-2020 season, the MAC tournament was cancelled due to the start of the coronavirus pandemic.  The next season Boals lead his 2020-21 team to a 17-8 record including 3 wins in the MAC tournament.  They received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 13 seed in the West region.  There they upset No. 4-seeded Virginia in the First Round before falling to No. 5-seeded Creighton in the Second Round.  The 2021-22 team opened the season 22\u20134 but struggled down the stretch to finish 25\u201310 His 2022-23 team had a lot of roster turnover and slipped to 19\u201314.  His 2023-24 team finished 20\u201313. Entering the 2024-25 season, the Bobcats received 11 of the 12 first place votes to win the MAC but could only post a 16\u201316 record.\n\nSeasonal Results\nSource:\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Bobcats have appeared in 14 NCAA Tournaments.

    "biography": "The Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team represents Ohio State University in NCAA Division I college basketball competition. The Buckeyes are a member of the Big Ten Conference.\nThe Buckeyes play their home games at Value City Arena in the Jerome Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio, which opened in 1998. The official capacity of the center is 19,200. Ohio State ranked 28th in the nation in average home attendance as of the 2016 season.\nThe Buckeyes have won one national championship (1960), been the national runner-up four times, appeared in 10 Final Fours (one additional appearance has been vacated by the NCAA), and appeared in 27 NCAA Tournaments (four other appearances have been vacated).\nThad Matta was named the head coach of Ohio State in 2004 to replace coach Jim O'Brien, who was fired due to NCAA violations which made Ohio State vacate 113 games between 1998 and 2002. On June 5, 2017, after consecutive years of missing the NCAA Tournament, the school announced Matta would not return as head coach after 13 years and 337 wins at Ohio State. On June 9, 2017, the school hired Butler head coach Chris Holtmann as head coach.\nThe program is presently led by Jake Diebler, Holtmann's former assistant coach who was initially hired as an interim coach following Holtmann's firing in 2024.\n\nTeam history\nEarly years and Olsen era (1898\u20131958)\nThe first basketball team at Ohio State University was formed in 1898, playing its first game against East High.  Sparing success followed the Buckeyes throughout their time as an independent school.  In 1912, some 13 years after forming their first basketball team, the Buckeyes joined the Big Nine Conference, which would eventually be known as the Big Ten. At first, the Buckeyes were not able to mount a sustained run, never finishing higher than second in the conference standings[1].  In 1923, Harold Olsen became head coach, launching the longest basketball coaching dynasty for OSU (24 seasons). Olsen began to see success with the Buckeyes' first conference championship during the 1922\u20131923 season.  The Olsen era is also highlighted by appearing in the national championship game for the first NCAA Championship tournament in 1939, where the Buckeyes lost to Oregon 33\u201346.  The Buckeyes would make three more Final Four appearances under Olsen, along with winning five Big Ten championships.  Following Olsen as head coach, Tippy Dye and Floyd Stahl led the Buckeyes.  Not seeing the same amount of success as Olsen did, Dye and Stahl had one NCAA Tournament appearance between them.  With the closing of the 1950s, the Ohio State basketball team was not considered a national powerhouse. But it continued to develop and led to the hiring of a man who would change basketball at Ohio State and bring it national fame.\n\nSuccess and Fred Taylor era (1958\u20131997)\nOf all Buckeye coaches, it was Fred Taylor who would put Ohio State basketball on the map.  With the hiring of Taylor in 1958, not much was expected following an 11\u201311 record during the 1958\u20131959 season.  However, in 1960, the second-year coach, Taylor, and future Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame players Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek led the Buckeyes to their first national championship, defeating California 75\u201355 in the final game.  The 1960 season is the only NCAA Tournament championship that the Buckeyes have claimed. Taylor's team returned to the national championship game in both 1961 and 1962, but they would lose both to in-state foe Cincinnati. The Buckeyes made a total of five tournament appearances during Taylor's 18 seasons tenure, which included four trips to the Final Four (1960, 1961, 1962, 1968). With the departure of his championship team, Taylor began to see teams accustomed to Ohio State basketball of the past.  Taylor's last season at Ohio State in 1976 had the Buckeyes going 6\u201320, their worst record, only to be eclipsed by the team in 1995.  Taylor achieved seven conference titles and an impressive overall winning percentage of over 65%.  Past the Taylor era, Ohio State saw Eldon Miller, Gary Williams, and Randy Ayers take the reins as head coach.  Between 1976 and 1997, the Buckeyes made the NCAA bracket only eight times, while being crowned conference champions only twice.\n\nJim O'Brien (1997\u20132004)\nIn 1997, Jim O'Brien was hired to replace head coach Randy Ayers. During his seven years as head coach, O'Brien drove the team to four 20+ win seasons, two Big Ten regular season co-championships, the 2002 Big Ten tournament championship, and a school record four-consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. Controversy erupted when Ohio State athletic director Andy Geiger fired O'Brien over alleged NCAA rules violations. A two-year NCAA investigation found that player Boban Savovic might have received improper benefits while he played for Ohio State. On March 10, 2006, the NCAA gave Ohio State three years' probation and ordered it to pay back all tournament money earned from 1999\u20132002 when Boban Savovic was on the Buckeyes' roster. In addition, Ohio State was forced to remove all references to team accomplishments by the NCAA directorate from those years including a 1999 visit to the Final Four.\n\nThad Matta era (2004\u20132017)\nThad Matta, former head coach at Butler and Xavier, was hired by Ohio State in July 2004.\nDuring Matta's first season at Ohio State, the Buckeyes compiled a 20\u201312 record, highlighted by a win in the final game of the season over top-ranked Illinois, which was undefeated up until that game. Ohio State was defeated by Wisconsin in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals, and the team was ineligible for further postseason due to self-imposed sanctions related to Jim O'Brien's time at the school. The 2005\u201306 season opened with the Buckeyes 11\u20130 heading into Big Ten play. Ohio State ended the season with a 26\u20136 record and 12\u20134 record in conference, the Buckeyes' first outright Big Ten championship since the 1991\u201392 season. Ohio State lost to Iowa in the Big Ten tournament championship game, but received a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. After a first round win, the Buckeyes lost to No. 7 seed Georgetown 70\u201352 in the second round.\nMatta's 2006\u201307 Ohio State team entered the season with the second-rated recruiting class in the nation, headed by Greg Oden and Mike Conley Jr., and ranked No. 4 in the preseason polls. Ohio State entered conference play with an 11\u20132 record, with the only defeats coming at No. 6 North Carolina and at No. 4 Florida. Ohio State's loss against No. 4 Wisconsin on January 9, 2007, was the last loss of the regular season as the Buckeyes won 14 straight games to end the season with a 27\u20133 record. Ohio State defeated No. 20 Tennessee and No. 2 Wisconsin during this winning streak and ended the season as the top-ranked team in the nation. Ohio State won the Big Ten tournament, defeating Wisconsin 66\u201349 in the championship game, and entered the NCAA tournament as the overall No. 1 seed. Ohio State advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time under Matta after an overtime victory against Xavier, which Matta had previously coached. A one-point victory over Tennessee and a 92\u201376 victory over No. 2 Memphis advanced the Buckeyes to the Final Four. Ohio State defeated Georgetown 67\u201360 in the national semifinal, but lost to Florida 84\u201375 in the national championship game. Oden and Conley both would enter the NBA draft following the season, with Oden being drafted number one overall and Conley going fourth.\n\nThe 2007\u201308 season was a rebuilding one. Ohio State ended the season with a 19\u201312 record, finishing fifth in the Big Ten. It lost to Michigan State in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals and missed out on the NCAA tournament. The Buckeyes did receive a No. 1 seed in the National Invitation Tournament, where Ohio State would defeat Massachusetts 92\u201385 in the championship to take the NIT title.\nOhio State began the 2008\u201309 season with a 9\u20130 record and would finish 20\u20139. Ohio State defeated Wisconsin and No. 7 Michigan State to advance to the Big Ten tournament championship, where the Buckeyes lost to No. 24 Purdue. They received a bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 8 seed, where they lost to No. 9 Siena in the first round.\nThe 2009\u201310 season marked Matta's sixth at Ohio State, with the team entering the season ranked No. 17 in the nation.  The Buckeyes had compiled a 7\u20131 record before Evan Turner, who was averaging 20.6 points and 12.9 rebounds per game, was injured. Turner returned later in the season and help finish the season with a 24\u20137 record and a share of the Big Ten regular season championship. A victory over Minnesota in the Big Ten tournament gave Matta his second Big Ten tournament title and the Buckeyes a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. Ohio State advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to No. 6-seeded Tennessee 76\u201373. Turner was named the National Player of the Year and entered the NBA draft, where he was selected second overall.\nMatta's recruiting class heading into the 2010\u201311 season was highly regard and the Buckeyes returned some key seniors such as David Lighty and Jon Diebler. Ohio State was ranked No. 4 in the preseason polls and entered Big Ten conference play undefeated at 13\u20130, defeating No. 9 Florida and moving up to No. 2 in the nation. Ohio State continued to dominate the opposition during the regular season, pushing its record to 24\u20130 and 11\u20130 in conference play before losing the first game at No. 13 Wisconsin. Another loss at No. 11 Purdue marked their last loss in the regular season. Ohio State ended the season with a 29\u20132 record and 16\u20132 record in the Big Ten, winning the outright Big Ten regular season championship. OSU defeated Penn State for the Big Ten tournament championship, giving the Buckeyes their second tournament championship in a row and Matta's third tournament championship as head coach. Ohio State entered the NCAA tournament as the No. 1 overall seed for the second time under Matta. However, for the second year in a row, the Buckeyes failed to advance past the Sweet Sixteen, losing to Kentucky 62\u201360.\nThe Buckeyes, led by returning starters Jared Sullinger, Deshaun Thomas and Aaron Craft, entered the 2011\u201312 season ranked No. 3 in the nation. Ohio State entered Big Ten play with a 12\u20131 record, losing at No. 13 Kansas without Sullinger, who was injured. Ohio State finished the season winning a share of the Big Ten regular season championship and lost to Michigan State in the Big Ten tournament championship. Ohio State received a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the Final Four for the second time under Matta after a 77\u201370 victory over No. 1-seeded Syracuse. The Buckeye season would end with another loss to Kansas, 64\u201362. Following the season, Sullinger entered the NBA draft and was taken 21st overall.\nThe 2012\u201313 Buckeyes entered the season ranked No. 4 in the country. Led by Deshaun Thomas and Aaron Craft, they entered Big Ten play with only two losses, at No. 2 Duke and at home against No. 9 Kansas. They finished the season 13\u20135 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for second place, but would beat No. 8 Michigan State and No. 22 Wisconsin to win the Big Ten tournament. As a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, they advanced to the Elite Eight before losing to Wichita State. Following the season, Thomas declared for the NBA draft.\nWith the early departure of Thomas, the Buckeyes struggled in 2013\u201314, finishing the season 25\u201310, 10\u20138 in fifth place in Big Ten play. They advanced to the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament before losing to Michigan. As a No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament, they lost to Dayton in the second round (formerly known as the first round).\nThe 2015 Buckeyes were led by freshman D'Angelo Russell, but still finished in sixth place in Big Ten play with an 11\u20137 record. Despite losing to Michigan State in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament, OSU received a No. 10 seed in the NCAA tournament. They upset No. 7-seeded VCU in the second round, before losing to No. 5 Arizona in the third round. Following the season, Russell declared for the NBA draft and was selected second overall.\nWithout Russell, the 2016 Buckeyes finished 21\u201314, 11\u20137 in Big Ten play to finish in seventh place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament to Michigan State and failed to receive an invite to the NCAA tournament. They did receive a bid to the NIT, where they lost in the second round to Florida.\nIn 2016\u201317, OSU finished the season 17\u201315, 7\u201311 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for 10th place. As the No. 11 seed in the Big Ten tournament, the Buckeyes lost in the first round to Rutgers. They did not receive an invite to a postseason tournament.\nIn a surprise move more than two months after the season ended, the school announced that, after failing to make the NCAA Tournament in 2016 and 2017, Matta would not return as head coach for the 2017\u201318 season. Ohio State won 20 or more games in 12 of Matta's 13 seasons, received a berth in the NCAA Tournament eight times, made it to the Sweet Sixteen four times, and to the Final Four twice. Ohio State won the Big Ten regular-season championship five times and Big Ten tournament championship four times, appearing in the championship game six times under Matta.\nThad Matta's record at Ohio State\n\nChris Holtmann era (2017\u20132024)\nOn June 9, 2017, the school hired Butler head coach Chris Holtmann as head coach. The Buckeyes exceeded any and all expectations in Holtmann's first season in Columbus. Picked to finish no better than 11th in preseason media polls, the Buckeyes stormed out to a 9\u20130 record in Big Ten. Highlighting the 2017\u201318 season were home wins over Michigan, overcoming a first-half 20-point deficit, and No. 1 Michigan State along with a road victory at No. 3 Purdue, the Boilermakers\u2019 only home loss of the season. Holtmann was named the 2018 Big Ten Coach of the Year after leading the Buckeyes to a 25\u20139 overall record, a second-place finish in the Big Ten regular-season standings (15\u20133). The Buckeyes were led by Big Ten Player of the Year, Keita Bates-Diop, and a four-year starter, Jae\u2019Sean Tate; both of which are now in the NBA. The season ended on a somber note as the Buckeyes were eliminated in the second round of the 2018 NCAA tournament by Gonzaga.\nIn 2018\u201319, Holtmann's Buckeyes went 20\u201315, marking the sixth consecutive season a Holtmann team had won 20 or more games. As an 11-seed the Buckeyes knocked off 6-seed Iowa State to advance to the second round of the 2019 NCAA tournament, before being eliminated by Houston.\nThe 2019\u201320 season was cut short with the cancellation of the 2020 Big Ten and NCAA Tournaments. The Buckeyes posted an overall record of 21\u201310, which included four wins vs. Top 10 opponents (Villanova, at North Carolina, Kentucky and Maryland). Ohio State finished tied for fifth in the Big Ten at 11\u20139. Despite no postseason tournament, the Buckeyes managed 20 wins, marking the seventh consecutive season Holtmann-coach teams reached that plateau.\nIn a season shortened by COVID-19 implications, the 2020\u201321 Buckeyes went 21\u201310 record overall. Ohio State finished tied for fifth in the B1G (12\u20138) and reached the championship game of the 2021 Big Ten Tournament. The Buckeyes were led by 1st Team All-Big Ten forward EJ Liddell, and 3rd Team All-Big Ten guard Duane Washington Jr. Ohio State appeared in the AP Top 10 for the final seven weeks of the season and earned a #2 seed in the 2021 NCAA Tournament, only to lose to 15-seed Oral Roberts in the first round.\nThe 2021\u201322 Buckeyes posted a 20\u201312 record and 12\u20138 conference record. The team lost in the second round of the 2022 NCAA tournament to Villanova.\nHoltmann is the second Ohio State coach to win 20 or more games in his first five seasons in Columbus, joining Thad Matta (12 from 2005 to 2016). However, he has not won a conference championship, and his teams have struggled in postseason play: through his first 11 seasons as a head coach, his teams had never won a conference tournament, and had advanced beyond the first weekend of the NCAA tournament only once, leading to some criticism from fans.\nThe criticism of Holtmann continued in the 2022\u201323 season, as after starting the season with 10 wins in 13 games, the Buckeyes went into an extended tailspin, losing 14 of 15 games. On February 12, the Buckeyes scored just 41 points in a home blowout loss to Michigan State, the program's lowest point total in 27 years.\nHoltmann was fired on February 14, 2024, as the team continued to struggle in conference play as the team lost 9 out of his final 11 games. Assistant coach Jake Diebler was named interim head coach after his firing.\n\nFacilities\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes presently play their home games in the 19,200-seat Value City Arena. The first official home court for the Buckeyes was the Ohio Expo Center Coliseum. Constructed in 1918, the Buckeyes called this arena home between the years 1920 to 1955. The facility had a capacity of 7,000 people.\nIn 1955, a new facility was built on the campus of Ohio State named the St. John Arena named after Lynn St. John, an Ohio State basketball coach and athletic director.  This building, while hosting the men's basketball team, also hosted (and still to this day hosts) volleyball, gymnastics, and wrestling.  The capacity of St. John Arena is 13,276.  This building is the only Buckeye arena to serve as home for an Ohio State men's basketball championship team in 1960.\nWith the aging St. John Arena over 40 years old, Ohio State University decided to build Value City Arena to hold men's and women's basketball as well as hockey. The 770,000 sq foot arena was completed in 1998 and seats 19,500 for basketball games.\n\nOhio State University completed a $19 million renovation to the Schottenstein Center in 2013 that includes updated locker rooms for the Men's and Women's Basketball teams, a new training room with hydrotherapy pools, a new weight room, and a new practice gym to complement the existing gym.  A $34 million renovation completed in 2018 improved the concourse as well as added new space for the coaches, team shop, ticket office, and building administration.\nDuring the team's formative years the Buckeyes played their home games at the Ohio State University Armory. Built in 1897 at a cost of $115,000, the massive brick medieval style building was demolished in 1958 after damage caused by a fire. From 1897 to 1917 the Buckeyes used the building known as \"Drill Hall\" or \"The Gymnasium\" as their home court, only being asked to leave due to the outbreak of World War I. The team's overall record at the Armory was 178\u2013104.  In 1919, without a definite home, the team played some of their games at Indianola Park as well as the Coliseum and the Armory.  Finally, in 1920, the team officially moved to the Ohio State Fairgrounds and played in their home games at the Ohio Expo Center Coliseum.  During their time at the Coliseum, the Buckeyes played in five national title games.\n\nCoaches\nThe Buckeyes have had 14 coaches in their 110-year history. Thad Matta, who was hired in 2004, and led the Buckeyes to five NCAA Tournament appearances and two Final Four appearances during the 2006\u201307 and 2011\u201312 seasons. The only Ohio State coach to win a national championship was Fred Taylor in 1960.\n\nCurrent coaching staff\nAccomplishments\nNCAA National Championships\nFinal Four history\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nThe * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament.\n\nNCAA tournament results\nNIT results\nThe Buckeyes are two time NIT champions (1986, 2008).\n\nBig Ten tournament championships\nOhio State has won 4 Big Ten tournament championships since its inception during the 1997\u201398 season.

    "biography": "The Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team represents the University of Oklahoma in intercollegiate men's basketball. The program competes in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Sooners play their home games at the Lloyd Noble Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Oklahoma has won 14 conference championships, 7 conference tournaments. The team has participated in five Final Fours, and holds the record for most NCAA tournament wins without a championship.  As of the 2022 season, they are tied for 12th all-time in NCAA tournament appearances.  In addition to their tournament successes the program has produced 33 All-Americans including Wayman Tisdale, Stacey King, Harvey Grant, Mookie Blaylock, Ryan Minor, Hollis Price, Buddy Hield, and Blake Griffin, 9 first round draft picks, including one No. 1 pick (Blake Griffin) and four National Players of the Year: Vic Holt (1928), Gerald Tucker (1947), Blake Griffin (2009) and Buddy Hield (2016).\n\nHistory\n1908\u201380\nThe Sooners enjoyed moderate success on the court during this era, posting just 16 losing records in their first 72 seasons.  They were led by 9 different coaches during this period, beginning with Bennie Owen (who also coached the football team) and ending with Dave Bliss in 1980.  The Sooners participated in the very first Final Four in 1939.  OU made a second appearance in the championship game in 1947, losing 47\u201358 to Holy Cross.\n\n1981\u20131994 (the Billy Tubbs era)\nThe program gained national prominence under Billy Tubbs when he took over in 1981. Star players Wayman Tisdale, Mookie Blaylock, and Stacey King guided the Sooners to several deep runs in the NCAA tournament. In 1988, the Sooners reached the NCAA title game in Kansas City, where they fell four points shy of their first national title to the 11-loss Kansas Jayhawks, a team which they had beaten twice in regular season play.\nTubbs resigned on April 10, 1994, indicating that \"he did not feel appreciated enough working at a football school\" (he later reconciled with the administration and enjoyed a healthy relationship with the school up until his death from leukemia in 2020). Tubbs' base salary at Oklahoma in his final season was $107,000 annually. Tubbs, 59 years old at the time, left to take over the struggling Texas Christian University basketball program, signing a 5-year contract worth between $200,000 and $400,000 per season.\nTubbs' record at OU was 333\u2013132 (0.716) overall, 126\u201370 (0.643) conference, with 10 NCAA tournament appearances, one Final Four appearance, and one National Title Game appearance. Tubbs finished with 5 Big 8 regular season titles and 2 Conference tournament titles.\nTubbs averaged 24 wins per season (24\u20139) and 9 conference wins per season (9\u20135).\n\n1995\u20132006 (the Kelvin Sampson era)\nKelvin Sampson became the 11th head coach at the University of Oklahoma on April 25, 1994. Sampson was named national coach of the year in 1995 (his first year at OU) by the Associated Press, United States Basketball Writers Association and Basketball Weekly after guiding the Sooners to 23\u20139 overall and 15\u20130 home marks. It was the second-best overall record posted by a first-year coach in Big 8 history. Sampson possesses the highest winning percentage in Oklahoma history (.719). He guided OU to nine consecutive 20-win seasons. He averaged 24.4 wins over those nine campaigns. He directed the Sooners to postseason tournament berths in each of his 12 seasons (11 NCAA tournaments), with a Sweet 16 showing in 1999, a Final Four appearance in 2002 and an Elite Eight appearance in 2003. His teams also played in the Big 12 Tournament title game on five occasions during the 10 seasons he coached in the Big 12. In 2001, 2002, and 2003 the Sooners won that tournament. Sampson finished with a Big 12 Tournament record of 17\u20137.  Standouts Eduardo N\u00e1jera and Hollis Price helped the Sooners maintain a streak of 25 straight post season appearances, the longest in the nation. Sampson left OU in 2006 to take a head job at Indiana.\nSampson's record at OU was 279\u2013109 (0.719) overall, 128\u201360 (0.681) conference, with 11 NCAA tournament Appearances, including one Final Four appearance. In the Big 12, Sampson had 3 Conference tournament Titles and 1 Conference regular season Title.  During his final season at OU, Sampson's salary was approximately $900,000 annually, not including bonuses.  Sampson left OU in 2006 to become the head basketball coach at Indiana University, signing a 7-year, $10.5 million contract, at $1.5 million per season.\nUnder Sampson's watch, Oklahoma was placed under a three-year investigation by the NCAA for recruiting violations. At the end of their investigation, the NCAA issued a report citing more than 550 illegal calls made by Sampson and his staff to 17 different recruits. The NCAA barred Sampson from recruiting off campus and making phone calls for one year, ending May 24, 2007.\nSampson averaged 23 wins per season (23\u20139) and 11 conference wins per season (11\u20135).\n\n2006\u20132011 (the Jeff Capel era)\nOn April 11, 2006, Jeff Capel was named the 12th head basketball coach at Oklahoma, succeeding Kelvin Sampson. Though the Sooner Nation as a whole greeted Capel's hiring with optimism, one notable downside of the coaching change emerged\u2014Sampson's departure caused three of the players who had signed with OU (once considered a top-five recruiting class) to rethink each's decision to attend OU. Scottie Reynolds went on to Villanova, and Damion James to Texas.  Capel was originally signed to a four-year, $3 million contract, at $750,000 annually.\nIn his first year, after going 8\u20134 in non-conference games, with losses to Memphis, Purdue, Villanova, and Alabama, the Sooners started 6\u20133 in conference play, before losing their final 7 conference games.  After winning only one game in the Big 12 Conference tournament, losing to eventual conference tournament champion Kansas, the Sooners missed any form of postseason play, which snapped the nation's longest streak of 25 consecutive years in the postseason, starting with Billy Tubbs' second year in 1982 and ending with Kelvin Sampson's final year in 2006.\nIn his second year, after signing McDonald's All-American Forward Blake Griffin, the Sooners finished 21\u201310 during the regular season (9-7 in Big 12 play) earning them a No. 4 seed in the Big 12 Tournament, where they won one game before losing to Texas in the semi-finals.  They received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they defeated St. Joseph's in the first round before losing to No. 3 seed Louisville in the second round, finishing the season at 23\u201312, an improvement of 7 wins over the previous season.  After this successful second season, Capel's name began to surface among many head coaching vacancies. In an effort to keep Capel, OU Athletic Director Joe Castiglione and the OU Board of Regents extended Capel's contract through 2014, and increased his salary to $1.05 million per year.\nPlayer of the Year Candidate Blake Griffin announced he would be returning for his sophomore season, forgoing a possible lottery-pick status in the NBA draft. Coupled with the signing of another McDonald's All-American guard in Willie Warren, the 2008\u20132009 season looked to be promising.\nThe team experienced one of the best starts in school history at 25\u20131, until Griffin was sidelined with a concussion during the first half of the OU\u2013Texas game on February 21, 2009. The Sooners went on to lose consecutive games for the first time all season, to Texas by 5 in Austin and Kansas by 9 in Norman. Without their star player, the Sooners fell short. Griffin returned to the lineup on February 28, 2009, and the Sooners returned to their winning ways defeating Texas Tech by 15 in Lubbock on 2/28/09, before losing on the road to Missouri, who was undefeated at home, and finishing the regular season by sweeping in-state rival Oklahoma State, who had won 7 of their previous 8 games.  After a first-round bye in the Big 12 Tournament, the 2nd-seeded Sooners lost to the 7th-seeded Cowboys by 1 point during the final seconds of the game.\nCapel's Sooners were granted a No. 2 seed for the NCAA tournament, and easily beat No. 15 seed Morgan State in the first round, #10 seed Michigan in the second round, and #3 seed Syracuse in the Sweet 16, whose vaunted 2\u20133 zone defense did nothing to slow down the Sooners' hot shooting from the perimeter.\nHowever, after hitting nine three-pointers during the previous game with Syracuse, the Sooner guards went 0/15 from beyond the arc during the first 35 minutes of their Elite 8 game against North Carolina, before finishing 2\u201319 in the game. This ultimately led to their demise by the Tar Heels on March 29, losing 60\u201372. Unanimous All-American Forward and Player of the Year Blake Griffin finished the tournament with 114 points and 60 rebounds, becoming the first player to accomplish such a feat in over 40 years. Griffin, who gave up his final two years of eligibility to enter the NBA draft, and was the #1 pick.  The Sooners finished Capel's third season at 34\u20132, the school's first 30+ win season since 2002, and 2th overall.  This was again an improvement of 7 wins over the previous season.\nEven with the loss of starters Austin Johnson, Taylor Griffin, and Blake Griffin, the Sooners had two incoming McDonald's All-American recruits in point guard Tommy Mason-Griffin and center Keith \"Tiny\" Gallon. Paired with returning McDonald's All-American guard Willie Warren, guard Tony Crocker, and former reserve forward Ryan Wright, the Sooners had a chance to post yet another successful season and were poised make another deep run into the NCAA tournament.  This was the first time in the school's history where they had three McDonald's All-Americans on the roster at the same time.\nDespite high hopes and a preseason ranking of No. 16, Jeff Capel and his Sooners proved to be one of the most overrated teams in the 2009\u20132010 season.  After a mediocre 13\u20139 start, their season slipped away as they lost their last nine games of the season, including a first-round loss to Oklahoma State in the Big 12 tournament, leaving them with a 13\u201318 record to cap off the season. Those wins were vacated in November 2011 after various violations that included improper benefits and ineligible players.\nCapel's record at OU was 83\u201369 (0.546) overall, 33\u201343 (0.463) in conference (with 13 total wins and 4 conference wins having been vacated), with 2 NCAA tournament Appearances, and one Elite Eight appearance. In the Big 12, Capel did not win a Conference tournament title or regular season title.\nCapel finished 2010\u201311 with a 14\u201318 record and a loss to the Texas Longhorns in the 2011 Big 12 Tournament. On March 14, 2011, he was fired as head coach of the Sooners.\nIn November 2011, the NCAA punished Oklahoma with three years probation, a $15,000 fine, reductions in recruiting, the loss of a scholarship, and vacation of all wins for the 2009\u201310 season.\n\n2011\u20132021 (the Lon Kruger era)\nLon Kruger was hired by OU to replace Jeff Capel as head coach prior to the 2011\u201312 season. Kruger had previously coached at Kansas State, Florida, Illinois and UNLV. In his first season at helm, the Sooners finished 15\u201316, improving on their 2010\u201311 finish.\nThe 2012\u201313 season yielded a surprising 20\u201312 (11\u20137 Big 12, 4th) finish and resulted in the program's first NCAA tournament bid since Blake Griffin led the school to the Elite 8 in 2009. However, the Sooners were defeated in the second round of the NCAA tournament by San Diego State.\nThe 2013\u201314 season continued this trend of improvement, as the Sooners finished 23\u201310 overall (12\u20136 Big 12, 2nd). However, they were again upset in the second round of the NCAA tournament, falling to North Dakota State.\n4 of the 5 starters from the 2013\u201314 team returned for the 2014\u201315 season. Guard Buddy Hield was Big 12 player of the year as OU made it to the Big 12 tournament semifinals before Iowa State bounced them out. Oklahoma received a #3 seed in the East region of the NCAA tournament, made it to the Sweet Sixteen by beating little regarded Albany and Dayton, but couldn't advance to the regional final (Elite Eight) as Michigan State held on 62\u201358.\nIn the 2015\u20132016 season, Oklahoma finished 24\u20136 in the regular season, and despite losing to West Virginia in the Big 12 Tournament's second round, received a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament. Oklahoma easily beat Cal State Bakersfield in the first round, but struggled to finish off VCU in the second round despite an early 21\u20137 lead. Oklahoma then went on to defeat Texas A&M 77\u201363 to advance to the west regional final where the Sooners defeated top-seed Oregon 80\u201368 to advance to the Final Four.  Their Final Four opponent was Villanova, also a number two seed who upset Big 12 rival and number one seed Kansas to reach the Final Four.  Oklahoma lost to Villanova 95\u201351 in the national semifinal game.\nLon Kruger is the first coach in history to take 5 different schools to the Sweet Sixteen.  He is also the only coach to win a game in the NCAA tournament with 5 different schools. \nKruger retired from coaching on March 25, 2021.\n\n2021\u2013present (the Porter Moser era)\nOn April 3, 2021, the Sooners announced the hiring of Porter Moser, the coach who brought Loyola Chicago to the Final Four in 2018 and had recently coached the Ramblers to a Sweet 16.\n\nConference affiliations\nOklahoma has been affiliated with the following conferences:\n\nCoaching staff\nAs of March 19, 2023:\n\nChampionships\nConference regular season\n\u00a7 \u2013 Conference co-champions\n\nConference tournament championships\nRecords\nCareer Points\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Sooners have appeared in the NCAA tournament 34 times.

    "biography": "The Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team represents Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma, United States in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. All women's teams at the school are known as Cowgirls. The Cowboys currently compete in the Big 12 Conference. \nOklahoma State men\u2019s basketball has a very rich history of success, having won back-to-back national championships in 1945 and 1946. The Cowboys also boast six Final Fours to go along with 11 Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen appearances over a total of 29 NCAA tournaments. Oklahoma State has also won a combined total of 23 conference titles, with their most recent title coming in the 2005 Big 12 tournament. In 2020, CBS Sports ranked Oklahoma State the 25th best college basketball program of all-time, ahead of programs such as Oklahoma and Texas. \nSince 1938, the team has played its home games in Gallagher-Iba Arena. The Cowboys are currently led by Steve Lutz, in his 2nd season after he was hired as head coach on April 1, 2024.\n\nHistory\nOklahoma State University (then Oklahoma A&M College) began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1908. The Cowboys (including the predecessor Aggies teams) rank 40th in total victories among all NCAA Division I college basketball programs, with an all-time win\u2013loss record of 1,748\u20131,249 (.583) at the end of 2023\u201324 season.\nThe Cowboys (including the predecessor Aggies teams) have made 29 total appearances in the NCAA tournament (39\u201328 overall record), reaching the NCAA Final Four six times (1945, 1946, 1949, 1951, 1995, 2004) and the NCAA regional finals (Elite Eight) eleven times. Oklahoma State (then Oklahoma A&M College) won the NCAA Championship in 1945 and 1946. The Cowboys rank eleventh (tied with six other programs) in all-time Final Four appearances and tenth (tied with five others) in total NCAA Championships.\n\nThe early years (1907\u201334)\nUnder nine head coaches in this period, Oklahoma A&M found very little success, with only six winning seasons. Very little success was found early on and after a 6\u201315 season under first-year head coach John Maulbetsch, things were not looking well. However, in the next three seasons Maulbetsch turned around the program, leading the Aggies to a 41\u201320 record culminating with a first-place finish in their last season in the Southwest Conference. The move to the Missouri Valley Conference in 1925 would halt the progress under this budding coach however, and after Maulbetsch resigned from the positions of football, baseball and basketball coach, the Aggies would not have another winning season until Henry Iba took the reins in 1934. However, despite an overall record of 7\u20139, the Aggies did win the Missouri Valley Conference Co-Championship in 1930\u201331 under Coach George E. Rody with a conference record of 5\u20133.\nThis period in Oklahoma State basketball history was marked with mainly football coaches heading the football, baseball and basketball teams.\n\nHenry Iba era (1934\u201370)\nHenry Iba came to Oklahoma A&M College in 1934, where he remained for 36 years, retiring after the 1969\u201370 season. For most of his tenure at A&M/OSU, he doubled as athletic director.\nIba's teams were methodical, ball-controlling units that featured weaving patterns and low scoring games.  Iba's \"swinging gate\" defense (a man-to-man with team flow) was applauded by many, and is still effective in today's game. He was known as \"the Iron Duke of Defense\".\nIba's Aggies became the first to win consecutive NCAA national championship titles (in 1945 and 1946). They beat NYU in the 1945 national championship and North Carolina in the 1946 national championship. He was voted coach of the year in both seasons. His two national title teams were led by Bob Kurland, the game's first seven-foot player. Additionally, Iba's 1945 team defeated National Invitation Tournament champion, DePaul, and 6' 9\" center George Mikan in a classic Red Cross Benefit game. Iba's 1949 and 1951 teams also reached the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament.\nIn conference play, Oklahoma A&M/Oklahoma State teams won 655 games, 14 Missouri Valley championships, and one Big Eight championship in 36 seasons with Iba as head men's basketball coach.\n\"Mr. Iba,\" as he is still popularly known at OSU, remained a fixture on campus until his death in 1993, often giving advice to players during practice.  One seat in the southeast concourse level of Gallagher-Iba Arena (which was renamed in his honor in 1987) remains unused in his honor.\n\n1970\u201390\nThe mostly subpar results of Iba's final decade in Stillwater largely remained the status quo for Oklahoma State during the two decades following his retirement. From the 1970\u201371 to 1989\u201390 seasons, the Cowboys finished with winning records only six times, finished in the top half of the Big Eight Conference standings only three times, and earned a berth in the NCAA tournament only once.\n\nEddie Sutton era (1990\u20132006)\nAfter being an assistant for the Cowboys in 1958\u201359, Eddie Sutton returned to Oklahoma State in 1990 to coach. In the years leading up to his hiring, the team had made postseason play only three times since joining the Big Eight Conference in 1957.\nThe Cowboys began to turn around almost immediately with Sutton's presence, and in 1991, Oklahoma State returned to the NCAA Tournament, winning their first NCAA Tournament game since making the Elite Eight in 1965. Sutton\u2019s Cowboys advanced all the way to the Sweet Sixteen during his first two seasons. In 1995, the Pokes, under the leadership of Bryant \"Big Country\" Reeves and Randy Rutherford, captured the Big Eight Conference Tournament and clinched a bid to the 1995 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. They advanced to the Final Four in Seattle, Washington, where they lost to eventual national champion UCLA. It was the Cowboys' deepest advance in the tournament since 1951.\nLed by John Lucas III, Joey Graham, and 2004 Big 12 Player of the Year Tony Allen, Sutton's 2003\u201304 team finished with a school-record 31 wins (31\u20134), won both the Big 12 regular season and tournament championships, and advanced to the Final Four as a No. 2 seed in the 2004 NCAA tournament. The Cowboys finished the season ranked No. 4 in the final AP Poll and Coaches' Poll.\nIn his 16 seasons in Stillwater, the Cowboys reached the postseason 15 times (having declined an NIT bid in Sutton's sixth season as head coach), including 13 NCAA Tournament bids and two Final Four appearances. They also captured three regular-season conference titles and three conference tournament championships. Sutton finished his career at OSU as the second-winningest coach in school history, behind only his mentor, Iba.\n\n2001 plane crash\nOn January 27, 2001, one of three planes carrying Oklahoma State staff and players crashed in a snow storm near Byers, Colorado, killing all 10 on board.  The plane was on its way back from a loss against the University of Colorado.  Those killed included Nate Fleming, a redshirt freshman guard; Dan Lawson, a junior guard; Bill Teegins, radio sportscaster of OSU basketball and sports anchor on CBS affiliate KWTV-9 in Oklahoma City; Kendall Durfey, television and radio engineer; Will Hancock, media relations coordinator; Pat Noyes, director of basketball operations; Brian Luinstra, athletic trainer; Jared Weiberg, student assistant; Denver Mills, pilot; and Bjorn Falistrom, co-pilot.\nSince 2007, Oklahoma State has honored these ten during an annual 5k and 10K race called the Remember the Ten Run.\n\nSean Sutton era (2006\u201308)\nEddie Sutton's son, Sean Sutton, also a former Cowboy player, took over head coaching duties in 2006. Following a record of 39\u201329 which included a 13\u201319 mark in Big 12 play during his first two seasons, Sutton resigned under pressure after a March 31, 2008, meeting with Athletic Director Mike Holder.\n\nTravis Ford era (2008\u201316)\nOn April 16, 2008, Travis Ford was hired as the 18th men's basketball head coach at Oklahoma State. He resigned from the same position with the UMass Minutemen to take the position. At the time of his hiring, he had a Division I coaching record of 123\u2013115. Ford also coached at Eastern Kentucky and Campbellsville University (NAIA). As a player, he was coached by Norm Stewart at the University of Missouri as a freshman. He transferred after his freshman season and played for three years (1992\u201394) at the University of Kentucky under Rick Pitino.\nFord was fired on March 18, 2016 after a season in which the Cowboys went 3\u201315 in Big 12 play and 12\u201320 overall. Although he led the Cowboys to five NCAA tournaments in his eight seasons in charge, he never finished higher than third in conference play, and finished sixth or worse in the Big 12 seven times.\n\nBrad Underwood era (2016\u20132017)\nThree days after Ford's firing, Oklahoma State hired Brad Underwood from Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA). He began his coaching career at Kansas State, first serving as director of basketball operations for a season and then serving as an assistant for five more. Underwood then went to South Carolina as an assistant for a season before being hired to his first head coaching post at SFA. During his three seasons in charge, the Lumberjacks went 89\u201314 overall and 53\u20131 in Southland Conference regular-season play, making the NCAA tournament all three seasons and advancing to the second round twice. Underwood's 89 wins tie him with Brad Stevens for the most wins by a men's basketball head coach in his first three seasons at an NCAA school. He is also the first coach to be named Southland Conference Coach of the Year three consecutive times. On March 18, 2017 Brad Underwood was hired at Illinois. During the 2016-17 season, Associate head coach Lamont Evans was engaged in bribery scheme that came to light in 2017. Evans was sentenced to three months in prison in June 2019 for his participation in the scheme, which he also conducted at the University of South Carolina. In June 2020 press release, the NCAA announced a postseason ban for 2020\u201321.\n\nMike Boynton era (2017\u20132024)\nThe school promoted assistant coach Mike Boynton Jr. to head coach on March 24, 2017. He was fired on March 14, 2024, after a 13th place conference finish and first round exit from the Big 12 Tournament. Boynton finished with a 119\u2013109 (.522) record, including 51\u201375 (.405) in conference play.\n\nSteve Lutz era (2024\u2013present)\nSteve Lutz was announced as the head coach on April 1, 2024. In his first year, the Cowboys went 7\u201313 in the Big 12 and 17\u201318 overall, earning a bid to the NIT, where they fell in the quarterfinals to North Texas.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Cowboys have appeared in the NCAA tournament 29 times. Their combined record is 39\u201328. They won consecutive national championships in 1945 and 1946.\n\nNIT results\nThe Cowboys have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 14 times. Their combined record is 13\u201315.\n\nFacilities\nGallagher-Iba Arena\nGallagher-Iba Arena, once dubbed \u201cMadison Square Garden of the Plains\u201d, is the basketball and wrestling venue at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Originally completed in 1938 and named the 4-H Club and Student Activities Building, it was soon renamed Gallagher Hall to honor wrestling coach, Ed Gallagher. After renovations in 1987, the name became Gallagher-Iba Arena, as a tribute to longtime basketball coach and innovator, Henry Iba. Gallagher-Iba Arena was named the best college gymnasium by CBS SportsLine.com in August 2001.\nThe first basketball game was played on December 9, 1938, when Iba's Oklahoma A&M Aggies beat Phog Allen\u2019s Kansas Jayhawks, 21\u201315, in a battle between two of the nation's early basketball powers. In its original configuration, seating was limited to 6,381. Though small by today's standards, it was the largest collegiate facility in the country when completed. The original maple floor, still in use today, was the most expensive of its kind in America when it was installed in 1938.\nOklahoma State completed a $55 million expansion of Gallagher-Iba Arena prior to the 1999\u20132000 Cowboy basketball season. Rather than build a new, off-campus arena to accommodate the need for additional seating, the decision was made to expand Gallagher-Iba Arena itself to more than double its original capacity (from its 6,381-seat capacity to its current 13,611 seats). The old sightlines and the original white maple floor were kept (it remains the oldest original basketball court floor still in use).\nOn January 15, 2005, the court was officially named after Eddie Sutton as Eddie Sutton Court.\n\nNotable players\nCowboys in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\nFive members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame have been associated with the Oklahoma State's men's basketball team.

These were also the first 20-win seasons in school history; the Rebels had been one of the few longstanding members of a \"power conference\" to have never tallied a 20-win season.\nEvans left for Arizona State in 1998. His top assistant, Rod Barnes, took over at Ole Miss and compiled a record of 141\u2013109 during his eight-year tenure. During his tenure, the Rebels reached the 1999, 2001, and 2002 NCAA Tournaments. The 1998\u201399 team notched the school's first-ever NCAA Tournament win, while the 2001 team advanced all the way to the Sweet 16. His tenure crested at that point, however, and he would not have another winning season after 2002.\nFollowing the 2005\u201306 season, Ole Miss hired Andy Kennedy, and the Rebels tied for first place in the SEC West during the 2006\u201307 season. Led by the senior trio of Clarence Sanders, Bam Doyne, and Todd Abernethy, the Ole Miss men finished the year with a 21\u201313 record, including a 16\u20131 record at home inside Tad Smith Coliseum. They advanced to the second round of the NIT, before falling at Clemson. In his debut season with the Rebels, Kennedy was named the 2007 SEC Coach of the Year by the Associated Press after guiding Ole Miss, a preseason last-place pick in the SEC West, to its first division title and most wins since 2001.\nIn the 2012\u201313 season, Ole Miss won just their second SEC tournament title and made the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2002. Ole Miss also set a school record for most SEC wins in a season. Kennedy was again named SEC Coach of the Year. On February 23, 2013, Kennedy became the all-time winningest coach at Ole Miss.\n\nActive NBA players\nTerence Davis \u2013 Sacramento Kings\n\nActive international players\nRomello White (born 1998) - basketball player for Hapoel Eilat of the Israeli Basketball Premier League\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Rebels have appeared in the NCAA tournament ten times.

    "biography": "The Oral Roberts Golden Eagles men's basketball team is the basketball team representing Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The team is a member of Summit League.\nOral Roberts has made appearances in seven NCAA Tournaments, the most recent appearance in 2023. The team has also appeared in eight National Invitation Tournaments, one College Basketball Invitational, and two CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournaments. The Golden Eagles have won seven regular season conference championships and six tournament championships. The team has been members of the Southland Conference and the Midwestern Collegiate Conference.\nIn the opening round of the 2021 tournament, the Golden Eagles recorded just the ninth 15 vs. 2 upset in tournament history, defeating Ohio State 75\u201372 in overtime, in the process winning their first tournament game since 1974. Two days later, they became just the second 15 seed (after the 2013 Florida Gulf Coast Eagles) to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, after defeating #7 Florida 81\u201378.\nOn April 10, 2017, the school fired all-time winningest coach Scott Sutton after 18 years. He finished with an overall record of 328\u2013247. The school named Paul Mills as the new head coach on April 28.\nPrior to the 1993\u201394 season, ORU was known as the Titans. The Golden Eagles and Tulsa Golden Hurricane exchange a traveling trophy, the Mayor's Cup, in the two teams' crosstown rivalry.\n\nPostseason play\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Golden Eagles have appeared in seven NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 4\u20137.\n\n1974 NCAA Tournament\nORU, in just its eighth season of varsity competition, made the big show and almost stole the show, coming within three points of advancing to the Final Four. The Titans finished the regular season 21\u20135 before receiving the NCAA bid and then proceeded to knock off Syracuse 86\u201382 in overtime in the sub-Regional in Denton, Texas in the first round and Louisville 96\u201393 at the Mabee Center to move on to the Elite Eight. ORU's dream season came to an end on its home floor, however, as Kansas overcame a nine-point deficit in the game's final minutes to send it to overtime, where the Jayhawks won 93\u201390. ORU, at 23\u20136, won 20-plus games for the fifth straight season, closing out Ken Trickey's five-year coaching stay with an incredible 118\u201323 record. ORU averaged 94.6 points, the fifth straight season over the 90-point mark under Trickey, whose running style helped revolutionize offensive basketball from then on. Junior guard Sam McCants paced the Titans with a 24.0 scoring average, while senior forward Eddie Woods completed a standout four-year career by leading the team with a 12.1 rebounding average. The Titans finished 18th in the final Associated Press ranking, the second time in three years placing in the Top Twenty.\n\n1984 NCAA Tournament\nVisions of the final-eight Titans of ten years earlier danced in the heads of the 1983\u201384 Titans as ORU advanced to the NCAA Tournament after winning the Midwestern Collegiate Conference postseason party with a 68\u201366 decision over Xavier. The Titans had won the regular season conference title with an 11\u20133 record and then took all three games in the MCC tourney to gain the right to play Memphis State in Memphis, Tenn., in first-round NCAA play. ORU, behind junior center Mark Acres' 28 points, gave Memphis State all it could handle but eventually bowed in defeat 92\u201383 to the homestanding Tigers. Acres, the MCC Player of the Year, was on his way to his third straight All-American season in which he would finish with team leading averages of 20.8 points and 10.5 rebounds. He was not alone during ORU's march to the NCAA Tournament, receiving support from junior teammates Sam Potter (18.1 ppg) and Jeff Acres (15.0), his older brother who bounced back from a redshirt season to play a key role in the Titans' resurgence. ORU, which opened the season with a 4\u20135 start, turned things around the rest of the way, posting a 17\u20134 record on its way to the MCC crown.\n\n2006 NCAA Tournament\nOne year after coming so close to reaching their first NCAA Tournament in over 20 years, the Golden Eagles finally advanced to the Big Dance. Plagued by injuries to key players throughout the season, the Golden Eagles rallied down the regular-season's home stretch, tying IUPUI for the Mid-Continent Conference regular season title on the final day. ORU again earned the No. 1 seed for the Mid-Con Tournament and this time, there was no miracle, last-second shot in the title game. ORU romped by Chicago State, 85\u201372, in the title game in Tulsa, earning the school's first NCAA Tournament berth in 22 years. Junior guard Ken Tutt, who earlier missed 10 conference games with a broken foot, earned Tournament MVP honors. Despite being a 16 seed for the NCAA Tournament, the Golden Eagles were much-ballyhooed in the days leading up to their meeting with No. 1 seed Memphis, with some so-called \"experts\" labeling the Golden Eagles as the best No. 16 seed ever. ORU gave the Tigers a good tussle, but eventually came up short in Dallas. Junior forward Caleb Green once again enjoyed a tremendous season, claiming his second straight Mid-Con Player of the Year honor, and once again earning honorable mention All-America honors from the AP. The Golden Eagles enjoyed significant nationwide exposure, playing on national television three different times, including a 68\u201348 win over Southern Cal on ESPN2 while at the Great Alaska Shootout. The Golden Eagles kept the Mayor's Cup at the Mabee Center for the third straight season with a 62\u201348 defeat of Tulsa.\n\n2007 NCAA Tournament\nWith seniors Green and Tutt leading the way, the Golden Eagles made history by becoming the first ORU team to reach consecutive NCAA Tournaments. Green, who became the Mid-Continent Conference's all-time leader in points and rebounds, earned conference player of the year for the third time and captured Mid-Con Tournament MVP honors. But it was Tutt's clutch shooting which carried the Golden Eagles to the tournament title. Tutt banked in a running jumper with 31 seconds remaining to give ORU a come-from behind victory over Oakland and a second straight NCAA Tournament berth. The basket not only gave ORU a title, but also put Tutt at 2,000 career points, making him and Green just the seventh duo in NCAA history to reach 2,000 together. But it was not just post-season success which the Golden Eagles enjoyed. On November 15, ORU enjoyed the biggest regular-season victory in school history with a shocking 78\u201371 win at No. 3 Kansas. Marchello Vealy, who later won Mid-Con Sixth Man of the Year honors, scored a career-high 22 points off the bench, hitting seven consecutive three-pointers during the game.\n\n2008 NCAA Tournament\nWith the loss of 2,000-point scorers Caleb Green and Ken Tutt, it seemed unlikely for the Golden Eagles to repeat as Summit League champions for the fourth consecutive year. However, a foursome of unheralded seniors and a high-scoring newcomer helped propel ORU to the unlikeliest of championship seasons. Seniors Moses Ehambe, Shawn King, Adam Liberty and Yemi Ogunoye guided ORU to a 24\u20139 overall record and a 16\u20132 conference record, which included a record 13\u20130 start. The best defense in school history propelled the Golden Eagles to regular season wins over Tulsa and Oklahoma State. Head coach Scott Sutton was named Summit League Coach of the Year. Junior guard Robert Jarvis sparked ORU's offense off the bench, leading the nation's reserves in scoring at 16.1 points per game on his way to Summit League Sixth Man of the Year. Ogunoye, a defensive stalwart for five seasons, earned Summit League Defensive Player of the Year, and Ehambe, on the strength of a record eight three-pointers in the opening round and 25 points in the championship game, earned Summit League tournament MVP honors.\n\n2021 NCAA Tournament\nSeeded fourth in the Summit League tournament, the Golden Eagles topped North Dakota before nabbing upset wins over top-seeded South Dakota State and North Dakota State in the respective semifinal and championship rounds. A crucial block and steal by Francis L\u0101cis with two seconds remaining in the latter game allowed the Golden Eagles to escape with a 75\u201372 victory and reach their first NCAA men's basketball tournament in 13 years. Placed in a No. 15 seed in the South region, ORU went on to pull off a shocking upset of the No. 2 seed and Big Ten runner-up Ohio State Buckeyes in a 75\u201372 overtime triumph. Kevin Obanor and Max Abmas combined for 59 points in the victory. The Golden Eagles beat the Florida Gators 81\u201378 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, becoming just the second No. 15 seed to advance to the regional semifinal round (and first since Florida Gulf Coast in 2013). But against the Arkansas Razorbacks, they fell by a 72\u201370 final which caused their run to end.\n\nNAIA results\nOral Roberts competed in one NAIA tournament. They finished with a record of 2\u20131.\n\nNIT results\nThe Golden Eagles have appeared in eight National Invitation Tournaments (NIT). Their combined record is 2\u20138.\n\n1972 NIT\nORU's first postseason team ever, the 1971\u201372 edition of the 'run-and-gun' Titans featured: guard Richard Fuqua, who would finish second in the nation among small-college players in scoring with a 35.9 average; forward Eddie Woods, who averaged 14.5 rebounds per game, still an ORU single-season high; forward Sam McCamey, ORU's first draftee when he was selected in the eighth round of the 1972 draft by Boston; and guard Eldon Lawyer, Fuqua's running mate. The team won four straight games to open the season before losing at Murray State 94\u201387 on Dec. 18. ORU then reeled off a school record 22 wins in a row, the last being a 94\u201374 drubbing of Memphis State at Madison Square Garden in the opening round of the NIT. ORU's season and win streak came to an end three nights later when the Titans lost to St. John's 94\u201378. The 1971\u201372 team, which topped the century mark in scoring 20 times in 28 games, led the nation offensively with a 105.1 points per game average and in rebounding at 60.2 boards per game. ORU finished 16th in the final Associated Press ranking.\n\n1973 NIT\nMaking a second consecutive appearance in the NIT, the 1972\u201373 ORU Titans posted a final record of 21\u20136, marking the fourth straight 20\u2013win season for the university. Headlining the 1972\u201373 edition was senior guard Richard Fuqua, who led the team for the fourth straight year in scoring with a 23.5 average. Sophomore center David Vaughn steered the team with Fuqua. He posted averages of 19.2 points and 14.3 rebounds to earn All-American honors along with Fuqua. Both players were drafted following the season, with Fuqua going to Boston and Vaughn to Virginia in the ABA. For the second consecutive year, ORU led the nation in scoring, averaging 97.3 points per outing, while scoring 100 or more points in a contest 11 times. The Titans also ranked first nationally in field-goal attempts per game (98.5) and in rebound margin (+15.3). The 1972\u201373 team average of 65.9 rebounds per game still stands as a school record. The 1972\u201373 season did mark the end of ORU's school-record 52-game home winning streak when Marshall defeated the Titans 106\u2013103 on Feb. 10 in the Homecoming game. The streak had dated back to Feb. 17, 1969, when the Titans played in the old Dome on campus. ORU's appearance in the NIT came to an abrupt 82\u201365 end at the hands of North Carolina at the Garden.\n\n1975 NIT\nThe Titans did not skip a beat under new head coach Jerry Hale, posting a 20\u20138 record and advancing to postseason play for the fourth straight year. The team's appearance in the NIT at Madison Square Garden marked the third time in four seasons in the postseason classic for the Titans, who nipped Memphis State 97\u201395 in the first round before losing a hard-fought battle to Oregon 68\u201359 four nights later. Sophomore forward Anthony Roberts blossomed into an offensive force and gave an extended glimpse of things to come by averaging 22.4 points per game to lead the team. Roberts had averaged just 5.2 points per outing in limited action the year before. He was followed closely by fellow sophomore Arnold Dugger, who averaged 17.1 points in his first season with the Titans after coming to ORU with Hale from the junior college level. Roberts and Dugger would each earn All-American honors at the end of the season, with Roberts being named to the Independent First Team squad. The team's 20\u20138 record marked the sixth consecutive 20-plus win campaign and included wins over Texas A&M, Jacksonville and Southern Illinois.\n\n1977 NIT\nORU returned to the NIT for the fourth time in six years on the strength of a 21\u20136 regular season record. Unfortunately, the team's appearance in the NIT was short-lived as Oregon spoiled a record-setting performance by senior forward Anthony 'Woosie' Roberts in a thrilling 90\u201389 win over the Titans at the Mabee Center. Roberts, who completed the season as the nation's second-leading scorer with a 34.0 average, blistered the Ducks for 65 points in the NIT loss, setting a single-game tournament high that still stands today. Woosie, who also averaged 9.2 rebounds while shooting 54.4 percent, earned consensus All-American honors for his senior-season heroics. Joining Roberts to form ORU's Titan-ic trio were senior guard Arnold Dugger and senior forward Alvin Scott. Dugger concluded the season with 501 career assists and still holds the record while accomplishing the feat in just three seasons. Scott swatted away a team-leading 81 shots and led the team in rebounding with a 9.5 average. His season block total is an ORU record. Roberts, Dugger and Scott were all drafted in 1977, with Roberts going in the first round to Denver. Scott, picked by Phoenix in the seventh round, enjoyed a long career with the Suns.\n\n1982 NIT\nFive years to the day of the 1977 Titans' 90\u201389 loss to Oregon, ORU was back in the NIT, hosting state rival Oklahoma at the Mabee\nCenter. The Sooners put a damper on the anniversary festivities with an 81\u201373 victory, spoiling the Titans' fifth appearance overall in the NIT. ORU, coming off an 11\u201316 season in 1980\u201381, relied on the contributions of both young and old throughout the campaign. Freshman center Mark Acres became just the third first-year player to lead the team in scoring, joining Dana Lewis in 1967\u201368 and Richard Fuqua in 1969\u201370, by averaging 14.6 points per game. Acres also paced the Titans in rebounding with an 8.1 average. Senior guard Gary 'Cat' Johnson finished second behind Acres with a 14.2 scoring mark and sophomore forward Lester Gill placed third with 12.2 ppg. Acres earned AP honorable mention All-American accolades for his efforts. The Titans, in their third season under head coach Ken Hayes, opened the season 7\u20133 and used that momentum to overcome injuries and a tough conference slate to qualify for the NIT berth.\n\n1997 NIT\nOral Roberts advanced to Division I postseason play for the first time since 1983\u201384 and the first time as the Golden Eagles. With the leadership of four seniors and the impressive play of junior sensation shooting guard Tim Gill, Head Coach Bill Self led his team to a postseason berth for the first time under his direction in the fourth and last season of his tenure as head coach. ORU's final regular season record was 21\u20136, and this was the Golden Eagles' final year as an independent. Victories over such teams as No. 16 Arkansas, nationally ranked Tulsa and established Oklahoma State were not enough to give ORU an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, but the National Invitation Tournament did extend a bid. The Eagles gladly accepted and headed up to South Bend, Indiana, to face Notre Dame and Big East player of the year Pat Garrity on March 12, 1997. ORU went into the game with wins in 12 of its last 13 games, but whatever the reason, the Golden Eagles did not show up to play against the Fighting Irish. Notre Dame only led by six at the half (35\u201329), but extended its lead to as many as 18 points in the second period (74\u201356 at 0:15) and ended up winning by 16, 74\u201358. Gill still led all scorers in the contest with 21 points.\n\n2005 NIT\nA much-anticipated season culminated with a post-season tournament berth, though it was not the tournament the Golden Eagles\nhad hoped for. Following a 23-win regular season, a Mid-Continent Conference regular season title and a pair of wins in the Mid-Con Tournament, the Golden Eagles were stunned in the Mid-Con finals by Oakland, losing 61\u201360 at John Q. Hammons Arena in Tulsa. The Golden Eagles accepted a bid to the NIT\u2014their first post-season berth in eight years\u2014and lost 85\u201372 at Maryland in a nationally televised first-round game. Caleb Green enjoyed a monster sophomore season, earning Mid-Con Player of the Year honors and also capturing Associated Press All-America (HM) honors, the first ORU All-American in over 20 years. Head coach Scott Sutton was honored as the NABC District 12 co-Coach of the Year, sharing the honor with his father, Oklahoma State's Eddie Sutton. ORU picked up several impressive wins, most notably a defeat of Georgetown in the Hawaii Rainbow Classic, and an ESPN Bracket Buster win at Southwest Missouri State. The Golden Eagles handed Tulsa a record-setting 70\u201347 defeat in the annual Mayor's Cup game.\n\n2012 NIT\nThe Golden Eagles went 17\u20131 in The Summit League to be regular season champions but failed to win the Summit League Basketball tournament. As regular season conference champions, they received an automatic bid into the NIT. They lost to WAC regular season champion Nevada in the first round to finish the season 27\u20137.\n\nCBI results\nThe Golden Eagles have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time.

The arena bears the name of John and Lottie Mabee, who established the Tulsa-based Mabee Foundation in 1948. The benevolences of this foundation are evident throughout the Southwest where many edifices bear the name. Mabee Center was built as an elliptical cable-suspension structure with basketball in mind. The arena has 10,575 permanent theater seats - with no obstacles to clear viewing. Recently, four luxury suites were added on the south side or directly behind the team benches. The arena has drawn nine different national tournaments since the building opened. The Golden Eagles themselves played in the first NCAA tournament held here in 1974. Four other NCAA regionals (1975, 1978, 1982 and 1985) have been based at the Mabee Center. The National Invitation Tournament picked ORU as host four times (1977, 1980, 1982 and 1983). Mabee Center also annually hosts the Oklahoma state high school playoffs and the Oklahoma Coaches Association All-Star games. It was also the former site of the NAIA National Basketball Championship. Mabee Center regularly plays host to various conventions, conferences, seminars, and special events such as the annual Miss Oklahoma pageant. In the past, Mabee Center has hosted performers including Elvis Presley, Garth Brooks, Willie Nelson, Reba McEntire and Blue Man Group.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "biography": "The Oregon Ducks men's basketball team is an intercollegiate basketball program that competes in the NCAA Division I and is a member of the Big Ten Conference, representing the University of Oregon. The Ducks play their home games at Matthew Knight Arena, which has a capacity of 12,364. Then coached by Howard Hobson, Oregon won the first NCAA men's basketball national championship in 1939.  They again reached the Final Four in 2017 under head coach Dana Altman, marking the longest span between appearances in NCAA history (79 years). The Ducks have made the NCAA tournament 19 times, and have won eight conference championships.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe University of Oregon men's basketball team played its first season in 1902\u201303 with Charles Burden as the head coach. Only two games were played that season, both against Corvallis State Agricultural College, now known as Oregon State. Oregon lost both games, losing the first one 32\u20132 on the road, and the second one 24\u201322 at home. Oregon did not record a win until its fourth season in 1907 against Roseburg. That season ended with a winning record of 4\u20133, under Hugo Bezdek, who also coached the football team. Bezdek left after that season to coach at Arkansas until 1913 when he went back to Oregon to coach until 1917.\nDuring Bezdek's absence, the basketball team was coached largely by William Hayward, Oregon's track coach. In 1923, Bill Reinhart took over as the head coach and remained through the erection of McArthur Court until 1935. Coach Reinhart suffered only one losing season at Oregon.\n\nThe Tall Firs\nHoward Hobson, an alumnus of the university, became the head coach in 1935, following Reinhart's departure. His ideas were considered cutting edge during his years at Oregon and he was well ahead of his time. He ran a fast break offense little used by anyone else in the country at the time and his defenses were an unorthodox hybrid defense. He lobbied for the installment of a shot clock and three-point field goal years before they were first introduced.\nIn 1939, the Oregon Ducks became the first team to win the NCAA Basketball Championship. Sports editor L. H. Gregory coined the phrase \"Tall Firs\" to describe the Oregon players due to their taller stature compared to other teams in the country.\nThe season started with a long trip to the east coast for a series of games, ending with a loss to Stanford back west in San Francisco. The Ducks went 6\u20133 during that trip but gained valuable experience for the remainder of the season. Oregon went 14\u20132 to claim the North Division title in the Pacific Coast Conference, which set off a best-of-three playoff against the California Golden Bears. The Ducks won two games straight to claim the conference title.\nThe Ducks returned to San Francisco for the NCAA regional series where they defeated the Texas Longhorns in the first game 56\u201341 then the Oklahoma Sooners 55\u201337. The Ohio State Buckeyes had defeated Wake Forest and Villanova in their regional series to earn their right in the championship game. On March 27, Oregon and Ohio State squared off to claim the national title. Oregon emerged victorious to claim the first NCAA national championship trophy, defeating Ohio State 46\u201333.\nHoward Hobson remained as the head coach until 1947 except for a one-year hiatus during the 1944\u201345 season, coached by John Warren.\n\nKamikaze Kids\nThe six decades following the Tall Firs consisted of an eclectic mix of up and down years, with more down than up. From Hobson's departure in 1947 until 1970, Oregon made only two NCAA Tournament appearances, in 1960 and 1961 under head coach Steve Belko. Those were the days when only one team per conference (usually the conference champion) was guaranteed a bid to the NCAA Tournament.  One of Belko's stars was Stan Love, a gifted shooter and rebounder, who led the Pac-8 in scoring for two straight seasons.  He is the father of current NBA star Kevin Love. In 1971, head coach Dick Harter arrived at Oregon and achieved some consistency with the program. Harter's teams were dubbed the Kamikaze Kids and featured hard play, diving for loose balls, and swarming defense. They were also credited for inspiring the intimidating atmosphere at McArthur Court. While they never earned any conference titles due to UCLA's dominance of the Pac-8 (their best finish was second in 1976\u201377), they were not without accomplishments. They assembled two 20 win seasons, appeared in three straight NITs, and upset #1 ranked UCLA in 1974.\nHarter's only losing season in Oregon was his first. He left in 1978 and the Ducks slid, suffering five consecutive losing seasons. Oregon made an appearance in the NCAA tournament in 1995 under head coach Jerry Green, but otherwise accrued largely mediocre records in the two decades after Harter's departure.\n\nErnie Kent era\nIn 1997, Ernie Kent was hired to fill the vacancy at head coach left by Jerry Green. Kent had been one of Harter's Kamikaze Kids, and his teams were known for a similarly up-tempo style of play. In his third season as head coach, he took the Ducks back to the NCAA tournament where they fell in the first round. In 2002, Kent led the Ducks to their first conference championship since 1945, going through the regular season undefeated at home. They earned a number 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament that year and advanced to the Elite Eight by defeating Montana, Wake Forest and Texas. They were eliminated by Kansas and finished the season with a number 11 ranking in the AP Poll. It was Oregon's deepest run in the tournament in 42 years.\nLuke Ridnour was selected as the Pac-10 Player of the Year in 2003 as the Ducks won the Pac-10 tournament, defeating the USC Trojans in the conference championship game 74\u201366. The Ducks entered the NCAA Tournament as an 8 seed and lost to Utah in the first round 60\u201358.\nOregon made a Final Four appearance in the NIT in 2004 but otherwise made little impact until 2007. Oregon swept its 12 intersectional games to start 2007 and upset #1 ranked UCLA in the third Pac-10 game. The Ducks finished the regular season with a 23\u20137 record and defeated Arizona, California, and USC to win the 2007 Pac-10 Tournament. The Ducks earned a #3 seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight by defeating Miami (Ohio) 58\u201356, Winthrop 75\u201361 and University of Nevada, Las Vegas 76\u201372. On March 25, played and lost to the eventual NCAA National Champions, the Florida Gators, by a score of 85\u201377.\nOregon was considered the favorite to land Class of 2007 high school stars Kevin Love and Kyle Singler, widely considered to be the greatest high school players to ever come out of Oregon. Love eventually chose to attend UCLA and Singler chose Duke.\nThe Ducks were selected as a No. 9 seed in the 2008 NCAA tournament in the Southern Region. They lost to No. 8 seed Mississippi State Bulldogs in first-round play on March 21, 2008, in Little Rock, Arkansas.\nOn March 15, 2010, the university announced that the decision had been made to fire Ernie Kent as a result of poor performance in the previous two seasons, placing 9th and 10th in conference in the respective years. Kent departed as the longest tenured Pac-10 coach and winningest coach in school history with 235 wins.\n\nDana Altman era\nIn April 2010, Dana Altman from Creighton University was hired to replace Ernie Kent after a monthlong search. Altman led the Ducks to a CBI championship in his first year at Oregon and led the Ducks to the Sweet 16 during the 2012\u201313 season. Altman led the Ducks back to the NCAA Tournament in the 2013\u201314 season where they defeated BYU but fell to Wisconsin in the round of 32. It was their 12th NCAA tournament appearance and was the first time Oregon won tournament games in back to back seasons in program history. In 2014\u201315, Altman won his 2nd Pac-12 Coach of the Year in three seasons, as he had won the award in 2013. Altman also broke another school record as he became the first coach in Oregon history to go to three consecutive NCAA Tournaments (2013, 2014, 2015). Altman's success continued into the following season as Oregon won the 2015\u201316 regular season title, finishing 14\u20134 in league play. Altman also won the 2015\u20132016 Pac-12 Coach of the Year for the third time in four years. Lute Olson had been the only other coach in Pac-12 history to win the award three times in a four-year span.\nThe 2015\u201316 season was very noteworthy, with the Ducks emerging victorious in the 2015\u201316 Pac-12 Conference Tournament.  This led to the Ducks being the top seed in the West Regional of the 2015\u20132016 NCAA tournament, its first ever top seeding in the NCAA tournament.  The Ducks defeated Holy Cross and Saint Joseph's in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet 16 in Anaheim, where they defeated the number four seed and defending national champion Duke Blue Devils, 82\u201368, to advance to the Elite 8. The following year, the Ducks would go on to be Pac-12 conference co-champions with Arizona, whom they lost to in the championship game of the Pac-12 Tournament. In that year's NCAA Tournament the Ducks would advance all the way to the Final Four, losing to North Carolina by one point.\n\nVenues and facilities\nMcArthur Court was constructed in 1926 and the first Oregon basketball game was played in the arena on January 14, 1927, defeating Willamette University 38\u201310. The arena is located across from Pioneer Cemetery and is named after Clifton McArthur, the first student body president. Even during the Ducks' lean years, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the Pac-10. A group of students known as the \"Pit Crew\" has at times created environments so intimidating that the basket would shake as opponents attempted free throws.\nIn early 2009, the university broke ground on a new $227 million basketball arena designed by TVA Architects to replace McArthur Court. The new arena was named Matthew Knight Arena, after Phil Knight's son who drowned in a scuba diving accident in 2004. The arena is considered to be the front door to the university due to its high-profile location from where the majority of vehicular traffic into the university stems. A primary goal was to create the best collegiate basketball venue in the country though many criticisms arose due to the funding and price tag associated with the design. The hardwood court was named after Patrick Kilkenny, a booster for the university and the former interim athletic director. It had been the subject of much debate upon its opening, due to its unconventional and artistic design. Designer Tinker Hatfield's idea was to pay tribute to the 1939 national championship team, nicknamed \"The Tall Firs\", by creating silhouetted firs around the edges of the court. Matthew Knight Arena opened its doors for the first time on January 13, 2011, with the Ducks defeating the University of Southern California 68\u201362.\n\nIndividual accomplishments\nIndividual National Award Winners\nPlayers\n\nLute Olson Award\nPayton Pritchard (2020)\nBob Cousy Award\nPayton Pritchard (2020)\nJerry West Award\n Chris Duarte  (2021)\nCoaches\n\nJim Phelan Award\nDana Altman (2013)\n\nIndividual Conference Award Winners\nPac-12 Player of the Year\nRon Lee (1975-76)\nTerrell Brandon (1990-91)\nLuke Ridnour (2002-03)\n Joe Young (2014-15)\nDillon Brooks (2016-17)\nPayton Pritchard (2019-20)\nChris Duarte (2020-21) (AP)\nPac-12 Defensive Player of the Year\nJordan Bell (2016-17)\nPac-12 Freshman of the Year\nLuke Ridnour (2000-01)\nPac-12 Tournament Most Outstanding Player\nLuke Ridnour (2003)\nTajuan Porter (2007)\nJohnathan Loyd (2013)\nElgin Cook (2016)\nPayton Pritchard (2019)\nN'Faly Dante (2024)\nPac-12 Coach of the Year\nDick Harter (1976-77)\nErnie Kent (2001-02)\nDana Altman (2012-13)\nDana Altman (2014-15)\nDana Altman (2015-16)\n\nAll-Americans\nThe following players were named first, second or third-team All-Americans by one of outlets used by the NCAA to determine consensus selections\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Ducks have appeared in 19 NCAA tournaments.

    "biography": "The Oregon State Beavers men's basketball program, established in 1901, is the intercollegiate men's basketball program of Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. Members of the West Coast Conference in NCAA Division I, the team plays home games on campus at Gill Coliseum, and the current head coach is Wayne Tinkle.\nOregon State has won 14 conference championships and appeared in the NCAA tournament 18 times (three \n(1980\u201382) were later vacated by the NCAA). The Beavers have advanced to the Final Four twice (1949, 1963), and their most recent tournament appearance was in 2021, when they advanced to the Elite Eight after winning their first tournament games since 1982.\nAs of the 2023 season the Oregon State men's basketball holds the NCAA record for most games played against a single opponent with 362 games played against the Oregon Ducks men's basketball team and the NCAA record for 2nd most victories against a single opponent with 195 victories against the Ducks.\n\nConferences\n^ Pac-12's previous names: AAWU (1959\u20131968), Pacific-8 (1968\u20131978), and Pacific-10 (1978\u20132011)\n\nCoaches\nThe Oregon State men's basketball team has had 21 head coaches, with one interim (2008). Both Amory T. \"Slats\" Gill and Ralph Miller are members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Craig Robinson, the coach preceding Wayne Tinkle, was hired by OSU in 2008 out of Brown University, where he had just coached the Bears to a school-record 19 wins. Robinson is the brother of United States first lady Michelle Obama, and the brother-in-law to United States President Barack Obama. The longest-tenured head coach was Slats Gill, who was the coach for 36 seasons, winning 599 games during his time at OSU. The current coach, Wayne Tinkle, was hired by OSU in 2014 from the University of Montana \u2013 Missoula, where he coached the Montana Grizzlies to two Big Sky Conference championships and a school-record 25 wins.\n\nHistory\n1980\u201383 \u2013 Orange Express\nThe 1980\u201381 Oregon State men's basketball season was arguably one of the best yet most upsetting basketball seasons in Oregon State history. The team was referred to as the Orange Express and was led by Beaver legendary coach Ralph Miller. The Orange Express season was led by Beaver great, Steve Johnson, in his last year at OSU, and the Beavers were second in the final polls, released prior to the NCAA tournament. This was the first time in OSU history that the Beavers won at UCLA, and the Orange Express spent a school record eight weeks ranked first in at least one of the AP and Coaches Polls. At the end of the regular season, the Beavers were 26\u20131 and entered the 48-team NCAA tournament as the top seed in the West region. They had a bye in the first round, but were upset in their opening game by #8 seed Kansas State 50\u201348 in the second round, at Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles.  Miller was awarded UPI and AP Coach of the Year honors and Steve Johnson received All-American honors.\nFor three seasons beginning in 1980\u201381, OSU posted an overall record of 77\u201311 (.875), second only to DePaul's 79\u20136 record over the same seasons. The Beavers' record included a 35\u20131 home record at Gill Coliseum, including a school best 24 consecutive home wins.\nHowever, NCAA sanctions followed these standout teams. The NCAA found that many players, from 1979 to 1983 were involved in improper arrangements with outside representative related to the purchase of complimentary basketball tickets and the receipt of other prohibited benefits. The NCAA vacated appearances from the 1980, 1981, and 1982 tournaments.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Beavers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 18 times. Their combined record is 15\u201321. OSU had three NCAA Tournament appearances (1980, 1981 and 1982) vacated by the NCAA, resulting in 15 recognized appearances and an \"official\" NCAA Tournament record of 13\u201318. Their former 46-year drought between \"official\" tournament wins was the longest drought of any team from a major conference. \n\n* Appearances and results from 1980, 1981, and 1982 were later vacated by the NCAA.\n\nNIT results\nThe Beavers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) four times, with a combined record of 3\u20134.\n\nCBI results\nThe Beavers have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) four times.Their combined record is 7\u20134, and they were the champions in 2009.\n\nCBC results\nThe Beavers have appeared in the College Basketball Crown (CBC) one time. Their record is 0-1.\n\nAll-time record vs. Pac-12 opponents\nNote all-time series includes non-conference matchups.\n\nRivalries\nOregon Ducks \u2014 Oregon State's main rivalry (The Civil War) is with the Ducks. As of the 2023 season the Oregon State men's basketball holds the NCAA record for most games played against a single opponent with 362 games played against the Oregon Ducks men's basketball team and the NCAA record for 2nd most victories against a single opponent with 195 victories against the Ducks. \nWashington Huskies \u2014 The Dog Fight is one of Oregon State's lesser-known rivalry games. As of 2023 they also have played rivals the Washington Huskies men's basketball 310 times (NCAA record 3rd most)  \nWashington State Cougars \u2014 The Land-Grant Rivalry  as land-grant universities, WSU and OSU have a longtime regional rivalry.  As of 2023 they also have played rivals the Washington State Cougars men's basketball 308 times (NCAA record 4th most) and have beaten the Cougars 176 times (NCAA record 6th most)  \nArizona Wildcats \u2013 The Cat's Meow was coined during the 1980's Ralph Miller era when the Beavers would match-up against famed-coach Lute Olson's squad.\n\nNotable players\nOregon State has had 75 all-conference and 32 All-America selections, five Pac-10 Players of the Year, 42 players selected in the NBA draft, and 24 players that have gone on to play in the NBA. Additionally, OSU basketball alumni have 4 gold medals at the Olympics, including one by Lew Beck, who never played in the NBA. A total of 9 players have won 13 NBA titles, including three by A.C.

  "Pittsburgh Panthers": {
    "biography": "The Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball team is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball program of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as \"Pitt\", located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pitt men's basketball team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and plays their home games in the Petersen Events Center. The Panthers were retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion twice by the Helms Athletic Foundation and once by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Pitt has reached one Final Four, received 15 First Team All-American selections, appeared in 27 NCAA tournaments through the 2022\u201323 season, and has recorded 1,674 victories against 1,232 losses since their inaugural season of 1905\u201306.\n\nHistory\nInitial era\nThe University of Pittsburgh began playing men's basketball in 1905\u201306 under coach Benjamin Printz. The University did not field a team during the 1909\u201310 and 1910\u201311 seasons. The program was resurrected in 1911 under head coach Walter \"Dutch\" Wohlfarth, and the following year Dr. George M. Flint assumed head coaching duties and began rebuilding Pitt's program essentially from the ground up. Flint led the Panthers to eight winning seasons during his ten years at the helm and coached future Pitt coach H. C. Carlson.\n\nH.C. \"Doc\" Carlson era (1922\u20131953)\nHenry Clifford \"Doc\" Carlson, MD took over as coach in 1922 and soon turned Pitt into a national power. In the era preceding the initiation of national tournaments, the Panthers were both contemporaneously and later retroactively, by the Helms Athletic Foundation (1927\u201328 and 1929\u201330) and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll (1927\u201328), regarded as national champions. Those teams were led by National Player of the Year, 3-time All-American and Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Charlie Hyatt. Carlson was a ground-breaking coach who would be inducted into the Naismith and Helms Foundation Basketball Hall of Fames. In the late 1920s, Carlson initiated playing a \"national schedule\" by taking his teams on midwestern road trips that included games against several Big Ten schools and, in 1931, is credited as the first coach to take an Eastern team out west. He also developed the widely emulated Figure Eight Offense and also experimented with various conditioning techniques, including the use of oxygen on the bench.  Under Carlson, and led by two-time All-American Claire Cribbs, Pitt continued success through the 1930s winning four Eastern Intercollegiate Conference championships. In 1935, Pitt, as Eastern Intercollegiate champions representing the best of the East, lost a 41\u201337 season-ending contest to SEC champion LSU in the American Legion Bowl in Atlantic City, a game on which LSU bases its claim on that season's national championship. On February 28, 1940, Pitt played in the first-ever televised basketball game, a 57\u201337 victory over Fordham at Madison Square Garden that was televised by NBC station W2XBS. Carlson also led Pitt to its first-ever NCAA appearance en route to the 1941 NCAA Final Four. Carlson's tenure at Pitt's helm lasted for 30 consecutive years before he retired following the 1952\u201353 season.\nPitt moved their competition into the Fitzgerald Field House in 1951, leaving the Pitt Pavilion, housed inside of Pitt Stadium. Pitt would continue to play in the Fieldhouse until 2002.\n\nBob Timmons era (1953\u20131968)\nRobert Timmons took over as head coach from Carlson for the 1953\u201354 season and led by two-time All-American and Helms Foundation Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Don Hennon, appeared in two NCAA tournaments during the late 1950s. Timmons also led Pitt to an NCAA appearance in 1963 and its first NIT appearance in 1964.\n\nBuzz Ridl era (1968\u20131975)\nTimmons was succeeded by head coach Charles \"Buzz\" Ridl who became famous for his 'amoebe' defense, an ever changing man to zone match-up defense. With All-American Billy Knight, Ridl led Pitt to the Elite Eight in 1974, with early round victories over St. Joseph's and Furman. Pitt lost to eventual national champion North Carolina State in the Eastern Regional Final (Elite 8) played in Raleigh, North Carolina amid a hostile local crowd. This Pitt team was filled with local players such as Mickey Martin, Jim Bolla, Tom Richards, Keith Starr, Kirk Bruce and Billy Knight, who went on to star in the ABA for the Indiana Pacers and with several teams in the NBA. Following the graduation of Knight and Martin, Pitt made an NIT appearance the following year, Ridl's last before retiring.\n\nEastern Eight Conference (1976\u20131982)\nFor the 1976\u201377 season, Pitt began play as a member of the Eastern 8 Conference.\n\nTim Grgurich era (1975\u20131980)\nPittsburgh native Tim Grgurich, who was an assistant coach under Ridl, became Pitt's next head coach. He led Pitt into the inaugural 1976\u201377 season of the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League, which would change its name to the Eastern Eight (forerunner to the Atlantic 10) the following year. That initial year, Larry Harris, a 6'6\" forward with an impressive outside shot and an ability to score points in traffic, won the league scoring title. Grgurich also led Pitt to the 1980 NIT.\n\nRoy Chipman era (1980\u20131986)\nGrgurich was succeeded by Lafayette coach Dr. Roy Chipman who began Pitt's rollercoaster-like ride back to national significance. In his first season at the helm, the Panthers won the Eastern Eight Conference tournament. In the 1981 NCAA tournament, Pitt defeated Idaho in overtime in the first round; they lost to North Carolina in the second round. Chipman's Panthers enjoyed similar success the following season, defeating archrival West Virginia for their last Eastern Eight tournament Championship, energized by remarks by WVU Coach Gale Catlett. Pitt lost to Pepperdine in the first round of the 1982 NCAA tournament to end Chipman's second season and Pitt's last as a member of the Eastern Eight Conference.\n\nBig East Conference (1982\u20132013)\nFor the 1982\u201383 season, Pitt began play as a member of the Big East Conference.\n\nPaul Evans era (1986\u20131994)\nChipman would lead Pitt to three more postseason appearances, he retired from coaching after the 86 season and was replaced by Paul Evans as head coach in 1986\u201387. Led by All-Americans Charles Smith and Jerome Lane, Pitt would capture its first two regular season Big East Championships and secure several top 10 rankings reaching as high as number two in the nation. However, compared to the expectations of the fans, these teams had disappointing showings in their Big East and NCAA tournaments appearances. After the departures of Smith and Lane, Pitt basketball continued to have a national, if not inconsistent, impact with players such as Sean Miller, Brian Shorter, Jerry McCullough, and Eric Mobley. In eight seasons as head coach Evans' teams advanced to a total of five NCAA tournaments and one NIT.\n\nRalph Willard era (1994\u20131999)\nSlumping play led to Evans' departure, and he was replaced by Ralph Willard who headed the Pitt program from 1994\u201395 through 1998\u201399. Despite highly regarded recruiting classes and stars such as Mark Blount and Vonteego Cummings, Pitt advanced to only one NIT in five seasons under Willard.\n\nBen Howland era (1999\u20132003)\nBen Howland was hired as head coach of the Panthers in 1999\u201300 and led them to sustained success for 4 seasons. In Howland's second season (2000\u201301), the Pitt team, led by senior standout Ricardo Greer and All-American guard Brandin Knight, advanced to the Big East tournament championship game and NIT. In Howland's third (2001\u201302) and fourth (2002\u201303) seasons, Pitt won back-to-back Big East regular season championships, appeared in back-to-back Big East tournament championship games and won the Big East tournament in 2003. Pitt advanced to consecutive NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteens (2002, 2003). For his success in the 2001\u201302 season, Howland was named the Big East Coach of the Year, Naismith College Coach of the Year, and won the Henry Iba Award as best college basketball coach as named by the United States Basketball Writers Association. Following the 2003 season, Howland left Pitt for the only job he said he would ever contemplate leaving Pitt for: the head coach position at UCLA.\nIn 2002, Pitt began their first season of play at the 12,508-seat Petersen Events Center which sits on the former site of Pitt Stadium. The first opponent at \"the Pete\", as the facility is called by students, was against cross-city rival Duquesne University.\n\nAtlantic Coast Conference (2013\u2013present)\nFor the 2013\u201314 season, Pitt began play as a member of the ACC.\n\nJamie Dixon era (2003\u20132016)\nJamie Dixon, Howland's assistant at Northern Arizona and Pitt, was named head coach of the team in 2003. Under Dixon, the Panthers continued the progress begun under Howland, registering a third straight Big East regular season championship (2004), a fourth straight appearance in the Big East tournament championship game (Pitt 58, UConn 61) and a third straight appearance in the NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteen. With Dixon at the helm, Pitt's success continued with frequent national rankings, four Big East tournament championship game appearances in five seasons (2004, 2006, 2007 2008), a Big East tournament Championship in 2008, and NCAA tournament appearances in nine of ten years under Dixon's leadership (2004\u201311, 2013), including trips to the Sweet Sixteen (2004, 2007, 2009) and Elite Eight (2009).\nThe 2008\u201309 season was notable for several historic accomplishments. The Panthers were ranked #1 in the Associated Press poll and ESPN/USA Today Coaches' poll for the first time in school history, claiming the #1 spot for a total of three weeks. On February 16, 2009, the #4 ranked Panthers defeated the #1 ranked UConn Huskies, 76\u201368, for Pitt's first-ever win versus a #1 ranked team. The Panthers repeated the feat on March 7, 2009, when the #3 ranked Panthers again defeated #1 ranked UConn again, 70\u201360, for Pitt's second-ever win versus a #1 ranked team. In doing so, Pitt became only the seventh school in NCAA Division I history to defeat two #1 ranked teams in the same season. On Selection Sunday, March 15, 2009, the Panthers received their first ever No.1 seed (East Region) in the 2009 NCAA tournament. They reached the Elite Eight for the first time since 1974. Pitt's 78\u201376 last second loss to fellow Big East Conference foe Villanova in the East Regional final for a trip to the Final Four became an instant classic. In 2009, Dixon broke the record for the most victories in the first six seasons as a Division I head coach and won the Naismith Coach of the Year award.\n\nThe success of the 2008\u201309 season continued over to the 2009\u201310 season, somewhat unexpectedly. Having lost the talents of Sam Young, DeJuan Blair and Levance Fields, the Panthers were picked in a pre-season Big East poll to finish ninth in the conference. Instead, Pitt earned a 13\u20135 Big East record, good enough for a second seed in the Big East tournament, received a third seed in the NCAA tournament, and finished 25\u20139 overall record. In 2010\u201311, Pitt won the regular season Big East title and, for a second time in the program's history, earned a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament.\nThe program achieved a school record 10-straight seasons with at least 20 overall wins, 10 conference wins, and an NCAA Tournament appearance from 2002 through 2011. Dixon, who has been named as a national coach of the year in three separate seasons, guided Pitt to NCAA Tournament appearances in his first eight seasons as head coach, and is the only head coach in school history to guide Pitt to eight NCAA Tournament appearances (2004\u20132011).\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference announced in September 2011 that Pitt and Syracuse would be leaving the Big East and had been accepted as members of the ACC, which would grow from 12 to 14 teams. Pitt officially joined the ACC on July 1, 2013.\nIn 2011\u201312, Pitt failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament, but managed to again surpass 20 wins for the 11th consecutive season and qualify for the College Basketball Invitational for a 12th consecutive post-season appearance. Pitt defeated Washington State in the Finals in a best 2 out of 3 format to win the post-season tournament.\nDixon's record at Pitt stood at 262 wins and 86 losses (.753 win percentage) in ten seasons (2003\u201304 through 2012\u201313), second in school history behind only Carlson. His league record of 127\u201366 in ten seasons made him the winningest coach in Big East history with a .658 winning percentage in league games and tournaments.\nOn March 31, 2010, Pitt extended Dixon's contract by two years, making him Pitt's head coach through 2017\u201318 season. Dixon signed another contract extension on March 23, 2013. This extension ran through the 2022\u20132023 season. Upon the extension, Dixon commented saying that his intentions were to \"finish his career at the University of Pittsburgh.\" Dixon, however, departed to take the head coaching position at his alma mater, TCU, on March 21, 2016, after Pitt grew dissatisfied with his team's results and  lowered his contract buyout clause to make it easier for him to leave.\n\nKevin Stallings era (2016\u20132018)\nOn March 28, 2016, the school hired Vanderbilt head coach Kevin Stallings to fill the vacant head coaching position. Pitt went 16\u201317 and finished 14th in the ACC, its first losing season in 17 years. The Panthers notably lost to Duquesne for the first time since 2000 and suffered a 106\u201351 loss to Louisville, their worst loss since 1906. The disappointing season was punctuated by a blowout home loss to #1 Virginia on senior night, during which the Panthers managed only 7 first half points against the Cavaliers. In Stallings's second season, Pitt went 8\u201324 and went 0\u201318 in ACC conference play. Pitt finished 15th, last in the conference. The season's 19-game losing streak was the worst in Pitt history. Further, this was the only season in Pitt's history where they were winless in conference play. On March 8, 2018, Pitt fired Stallings.\n\nJeff Capel era (2018\u2013present)\nOn March 27, 2018, Duke associate head coach Jeff Capel reached an agreement to become the 16th head basketball coach at Pitt. Capel previously served as head coach at VCU (2002\u201306) and Oklahoma (2006\u201311). In the 2022-23 season, the Panthers finished with a regular season record of 21\u201310 and made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in six years. The 11-seed Panthers defeated Mississippi State 60\u201359 in the First Four and 6-seed Iowa State 59\u201341 in the first round before suffering a loss to 3-seed Xavier by a score of 84\u201373.\n\nTraditions\nStudent section\nThe \"Oakland Zoo\" is the student cheering section for the men's and women's basketball teams. The Zoo cheers on the Panthers from the bottom tier of the stands at the Petersen Events Center, primarily across from the teams' benches and on the baselines under the baskets. The \"Pete\" holds a rowdy crowd of 1,500 students that are typically uniformly clad in gold t-shirts, and the Zoo student section is consistently sold out for Panthers home games. The Oakland Zoo is named after Oakland, the neighborhood in which the university is located. The name \"Oakland Zoo\" is used for the basketball cheering sections only; the football cheering section has often used the title, \"The Panther Pitt.\"\n\nRivalries\nWest Virginia\nThe fiercest rivalry was with former Big East Conference member West Virginia University in the basketball version of the Backyard Brawl, an extension of the football rivalry.  Adding to the importance of the game, Pitt and West Virginia shared membership in the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference (1933\u20131939), the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League West Division (1977), Eastern 8 Conference (1978\u20131982), and the Big East Conference (1996\u20132012). In addition, the two rivals have tangled in the last games played at three of their respective arenas: on February 26, 1951, Pitt defeated WVU 74\u201372 in the closing seconds of the last college game played at the Pitt Pavilion inside Pitt Stadium; on March 3, 1970, Pitt upset WVU 92\u201387 in the last game played at the West Virginia University Field House in Morgantown; and on March 2, 2002, Pitt defeated WVU 92\u201365 in Pitt's last game at Fitzgerald Field House. The two teams met in conference play for the last time on February 16, 2012, resulting in a 66\u201348 Mountaineer victory. \nAfter five seasons without playing, the schools resumed their series in 2017 with a 69-60 win by the Mountaineers. They have since met in out-of-conference play every year since as of 2024. As of 2024, the school have met 193 times, with West Virginia leading the series 103-90. Pitt's 193 games against the Mountaineers are its most against any opponent.\n\nPenn State\nAnother spill-over from the gridiron, the Panthers' third-most frequently-played opponent is the Penn State Nittany Lions, whom they have played 148 times. Penn State leads the all-time series, 76\u201372. They played at least once every year from 1935\u201382 and briefly rekindled the rivalry at the turn of the century, playing annually from 2000\u201305. Since that time, they\u2019ve gone against each other just twice, in 2013 as part of the Big Ten-ACC Challenge, and in the 2016 Never Forget Tribute Classic. They are not scheduled to renew the series in the foreseeable future, though there have been significant talks between the universities about doing so.\n\nDuquesne\nThe Panthers also have a sustained rivalry with crosstown opponent Duquesne University in The City Game. Peaking in ferocity from 1977\u20131982 when both were members of the Eastern Eight Conference, the rivalry has diminished somewhat since Pitt's move to the Big East Conference in 1982.\n\nSyracuse\nA spillover from their football rivalry, the Panthers and Syracuse University also maintain a rivalry on the hardwood. The series intensified during the first decade of this century, during which both teams were highly competitive in the Big East and made numerous appearances in both the AP Top 10 and NCAA Tournament. They continue to play at least twice each season as members of the ACC.\n\n2-time National Champions\nPitt men's basketball teams of 1927\u201328 (21\u20130) and 1929\u201330 (23\u20132) were recognized as national champions both popularly and by the Helms Athletic Foundation. These teams of \"Doc\" Carlson, led by three-time All-American and two-time National Scoring Champion Charley Hyatt, played a \"national\" schedule that during the 1927\u201328 season that included the following wins:\n\nThe 1929\u201330 national championship team racked up wins that included the following:\n\nAlthough there was no NCAA Tournament at that time, there were contests billed as \"National Championship Games\". The 1930 game in particular helped Pittsburgh legend Charley Hyatt cement his place in history by scoring 27 points, including a last second game-winning shot, at the defending national champions and assumed #1 squad Montana State.\n\nEarly-season national tournaments\nStarting with the NCAA rule change regarding exempt tournaments in the 2006\u201307 season, Pitt has participated in an event every year, with the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Panthers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 27 times. Their combined record is 25\u201328.\n\nNCAA Tournament Seeding History\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nNIT results\nThe Panthers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) nine times. Their combined record is 6\u20139.\n\nCBI results\nThe Panthers have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time. Their record is 5\u20131 and they were CBI champions in 2012.\n\nConference Championships\n1932\u201333 Eastern Intercollegiate Champions\n1933\u201334 Eastern Intercollegiate Champions\n1934\u201335 Eastern Intercollegiate Champions\n1936\u201337 Eastern Intercollegiate Champions\n1980\u201381 Eastern 8 Tournament Champions\n1981\u201382 Eastern 8 Tournament Champions\n1986\u201387 Big East Regular Season Co-Champions\n1987\u201388 Big East Regular Season Champions\n2001\u201302 Big East Regular Season West Champions\n2002\u201303 Big East tournament and Regular Season West Co-Champions\n2003\u201304 Big East Regular Season Champions\n2007\u201308 Big East tournament champions\n2010\u201311 Big East Regular Season Champions\nPitt was the only team in Big East Conference history to reach the Big East Championship Game seven times in eight seasons having earned a trip to the title game in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008.[1] Pitt played in the Eastern 8 Tournament Championship games in 1979, 1981, and 1982.\n\nIndividual awards & honors\nNational honors\nNational Player of the Year\nCharley Hyatt won the National Player of the Year in 1929\u201330, he was the America's leading scorer that season (his second time as leading scorer) and made a last second basket to win the National Title Game with 27 points against what many considered the best team in the country.  This season was also to be the third consecutive time he had earned consensus All-American status (the second time he won the honor owing to him being in the inaugural class of consensus in his second season).\n\nNational Coach of the Year\n2001\u201302: Ben Howland won National Coach of the Year honors from the Associated Press, Naismith, USBWA, ESPN The Magazine, and The Sporting News.\n2008\u201309: Jamie Dixon won the Naismith Men's College Basketball Coach of the Year as well as the Jim Phelan Mid-season Coach of the Year award.\n2009\u201310: Jamie Dixon won the Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Award.\n2010\u201311: Jamie Dixon won the Sporting News National Coach of the Year award.\n\nHall of Fame inductees\nThree inductees represent the University of Pittsburgh in the Helms Foundation Basketball Hall of Fame; two of them, Carlson and Hyatt, are also represented in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. Both Carlson and Hyatt were selected as the first class inducted to each hall.\n\nHenry Clifford \"Doc\" Carlson, M.D., Pitt head coach from 1922 to 1953.  He is noted as the innovator of the \"figure 8\" play, the first coach to take his team cross country and a leading advocate for intersectional games.  Despite great modern eras in Pitt basketball (late 1950s, mid 1970s, 1980s, 2000s), he continues to be the winningest coach in program history as well as the only one to lead the program to national championships.\nCharley Hyatt, Pitt player and three-time All-American and two-time national scoring leader, he also was a senior year All American in High School and earned three other all-pro awards in the pre-NBA era playing after Pitt. He was a member of the very first Consensus All American team in 1929.\nDon Hennon, two-time All-American (with one being a Consensus All American), led Pitt to two NCAA Tournament bids.\n\nAll Americans\nThirteen Pitt players have received All-American honors 14 unique season. Pitt players have been named First Team\u2020 All-Americans 15 times, Second Team All-Americans seven times, and Third Team All-Americans six times. In addition, players have been named as Freshman All-Americans four times and Honorable Mention All-Americans six times.  A Pitt player has achieved Consensus First Team All-American, as listed in the Official NCAA Records Book, on nine occasions. Charley Hyatt and Sykes Reed, who together lead Pitt to an undefeated national championship season, were Pitt's first Consensus All-Americans in 1928.  The other consensus first-team All-Americans include Don Smith, Claire Cribbs, Don Hennon, and DeJuan Blair. In addition, Don Hennon, Billy Knight and Jerome Lane received Consensus Second Team All-American status.\n\nAcademic awards\nTwo Pitt players have earned Academic All-American status from the College Sports Information Directors of America.

  "Providence Friars": {
    "biography": "The Providence Friars men's basketball team represents Providence College in NCAA Division I competition. They were a founding member of the original Big East Conference from 1979 until 2013, and are now a member of the current Big East Conference. They play their home games at the Amica Mutual Pavilion  in Providence, Rhode Island.\nThe Friars have made two Final Four appearances in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, in 1973 and 1987. Four former players or coaches \u2013 Dave Gavitt, John Thompson, Rick Pitino, and Lenny Wilkens \u2013 are enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In addition, two-time NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament champion, current Chicago Bulls head coach Billy Donovan, helped lead the Friars (as a player) to the Final Four in 1987.\n\nHistory\nEarly years: 1921-1955\nProvidence Friars basketball can be traced back to 1921, when the four-year-old school fielded its first basketball team on an informal basis. This first team only lasted two years, however, and did not return until the 1926\u201327 season when Archie Golembeski, the school's football coach, led to the team to a win over St. John's before devoting his time to football the next year. He was replaced by Al McClellan, who coached the team to four New England championships \u2014 1929, 1930, 1932, and 1935 \u2014 and had an overall winning percentage over .700. In 1938, McClellan left and was replaced by Ed Crotty, who led the team to a 15\u20135 record in 1942\u201343 before the team suspended play the next year after the outbreak of World War II. After the war, the NCAA divided its teams into two divisions, the University Division and the College Division; with a smaller enrollment and no home court (the team played in an on-campus auditorium and then local high school gyms), the Friars were placed into the College Division and no longer faced the opponents they once played.\n\nMullaney era: 1955-1969\nIn 1949, Vin Cuddy was hired as the team's head coach, leading the team to a 14\u20139 record in his first season and qualified for the NAIB regional tournament in 1951, behind the school's first 1,000-point scorer, Jim Schlimm. By 1955, Cuddy's record fell to 9\u201312 and he was replaced by Joe Mullaney; at the same time, the school opened its first on-campus gym, Alumni Hall. In 1959, Mullaney and the Friars defeated ranked Villanova on the road, leading to their first-ever National Invitational Tournament bid.\nThe Friars reached the NIT Finals in 1960 with future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens being named MVP in his senior season before winning the tournament in 1961 behind Vin Ernst, John Egan, and Jim Hadnot. Two years later (1963), led by another future hall of famer, John Thompson, as well as future Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, the Friars won their second NIT title. With a 24\u20132 record in 1964\u201365, the number four ranked Friars reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In 1966\u201367, Jimmy Walker led the nation in scoring and became the school's first 2,000-point scorer as well as the first New England player selected first overall in the NBA draft. That season also marked the last in Mullaney's run of nine consecutive 20-win seasons. Two years later, Mullaney was hired as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA.\n\nGavitt era: 1969-1979\nFollowing Mullaney's departure, Dave Gavitt, an assistant under Mullaney who then became head coach at Dartmouth, took over as the Friars' head coach in 1969. In his second year, Gavitt began a string of eight consecutive 20-win seasons. For the 1972\u201373 season, the team began playing in downtown Providence at the brand-new 12,000-seat arena, the Providence Civic Center (renamed the Dunkin' Donuts Center in 2001). That season was the Friars' best to date; led by Ernie DiGregorio and the troubled center Marvin Barnes, the team went on a 17-team game winning streak that ended in a Final Four loss to Memphis State. The next year, the Friars posted a 28\u20134 record and made their second straight Sweet Sixteen appearance. The team continued its top-flight status with back-to-back 20-win seasons in 1976\u201377 and 1977\u201378, earning NCAA tournament bids each year, one coming after defeating top-ranked Michigan in 1976. After a 10\u201316 season in 1978\u201379, Gavitt left Providence to become the first commissioner of the Providence-based Big East Conference. He finished his 10-year career at Providence with a 209\u201384 (.713) record.\n\nMullaney returns: 1979-1985\nAfter spending the first six decades of their existence as an independent, the Friars joined the Big East in its inaugural season, 1979\u201380. The conference originally consisted of Providence, Boston College, Georgetown, St. John's, Seton Hall, Syracuse, and Connecticut. New head coach Gary Walters led the team to an 11\u201316 record in 1979\u201380, and was replaced by Mullaney in 1981. His next stint with the Friars would not be as successful, and consisted of only one winning season (1983\u201384, behind Otis Thorpe) against three losing.\n\nPitino era: 1985-1987\nIn 1985, New York Knicks assistant coach Rick Pitino was hired as the latest Friars head coach. In his first season the Friars compiled a 17\u201314 record and made their first NIT appearance in a decade. The next year, 1986\u201387, the Friars posted a 25\u20139 record behind Billy Donovan and made their second-ever Final Four appearance in the 1987 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. After losing to Syracuse, Pitino left the school and re-joined the Knicks as their head coach in 1987. The Friars have not returned to the Final Four since Pitino's departure.\n\nChiesa, Barnes, Gillen: 1987-1998\nIn 1987\u201388, the Friars posted a losing record under new head coach Gordie Chiesa, who was replaced by Rick Barnes after the season. Behind Barnes and 2,000-point scorer Eric Murdock, the Friars made back-to-back NCAA tournament appearances in 1989 and 1990, as well as an NIT bid in 1991. Following Murdock's departure and a losing season in 1991\u201392, the team had an NIT semifinal appearance in 1993 and an NCAA tournament appearance in 1994, while also capturing the school's first Big East Tournament title. Following back-to-back 20-win seasons, Barnes left to become the head coach at Clemson in 1994. He was replaced by Pete Gillen. Led by Eric Williams, the Friars made consecutive NIT appearances in 1995 and 1996. In 1996\u201397, the Friars posted a 24\u201312 record, led by Austin Croshere and Jamel Thomas. After defeating Duke in the 1997 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the Friars reached the Elite Eight before losing, in overtime, to eventual champion Arizona. Following a losing season in 1997\u201398, Gillen departed to become the head coach at Virginia.\n\nWelsh era: 1998-2008\nGillen was replaced by Iona head coach Tim Welsh in 1998. Led by Thomas, the Friars made an NIT bid in 1999. The team returned to the NCAA tournament two years later, posting a 21\u201310 record behind John Linehan. While the Friars posted a losing record in Linehan's senior season in 2001\u201302, the guard broke Allen Iverson's single-season Big East steals record of 67 as well as Murdock's NCAA career steals record of 377. Led by Ryan Gomes, the Friars returned to the NIT with an 18\u201314 record in 2002\u201303 and made another NCAA appearance in 2003\u201304 with a 20\u20139 record. However, Welsh's next four teams, without Gomes after 2004\u201305, recorded one winning season, and Welsh was fired following the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nDavis era: 2008-2011\nIn 2008, the Friars hired Drake head coach Keno Davis, who won the National Coach of the Year Award in his first and only season as Drake's head coach. Davis' team posted a 19\u201314 record, including a win at home over top-ranked Pittsburgh, in 2008\u201309 en route to an NIT appearance. In 2009\u201310, Davis' team lost their final 11 games to finish 15th in the Big East. The Friars averaged 82 points per game, the fourth highest in Division I, while also surrendering 85 points per conference game, the worst statistical performance in Big East history. In Davis' third season, 2010\u201311, the Friars finished 14th in the conference despite having Division I's second-leading scorer in Marshon Brooks. Davis was fired after the 2010\u201311 season.\n\nCooley era: 2011-2023\nOn March 22, 2011, the Friars hired Fairfield head coach Ed Cooley, as the 15th head coach in program history. A Providence native, Cooley brought a reinvigorated energy surrounding the program and recruited six consensus Top 100 recruits in his first three years.\n\n2011\u201312 season\nIn his first season at Providence, Cooley led the Friars to a 15\u201317 mark overall, posting an 11\u20133 mark (8\u20130 at home) in non-conference action and going 4\u201314 in the Big East. That season, point guard Vincent Council was named All-Big East Third Team and forward LaDontae Henton earned Big East All-Rookie Team accolades.\n\n2012\u201313 season \u2014 NIT quarterfinals\nIn his second season, Cooley led the Friars to a 19\u201315 record overall and a 9\u20139 mark in league play. Included in the 9\u20139 Big East record in 2012\u201313 was a 7\u20132 mark over the last nine games of the conference season, marking the second best turnaround over second half of the season in Big East history. The Friars played the season with a short roster with transfers Carson Desrosier and Tyler Harris having to sit out the year per NCAA transfer rules, five star Freshman shooting guard and Providence native Ricky Ledo sitting our per NCAA eligibility issues, and five star Freshman point guard Kris Dunn sitting out the first semester with a shoulder injury.  Friars Freshman guard Josh Fortune, was the only incoming player in 2012\u20132013 season eligible to compete.  Cooley guided the Friars to the NIT where the squad posted a 2\u20131 record, beating Charlotte and Robert Morris before losing in the quarterfinals to eventual NIT Champion Baylor. That season, combo guard Bryce Cotton was named All-Big East First Team and Kadeem Batts was recognized as a co-winner of the league's Most Improved Award and earned All-Big East Honorable Mention accolades. After spending one year at Providence without being able to play, Ledo declared for the 2013 NBA Draft and was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves, eventually being traded to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\n2013\u201314 season \u2014 Big East tournament champions / NCAA tournament first round\nIn his third season at Providence, Cooley led the Friars to a 10\u20138 mark in the Big East Conference and finished tied for 3rd with Xavier and St. John's.  Transfers, Junior forward Carson Desrosiers and Sophomore forward Tyler Harris, were eligible to play their first season in black and white, having sat out the NCAA-enforced one-year period. However, in addition to former Senior point guard Vincent Council's graduation and Ricky Ledo entering the draft, Sophomore point guard Kris Dunn faced another shoulder injury and had to sit out almost the entire year as a medical redshirt, Cleveland State transfer Sophomore guard Junior Lamomba had to sit out the NCAA-enforced one-year period, and incoming Freshmen Brandon Austin and Rodney Bullock were suspended for the entire season due to an unspecified violation of team rules.  The Friars finished the season at 23\u201312 overall, the most wins in a season since 1996\u20131997. Two players received regular season honors, Senior point guard Bryce Cotton was named All-Big East First Team and Senior forward Kadeem Batts earned All-Big East Second Team accolades. Entering the Big East Tournament, the Friars played as the 4th seed due to losing the tie-breaker with Xavier. They defeated St. John's in the Quarterfinals, Seton Hall in the semifinals, and Creighton in the thrilling final at Madison Square Garden, claiming PC's second tournament title in Big East history. By winning the Big East Tournament the team earned an automatic bid, removing any \"bubble\" fears.  On their way to making history as the first tournament champion of the reconfigured league, Junior forward Ladontae Henton was named to the All-Tournament Team and Senior guard Bryce Cotton was named the tournaments Most Outstanding Player. On selection Sunday, the Friars were given the 11th seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament East Regional and faced the UNC.  The Friars lost 77\u201379, but en route Bryce Cotton scored a career high 36 points, making him the 4th all-time leading scorer in Providence College basketball history. Despite the loss, the season marked yet another major step forward by Ed Cooley & Co. in rebuilding the PC basketball program.\n\n2021\u20132022 season \u2014 Big East regular season champions / NCAA tournament\nAfter a disappointing campaign the previous season marred by a COVID-19 shortened schedule and no fans, Ed Cooley led the Friars to their first regular season championship in Big East History with an overall record of 24\u20134 and 14\u20133 within the conference. The Friars clinched the title at home in front of a sold out Dunkin Donuts Center crowd. The Friars spent most of this season ranked in the AP and Coaches top 25 Polls reaching as high as 8/9 on Feb 14, 2022.\n\n2022-2023 season \u2014 Coach Cooley's final season with the Friars\nThe Friars finished their season with a 13\u20137 record in Big East play and a 21\u201312 record overall, including a loss to UConn in the Big East tournament quarterfinals and a First Round loss to the University of Kentucky in the NCAA tournament. On March 20, 2023, Coach Cooley resigned as head coach at Providence to become the head coach at Georgetown University. He was replaced by Kim English. Cooley's decision to leave Providence prompted intense backlash from students and fans that was described as \"racially charged, abusive and intrusive.\"\n\nCurrent team\nRoster\nCoaching Staff\nSeason-by-season\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Friars have appeared in the NCAA tournament 22 times.

played almost all of its home basketball games at the arena since it opened. The Amica Mutual Pavilion took over naming rights in 2022. The Amp (formerly Providence Civic Center and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Center (aka \"The Dunk\") ) is an indoor arena, located in downtown Providence, Rhode Island, and seats approximately 12,410 fans for basketball games.  In 2001, the arena was named the Dunkin' Donuts Center as part of a naming-rights deal with Dunkin' Donuts. Ironically they served Dunkin coffee but no actual Donuts. In December 2005, the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority purchased the building from the city of Providence and spent $80 million on an extensive renovation connecting it indoor to the Convention center and a nearby luxury hotel. Renovations were also inclusive of a new Jumbotron, luxury suites, HVAC chiller, upgraded concessions, concourse updates, new seating bowl and other amenities.  Since the renovations, the arena has been touted as one of the most state of the art arenas and one of the best atmospheres in the NCAA. The fans are known for being knowledgeable of basketball, and hostile to visiting teams and coaches. This has resulted in one of the best home records in D1 basketball since 2021-2022.  Prior to playing at the Amica Mutual Pavilion, the Friars played on campus at Alumni Hall (Providence) from 1955 until moving to the AMP in 1972.  Alumni Hall seated approximately 2,600 fans from 1955 until its renovation in 2012, and now seats approximately 1,850 fans.\n\nRivalries\nVillanova Wildcats\nThe two smallest schools in the original Big East, Providence and the Villanova Wildcats, currently battle at least twice each year during conference play. The two teams first met on February 15, 1936, resulting in a 46\u201337 Friars victory. Villanova leads the all-time series, 67-42 since 1949-1950. The rivalry is elevated by the Catholic orders which run the schools; Providence's Dominicans and Villanova's Augustinians.\n\nBoston College Eagles\nThese two former Big East rivals are in adjacent states with both teams said to have among the most intense fans in New England. Though they now reside in separate conferences, they still meet occasionally during non-conference play.\n\nConnecticut Huskies\nThe only two New England schools in the old Big East for its final eight seasons, these two schools fought for New England bragging rights each year until the 2013 season, when Providence and 6 other teams in the \"Catholic 7\" broke away to form the new Big East and UConn remained in the now-called American Athletic Conference. UConn joined the new Big East and started playing in the conference in 2020, renewing the rivalry.\n\nRhode Island Rams\nThe annual Rhode Island State Championship game is played between these schools once a year and is considered often to be the highlight of the schedule for the Rams. The game now alternates annually between Providence (The Amp)  and Kingston The Ryan Center always resulting in a rare home sellout for Rhode Island in their year hosting. The annual match-up is usually played in December and has produced many memorable games and moments for both teams over the years. In recent years Providence has dominated the rivalry and holds a commanding 64-26 advantage since 1949-1950\n\nParticipations in FIBA competitions\n1977 FIBA Intercontinental Cup: 6th place\n\nSocial Media\nProvidence basketball has a presence and notable fan following on:\nfacebook\nInstagram\nX (formerly twitter)\nThe Friartown following on X (formerly twitter) uses #pcbb\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "biography": "The Purdue Boilermakers basketball team is a men's college basketball program that competes in NCAA Division I and is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference.\nPurdue basketball has the most Big Ten regular season championships with 26 conference titles, and in 2024 became the first Big Ten program to be ranked as the #1 team in America for three consecutive seasons. As of April 2024, Purdue also holds a winning record against all other Big Ten schools in head-to-head match ups.\nThe Boilermakers have reached three NCAA Tournament Final Fours and two NCAA championship games, but have not won an NCAA Championship. The 1931\u201332 team was retroactively named a national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Purdue has sent more than 30 players to the NBA, including two overall No. 1 picks in the NBA draft.\nPurdue's main rival is the Indiana Hoosiers.\n\nHistory\n1896\u20131916: The early years\nThe history of Purdue basketball dates back to 1896 with their first game against the Lafayette YMCA, which they won 34\u201319. In the 1902\u201303 season, head coach C.I. Freeman, in his only season, led them to an undefeated 8\u20130 record. Upon conclusion of the season, the university recognized the popularity of the sport and made it part of the Purdue University Athletic Association. The Boilermakers began play in the Big Ten Conference three years later, with its first championship coming in 1911 under the direction of Ralph Jones.\n\n1917\u20131946: Ward Lambert era\nIn 1917, Ward \"Piggy\" Lambert, a former basketball player at Wabash College, was named head coach of the Boilermakers. What followed was one of the most dominant eras of Purdue Basketball on the conference and national level. Under Lambert, Purdue became a front-runner in the development of the fast-paced game as it is today. In 28 seasons, Lambert mentored 16 All-Americans and 31 First Team All-Big Ten selections, which included the 1932 National Player of the Year John Wooden. Wooden was the first college player to be named a Consensus All-American three times. Lambert compiled a career record of 371\u2013152, a .709 winning percentage. His 228 wins in Big Ten play have been bested by only Indiana's Bob Knight, Michigan State's Tom Izzo, Purdue's current head coach Matt Painter, and former Purdue head coach Gene Keady. Lambert won an unprecedented 11 Big Ten Championships, which Bobby Knight later tied for most in conference history. In 1943, the Helms Athletic Foundation retroactively recognized Purdue as its national champion for 1932. The Premo-Porretta Power Poll later recognized the Boilermakers as the 1932 national champion as well.\n\n1950\u20131965: Ray Eddy era\nWard Lambert announced his resignation on January 23, 1946. That same year and the year following, under new head coach Mel Taube, Purdue won both meetings against coach John Wooden's Indiana State team. On February 24, 1947, three students were killed (one of whom died the next day) and 166 people were taken to hospitals after the 3,400-student section of the Purdue Fieldhouse collapsed during a game against Wisconsin.\nCenter Paul Hoffman became the only Boiler to be named a First Team-All Big Ten selection four times in 1947. With third overall-picked teammate Ed \"Bulbs\" Ehlers (who played for John Wooden at South Bend Central High School), the two were the first players in the program's history to be selected in the NBA draft, while Paul Hoffman became the BAA's (original title of the NBA) first player named Rookie of the Year in 1948.\nAfter Mel Taube's four-and-a-half seasons, Ray Eddy, a former player and teammate of Wooden's under Lambert, took over as head coach. During his 15-year tenure, he coached Terry Dischinger and Dave Schellhase, both Consensus All-Americans, and Ernie Hall, the first Purdue junior college transfer and African-American player to wear a Boilermaker uniform. In 1955, his team played one of the longest games in college basketball history, lasting six overtimes in a loss to Minnesota.\n\n1966\u20131979: George King era\nOver the next few decades the Boilermakers enjoyed moderate success, culminating in 1969 when they won their first conference title in 29 years and advanced to the 1969 NCAA Finals game under head coach George King and led by All-American Rick Mount, where they fell to former Purdue great John Wooden and his UCLA Bruins squad. Former Los Angeles Lakers coach/general manager, Fred Schaus, who also spent time as West Virginia's head coach, took over the program after George King stepped down to become solely the school's athletic director. Schaus led the Boilermakers to the 1974 NIT Championship, becoming the first Big Ten team to capture the NIT title. In the 1978\u201379 season, new head coach Lee Rose introduced Purdue basketball to a new approach with a slowed-down, controlled style of play. With All-American center Joe Barry Carroll, he led them to the 1979 NIT Finals and to a 1980 NCAA Final Four appearance.\n\n1980\u20132005: Gene Keady era\nIn 1980, Gene Keady, the head coach of Western Kentucky and former assistant to Eddie Sutton with the Arkansas Razorbacks, was named the new head coach of the Boilermakers. Over the next 25 years, Keady led the Boilermakers to six Big Ten Championships, 17 NCAA Tournament appearances with two Elite Eights and no Final Fours. Purdue received their highest Associated Press and Coaches Poll ranking in its program's history during the 1987\u201388 season, where they were ranked as high as 2nd in the nation.  They were ranked 1st in the nation during the 2021\u20132022 season. In 1991, Keady and assistant coach Frank Kendrick recruited Glenn Robinson, who ultimately became an All-American and Purdue's second-named National Player of the Year. A few years later, Purdue managed to recruit the program's first of several foreign players when they picked up Matt ten Dam from the Netherlands. In December 1997, Keady became Purdue's all-time winningest head coach, surpassing Lambert with his 372nd win. He also became the second-winningest coach in Big Ten history behind Indiana's Bobby Knight, against whom Keady went 21\u201320 in head-to-head meetings. Soon afterward, the playing surface at Mackey Arena was named Keady Court in his honor.\nMany of Keady's former assistant coaches and players throughout the years have gone on to enjoy success as head coaches. Included in the Gene Keady coaching tree is current Purdue head coach Matt Painter, former St. John's head coach Steve Lavin, former Pittsburgh head coach Kevin Stallings, former Kansas State head coach Bruce Weber, former Wisconsin-Green Bay head coach Linc Darner, former UNC Charlotte head coach Alan Major, former Missouri and current Missouri State head coach Cuonzo Martin, former Missouri State head coach and current Purdue assistant coach Paul Lusk, and former Illinois State head coach Dan Muller.\nFollowing the 1998\u201399 season, the NCAA placed Purdue on two years' probation due to minor violations over recruiting, benefits, and ethics. Purdue also lost one scholarship per season for the 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302 seasons. Most severely, Purdue assistant Frank Kendrick was found to have provided an illegal benefit to Purdue player Luther Clay, who transferred to Rhode Island after his freshman year, namely a $4,000 bank loan. Clay was found to be ineligible due to his extra benefit, so Purdue forfeited all 19 victories in which Clay played, including one win in the 1996 NCAA tournament.\n\n2005\u2013present: Matt Painter era\nAs the Keady era came to a close in 2005, the Matt Painter era began. Painter played for Keady during the early 1990s, with Keady naming him captain in his senior year in 1993. After one season at Southern Illinois as the head coach after Bruce Weber left north for Illinois, Painter was hired as a planned replacement for Coach Keady for the 2004\u201305 season as Keady's associate head coach. After a disappointing first season marred with injuries and suspensions from off-court altercations, Painter re-energized Purdue basketball in the summer of 2006 by signing the top recruiting class in the conference and made one of the biggest turnarounds in the program's history. His \"Baby Boilers\" developed into three eventual All-Americans, including 2011 consensus selection JaJuan Johnson, that led Purdue to four consecutive NCAA Tournaments and back-to-back Sweet Sixteen appearances, a Big Ten title, and a conference tournament championship. During the 2010 season, Matt Painter led the Boilermakers to a school record-tying 14\u20130 start, as well with the most wins in a season with a 29\u20136 record and a Big Ten title. The season ended in relative disappointment, however, as Junior Robbie Hummel was sidelined with an ACL injury in February of that season.  The following year, and with the anticipated return of Hummel, E'Twaun Moore, and Johnson, Purdue looked poised to have one of its program's finest seasons.  This excitement was quickly tempered when Hummel re-tore his ACL on the first practice of the season, sidelining him for its duration once again. Despite Hummel's absence, Purdue remained in the top ten most of the season, being ranked as high as 6th and finished the regular season with a 26\u20138 record.  At the conclusion of the 2010\u20132011 season, Johnson and Moore declared for the NBA draft. On June 23, 2011, both Johnson and Moore were drafted to the Boston Celtics in the first and second rounds, respectively. Purdue began the 2012 season with a 12\u20133 record, holding the fifth best home winning streak in the nation with 27, before leading the nation with the fewest turnover average per game. The home winning streak was lost during the 2012 season to Alabama. They finished with a 10\u20138 conference record, giving Purdue its sixth consecutive 22+ win season, the best in the program's history. In the 2012 NBA draft, Robbie Hummel was the 58th overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. The following two seasons brought slim success, missing out on both the NCAA Tournament and the NIT. They accepted a bid in the 2013 CBI, where they lost in the second round to Santa Clara. After a moderate 8\u20135 preseason campaign during the 2015 season, Purdue got back on track, finishing 3rd in the conference after finishing last the season prior. The 2015 season ended after losing to Cincinnati in overtime. It was the first time the program lost its opener in the NCAA Tournament since 1993, breaking a 14-game win streak. After making it back to the NCAA tourney, the program landed its biggest recruit in nearly a quarter century when Fort Wayne native Caleb Swanigan, a top ten recruit, de-committed from Michigan State. They opened the 2016 season with an 11\u20130 record, while setting a program record with consecutive double-digit victories and were ranked as high as 9th in the nation. That season ended with an NCAA First Round loss to Little Rock with a 26\u20139 record. In May 2016, it was announced that the 2017\u201318 Purdue team would represent the U.S. at the 2017 World University Games in Taipei. The team went on to win the silver medal at the Games, winning every game until losing to Lithuania in the gold medal game.\nPurdue won the outright 2017 Big Ten Conference title, along with Caleb Swanigan being named unanimous B1G Player of the Year. In the 2017 NCAA Tournament, Purdue reached the Sweet Sixteen, losing to #1 seed Kansas. In the 2017\u20132018 season, Purdue, led by seniors Vince Edwards, Isaac Haas, PJ Thompson, Dakota Mathias and sophomore Carsen Edwards, spent several weeks at #3 while being on a program record and nation-leading 19-game winning streak. During that time, the Boilers led the nation in scoring margin, points per game, three-point shooting, and was one of only two teams with a top 3 ranking in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Purdue missed out on a consecutive B1G title after losing to Wisconsin, finishing 2nd in the conference at 15\u20133. The Boilers were seeded 4th in the Big Ten tournament, where they beat Rutgers and Penn State to reach the Big Ten tournament Championship for the second time in three years. They faced a familiar opponent in Michigan, whom they had already faced two other times throughout that season, Purdue winning both meetings. However, Michigan beat Purdue 75\u201366 to become Big Ten tournament Champions for the second straight season.\nPurdue was seeded 2nd in the East Region of the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, their highest seed in recent history. In the first round, they faced Cal State Fullerton Titans, winning 74\u201348. However, many Purdue fan's hearts broke in the second half of the game, as senior Center Isaac Haas fell on his elbow as he fought for a rebound, and broke his elbow as he hit the ground, ending his Purdue Basketball career. Purdue's second-round game was against Butler Bulldogs, whom Purdue had already played earlier in the season. The Boilers won the game on a last second shot by Dakota Mathias, winning 76\u201373 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the second straight season. In the Sweet Sixteen, Purdue faced the third seeded Texas Tech Red Raiders. The Boilers went on to lose in disappointing fashion 65\u201378, ending their season with 30 wins.\nIn 2019, Purdue was seeded 3rd in the South Region of the 2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, after another strong season. In the first round, they eliminated a 26\u20138 Old Dominion team that was coming off a Conference USA championship, winning 61\u201348. In the second round, they handily defeated #6 seed Villanova, sending the defending champs home early after an 87\u201361 victory, and advancing to their third straight Sweet Sixteen under Matt Painter. The Boilermakers ran into their first real test with the #2 Tennessee Volunteers. After a back and forth contest that included 17 lead changes and needed overtime to be decided, Purdue came out victorious, barely beating the Vols 99\u201394 to reach their first Elite Eight in nearly 20 years. In the Elite Eight, Purdue faced the #1 seeded Virginia Cavaliers in what was another back and forth thriller.\nAfter several lead changes throughout the game, and a 40-point effort from Carsen Edwards including 10 made 3s, Purdue led 70\u201367 with 5.9 seconds left and looked to be headed to their first Final Four since 1980. Virginia's Ty Jerome was fouled intentionally, and missed the second free throw of two after making the first. Virginia was able to come up with the offensive rebound, and after chasing down the loose ball that had gone into the Virginia back court, toss the ball to Mamadi Diakite who hit a free-throw line floater at the buzzer to send the game to overtime tied 70\u201370. The Boilermakers once again looked to be en route to the Final Four, leading 75\u201374 with 43 seconds to go. However Virginia was able to hold Purdue scoreless over the final minute and prevailed 80\u201375, ending the Boilermakers season with 26 wins and their first Elite Eight appearance since 2000.\nAfter the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Purdue picked up where they had left off in 2019, only this time they were the 4th seed in the South region of the 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Their first-round matchup was against 13th-seeded North Texas, where they came back from behind 32\u201324 at the half to send the game to OT. Ultimately, once there, Purdue couldn't score until the last 30 seconds of overtime, and North Texas pulled off the 78\u201369 upset.\nThe 2022 season saw the Boilermakers reach #1 in the AP Poll for the first time in program history, led by senior Trevion Williams, and All-American sophomore guard Jaden Ivey. In the 2022 tournament, Purdue reached the Sweet Sixteen after a second round win over Texas, only to lose to the Cinderella story of that year's tournament, the 15-seeded Saint Peter's Peacocks.\nThe following year, Purdue put together a 29\u20135 season that again had them reach #1 in the AP poll at various points in the season, and saw them win the Big 10 regular-season championship for a record extending 25th time, and postseason tournament championship for the first time since 2009, leading to a #1 seed in the East Region of the 2023 NCAA Tournament.\nCenter Zach Edey was also voted the third player in Purdue history to win National Player of the Year honors. Purdue would then became the second team in NCAA Tournament history to be upset by a 16-seed, falling 63\u201358 to Fairleigh Dickinson in the First Round, suffering the biggest upset in NCAA tournament history with Purdue being 23+1\u20442-point favorites heading into the game.\nThe 2024 season was more of the same in West Lafayette, with the Boilermakers winning their second consecutive outright Big Ten regular season championship, extending their Big Ten record to 26 titles. Zach Edey was named National Player of the Year unanimously for the second straight season, becoming the first men's college basketball player to win the award in back-to-back years since Ralph Sampson in 1983.\nPurdue was awarded a #1 seed for the second consecutive year in the 2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, this time in the Midwest Region. They cruised into the Sweet Sixteen with routs against 16 seed Grambling State, 78\u201350, and 8 seed Utah State, 106\u201367. With the victory against Utah State, they achieved their 31st win of the season, breaking the program record of most wins in a season. They then defeated 5 seed Gonzaga in Detroit 80\u201368, following a second-half surge, and moved on to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2019.\nThere the Boilermakers met a familiar foe in the tournament on Easter Sunday, the 2 seeded Tennessee Volunteers, led by in many around the nation's opinion the second best player in the country, Dalton Knecht. Zach Edey scored 40 points to go along with 16 rebounds, leading the Boilermakers to a thrilling 72\u201366 victory and a trip to the Final Four in Phoenix, the first under Matt Painter's tenure and the first since 1980.\nThe victory was a monumental day in the history of Purdue Men's basketball, with many in and around the team signifying the win as a watershed moment for the program by getting back to the Final Four after years of underachieving in the NCAA tournament. Former All-American Robbie Hummel was on the sideline for the radio broadcast of the game, and was moved to tears when embracing members of the Purdue coaching staff post game, including his former head coach Matt Painter.\nFollowing the long-awaited trip to the Final Four in Phoenix, the Boilermakers faced off against surprise tournament Cinderella NC State led in part by tournament darling big man D. J. Burns. The Boilermakers controlled the game throughout and pulled away in the second half to win their first Final Four game since 1969 by a score of 63\u201350, advancing to the National Championship game for the first time in 55 years. There Purdue would eventually find the defending national champion UConn Huskies after their victory over Alabama in the later of the 2 Final Four games.\nThe 2024 NCAA Tournament would come down to a match up of two All-American level 7 footers, as UConn came into the championship game led in part by 7 foot 2 Donovan Clingan, leading to the game being billed as a matchup of 2 twin towers at the center position. Purdue kept the game close for most of the first half after entering the game a 6-point underdog, but was unable to rely on their usual three point shooting prowess (Going 1 for 7 from three point range) as UConn's elite perimeter defense made it difficult to convert their usual amount of three point shots. Zach Edey scored 37 points to go along with 10 rebounds in his final game at Purdue, but UConn pulled away in the second half to win their second consecutive national title 75\u201360.\nFollowing the conclusion of the season, Zach Edey would declare for the 2024 NBA Draft, leaving the program as Purdue's all-time leader in points, rebounds, and field goal percentage.\n2024-25 marked the 20th season as head coach for Matt Painter. The Boilermakers finished with a 24\u201112 overall record and a 13\u20117 record in Big Ten play. They tied for fourth in the Big Ten regular\u2010season standings, but tiebreakers dropped them to a 6 seed in the Big Ten Tournament. In the conference tournament, Purdue won its second\u2011round game over USC, then lost in the quarterfinals to Michigan.\nIn the NCAA Tournament, they were awarded an at\u2011large bid as the No. 4 seed in the Midwest region. They won their first two games (over High Point and McNeese State) to reach the Sweet Sixteen, before being eliminated by the Houston Cougars, who would go on to be the national runner\u2011up later in the tournament.\nFollowing the regular season, Braden Smith was named the Big Ten's Men's player of the year, the 6th different Boilermaker to win the award, also marking the 3rd year in a row a player from Purdue had taken home the honor.\n\nBoilermaker home courts\nMackey Arena (formerly Purdue Arena) 1967\u2013present\nLambert Fieldhouse (formerly Purdue Fieldhouse) 1937\u20131967\nLafayette Jefferson High School Gymnasium 1929, 1934\u20131937\nMemorial Gymnasium 1909\u20131934\nLafayette Colliseum\n\nCurrent staff\nResults by season (1980\u2013present)\n*Purdue forfeited 18 regular season wins (6 conference wins) and vacated 1 NCAA Tournament win and 1 NCAA Tournament loss due to use of an ineligible player for during the 1995\u201396 season.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Boilermakers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 36 times.

  "Rutgers Scarlet Knights": {
    "biography": "The Rutgers Scarlet Knights men's basketball team represents Rutgers University in NCAA Division I college basketball competition and competes in the Big Ten Conference. Rutgers made the NCAA Final Four in 1976. Rutgers has appeared in the NCAA tournament eight times, most recently appearing in 2022. Rutgers has produced many NBA players, most notably Roy Hinson, John Battle, and James Bailey. In 2025, Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey made history in the 2025 NBA Draft being selected as the highest Scarlet Knights drafted in the NBA Draft being drafted with the Second and Fifth pick respectively.\n\nHistory\nThe history of Rutgers men's basketball dates back to 1906 when they began their first season of play.  Their first recorded game was a loss to New York University by a score of 38\u201316.  The team was dissolved following the 1907-1908 season, only to be reformed in 1913 where they remained intact uninterrupted until the 1943 season.\nThe team played in the Final Four in the 1976 NCAA tournament and ended the 1976 season ranked fourth in the nation, after a 86\u201370 loss against the Michigan Wolverines in the semifinal round and a 106\u201392 loss to the UCLA Bruins in the tournament's third-place consolation game. This was the last men's Division I tournament to date to feature two unbeaten teams, as both Indiana, who won that year's title, and Rutgers entered the tournament unbeaten. Rutgers went 31\u20130 during the regular season.\nThe Scarlet Knights also played in the championship game of the 2004 NIT Final, losing to the Michigan Wolverines 62\u201355.\nThe Scarlet Knights had a prolonged down period through the following decade, cycling through a number of coaches and routinely finishing at the bottom of the Big East standings. This period included a scandal in 2013 with then head coach Mike Rice Jr. being shown on video verbally and physically abusing players. The scandal resulted in the firing of Coach Rice as well as the resignation of then Rutgers athletic director Tim Pernetti.\nRutgers basketball played their first season in the Big Ten conference in 2014\u20132015. After the hiring of Head Coach Steve Pikiell in 2016, the program began to see renewed success. In the 2019\u201320 season, led by guards Geo Baker and Ron Harper Jr., the Scarlet Knights reached the 20-win mark for the first time since the 2003-04 season, including an 18\u20131 home record and four wins against ranked opponents. That year, they ranked in the top 25 of the AP men's college basketball poll for the first time since 1979. Experts widely predicted Rutgers' inclusion in the 2020 NCAA tournament, but the event was cancelled before the field was announced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The following season, the team would officially break its 30-year tournament drought when it earned a 10-seed in the 2021 NCAA tournament, where it would also achieve its first tournament win since 1983 in a first round win over Clemson. The Scarlet Knights returned to the tournament again the next season, becoming the team with the lowest NET (NCAA Evaluation Tool) ranking at 77th overall to receive an at-large bid since the NCAA has utilized the NET to inform tournament selection choices.\nAfter disappointing back-to-back seasons of missed tournaments, the Scarlet Knights now anticipate the arrival of their 2024 recruiting class, which ranks among the best of all collegiate basketball programs for the year, headlined by two McDonald's All-American players: forward Airious \"Ace\" Bailey and guard Dylan Harper.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Scarlet Knights have appeared in the NCAA tournament eight times.

  "Saint Louis Billikens": {
    "biography": "The Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing Saint Louis University. They compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The head coaching position is currently filled by Josh Schertz. Chaifetz Arena is home to the Billikens. The Billikens have reached the championship game of the NIT tournament four times and have won it once (1948). They have appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament ten times, most recently in 2019.\n\nHistory\nRick Majerus era\nOn April 27, 2007, Rick Majerus accepted the head coaching position. His tenure at SLU got off to a rocky start; in their first conference game, the Billikens set an NCAA Division I record for fewest points scored in a game in the modern era of college basketball, losing 49\u201320 to George Washington.  However, as he had done previously at other programs, Majerus eventually made SLU a winning program.  In 2012, he led the Billikens to their first NCAA Tournament in 12 years, and their first appearance in a major poll in 17 years.\nOn August 24, 2012, Majerus announced he would not coach the 2012\u201313 season due to serious heart problems. Jim Crews, one of his assistants, took over for him on a temporary basis for that season. On November 16, it was announced that Majerus was retiring when it was apparent that his heart condition would not improve enough to allow him to return.\nMajerus compiled a 95\u201369 (.579) record at St. Louis University and retired with an overall NCAA record of 517\u2013215 (.706).\n\nJim Crews era\nJim Crews was promoted to head coach after serving on an interim basis following the health concerns and eventual death of Majerus. He was on Majerus' staff since 2011.  After leading the Billikens to a school-record 28 wins, Crews was formally named SLU's 25th head coach on April 12, 2013. He was fired after the 2016 Atlantic 10 tournament resulted in the elimination of the Billikens and marked the end of two 11\u201321 Billikens seasons. Crews was paid a $1.86 million buyout in 2016-17, according to tax forms.\n\nTravis Ford era\nOn March 30, 2016, Saint Louis University announced that Travis Ford has been hired as the head basketball coach.  He inherited a Billikens team that had gone a disappointing 11\u201321 each of the previous two seasons under Jim Crews. Due to a lack of talent returning from the previous regime, SLU was predicted to finish last in the Atlantic 10 conference during the 2016\u201317 season.  Basketball statistician Ken Pomeroy also predicted the Billikens as the team most likely to go winless during its conference schedule.  Ford led the Billikens to six Atlantic 10 conference wins and a 12\u201321 overall record. The Billikens and Ford gained the attention of national news in January 2024 after it was discovered that Ford's son had created burner Twitter accounts to defend his father, as fans were calling for his firing. Ford and SLU parted ways following the 2023-24 season.\n\nJosh Schertz era\nOn April 6, 2024, it was announced that Josh Schertz had been hired as the head coach for the St. Louis Billikens, replacing Ford.\n\nPostseason appearances\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Billikens have appeared in ten NCAA Tournaments. Their combined record is 6\u201311.\n\nNIT results\nThe Billikens have appeared in 21 National Invitation Tournaments (NIT). Their combined record is 18\u201320. They were NIT champions in 1948 and runner-up in 1961, 1989, and 1990.\n\nCBI results\nThe Billikens have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational (CBI). Their record is 3\u20132 and they were the CBI runner-up in their only appearance.\n\nIndividual honors\nRetired numbers\nHonored jerseys\nJerseys were honored/retired, but numbers remained active and can be chosen by future players\n\nHome courts\n1915, 1917 Muegge's Gymnasium (Grand Ave. and Hickory St.)\n1919\u20131920 Rock Springs Turner Hall (Boyle Ave. and Chouteau Ave.)\n1920\u20131921 College Hall\n1921\u20131922 First Regiment Armory and Macabee's Hall (911 Vandeventer Ave.)\n1922\u20131923 First Regiment Armory and Battery A Armory (1 game)\n1923\u20131924 First Regiment Armory\n1924\u20131925 SLUH Gymnasium\n1925\u20131926 First Regiment Armory, SLUH Gymnasium and St. Louis Coliseum\n1926\u20131945 St. Louis University Gymnasium (West Pine Gym)\n1945\u20131968 Kiel Auditorium\n1968\u20131973 St. Louis Arena\n1973\u20131991 Kiel Auditorium\n1991\u20131994 St. Louis Arena\n1994\u20132008 Scottrade Center (Kiel Center, Savvis Center)\n2008\u2013present Chaifetz Arena\n\nBillikens in the pros\nCareer statistical leaders\nPoints\n1) 1,972 \u2013 Anthony Bonner, 6' 8\" F, 1986\u20131990\n2) 1,910 \u2013 Erwin Claggett, 6' 1\" G, 1991\u20131995\n3) 1,880 \u2013 Roland Gray, 6' 5\" F, 1985\u20131989\n4) 1,877 \u2013 Monroe Douglass, 6' 4\" G, 1985\u20131989\n5) 1,825 \u2013 Gibson Jimerson, 6\u2019 5\u201d G, 2019-present\n6) 1,703 \u2013 Scott Highmark, 6' 5\" F, 1991\u20131995\n7) 1,687 \u2013 Kevin Lisch, 6' 2\" G, 2005\u20132009\n8) 1,575 \u2013 Kwamain Mitchell, 5' 10\" G, 2008\u20132013\n9) 1,547 \u2013 Tommie Liddell III, 6' 4\" G, 2005\u20132009\n10) 1,499 \u2013 Dwayne Evans, 6' 6\" F, 2010\u20132014\n\nRebounds\n1) 1,424 \u2013 Anthony Bonner, 6' 8\" F, 1986\u20131990\n2) 1,157 \u2013 Jerry Koch, 6' 4\" F, 1952\u20131955\n3) 1,128 \u2013 Jim McLaughlin, 6' 4\" F, 1953\u20131956\n4) 998 \u2013 Jordan Goodwin, 6' 3\" G, 2017\u20132021\n5) 982 \u2013 Hasahn French, 6' 7\" F, 2017\u20132021\n\nAssists\n1) 878 \u2013 Yuri Collins, 6' 0\" G, 2019\u20132023\n2) 436 \u2013 Josh Fisher, 6' 2\" G, 2001\u20132004\n3) 424 \u2013 Charles Newberry, 6' 3\" G, 1987\u20131990\n4) 422 \u2013 Jordair Jett, 6' 1\" G, 2010\u20132014\n5) 420 \u2013 Kwamain Mitchell, 5' 10\" G, 2008\u20132013\n\nSteals\n1) 225 \u2013 Jordan Goodwin, 6' 3\" G, 2017\u20132021\n2) 192 \u2013 Anthony Bonner, 6' 8\" F, 1986\u20131990\n3) 179 \u2013 Josh Fisher, 6' 2\" G, 2001\u20132004\n4) 176 \u2013 Yuri Collins, 6' 0\" G, 2019\u20132023\n5) 174 \u2013 Jordair Jett, 6' 1\" G, 2010\u20132014\n\nBlocks\n1) 226 \u2013 Hasahn French, 6' 7\" F, 2017\u20132021\n2) 135 \u2013 Ian Vouyoukas, 6' 11\" C, 2003\u20132007\n3) 127 \u2013 Melvin Robinson, 7' 0\" C, 1989\u20131992\n4) 113 \u2013 Cory Remekun, 6' 9\" F, 2009\u20132013\n4) 113 \u2013 Willie Reed, 6' 11\" F, 2008\u20132010\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nSaint Louis at Sports Reference",

    "biography": "The Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball team represents Saint Mary's College in Moraga, California, competing in the West Coast Conference of the NCAA. The team plays home games in the University Credit Union Pavilion, capacity 3,500; it is one of the smaller gyms in the WCC. Their head coach is Randy Bennett, who is the school's all-time wins leader. The Gaels have appeared in thirteen NCAA Tournaments\u20141959, 1989, 1997, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2017, 2019, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025.\nOn March 1, 2013, they were placed on probation by the NCAA for four years due to rules violations.\nTheir two historic rivals are the San Francisco Dons and the Santa Clara Broncos, two other Catholic schools in the San Francisco Bay Area that are in the WCC. More recently, the Saint Mary's Gaels have developed a rivalry with the Gonzaga University Bulldogs of Spokane, Washington.\n\nHistory\nRecent success\nUnder coach Randy Bennett, the men's basketball team has become recognized nationally as one of the top non-Power 5 programs in the United States. He inherited a 2\u201327 team when he arrived in 2001, and began recruiting an Australian named Adam Caporn. Since then, Bennett has built a reputation of recruiting Australian players; the Gaels have had at least one Australian player in every season since Bennett's arrival. With Caporn in the line-up, and his best friend and fellow Australian Daniel Kickert joining him the following year, Saint Mary's record improved to 9\u201320 in 2001\u201302, 15\u201315 in 2002\u201303, and 19\u201312 in 2003\u201304. In 2004\u201305, the team earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, although they lost in the first round. Their 15\u20131 record in McKeon Pavilion was its best ever.\nAfter rebuilding seasons in 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307, the team enjoyed one of their best seasons in school history in 2007\u201308, behind the play of Australian freshman Patty Mills. The team was ranked in the AP and USA Today top 25 lists for five and six weeks, respectively. They ended up receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament in 2008 as well, but again lost in the first round. In 2008, the team got off to a strong start, going 14\u20132 before Mills broke his hand and missed a month. Mills came back in time for the West Coast Conference tournament, but after a loss to Gonzaga in the WCC tournament finals, the team was not selected for the NCAA tournament and played in the NIT. After the end of the year, Mills declared for the NBA draft and was a second-round selection.\nIn March 2010, the Gaels received an automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA tournament, after winning the championship game of the WCC Tournament. Having beaten Gonzaga in the tournament final, it was the Gaels' second WCC tournament victory since it began in 1987. In 2010, they won their first NCAA Tournament game since 1959, defeating the Richmond Spiders. On March 20, 2010, the Gaels, led by Omar Samhan, defeated second seeded Villanova to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, for their first time in the 64 team era. They then lost to 3 seed Baylor 72\u201349 to end their season 28\u20136 and with its worst loss of the year.\nFollowing the loss of Samhan to graduation, many expected the Gaels next season to be a rebuilding year. Led by point guard Mickey McConnell, however, Saint Mary's compiled a 25\u20139 record, 11\u20133 in the WCC, including the Gaels' first win against Gonzaga in Spokane since 1995. But after absorbing a late-season loss to last-place San Diego and dropping an ESPN BracketBuster game at home against Utah State, Saint Mary's failed to make the NCAA tournament. They would be upset in the first round of the NIT by Kent State. After McConnell graduated, Australian point guard Matthew Dellavedova became the team's new star alongside San Diego transfer and San Francisco native Rob Jones. The Gaels compiled a 27\u20136 record and went 14\u20132 in the WCC in 2011\u201312, including a win in Moraga over Gonzaga and a sweep of new conference member BYU. Saint Mary's spent most of the season ranked in the AP and Coaches' polls and won the outright WCC regular season title, the first time since 2000 that Gonzaga had not claimed part of the title. The Gaels then defeated Gonzaga in overtime in the WCC tournament, marking the first time in school history Saint Mary's won both the regular season and tournament titles. Saint Mary's lost to Purdue in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nSaint Mary's Australian pipeline, historically focused on the Australian Institute of Sport (from where Caporn and Mills were recruited), continues to the present. The 2011\u201312 team featured four AIS graduates, including 2012 WCC Player of the Year Dellavedova, and another Australian, Jorden Page. The 2015\u201316 team had four AIS graduates, boasting a total of six Australians, and the 2016\u201317 roster had a program record of seven Australians. In the latter season, the Gaels went so far as to hold an official celebration of Australia Day for their home game against San Francisco, which fell on the holiday's date of January 26. Before the game, Australia's national anthem was played alongside the US anthem, and the school honored officials from Australia's San Francisco consulate.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Gaels have made 13 NCAA tournament appearances. They have an overall 8\u201314 record in tournament games.\n\nNIT results\nThe Gaels have appeared in six National Invitation Tournaments. Their combined record is 7\u20137.\n\nVenues\nSaint Mary's basketball and volleyball teams play their home games at the University Credit Union Pavilion, which has a capacity of 3,500. It was originally named after George R. McKeon, a former member of the college's Board of Regents. Constructed in 1978, it underwent renovations in the summer of 2006, with new features including painted bleachers,  new chair backseats behind the reserved section, a remodeled VIP section, and a banner with \"GaelForce\" on it behind the student section. In 2019, the venue was renamed to University Credit Union Pavilion.\n\nRivalries\nGonzaga\nMain article: Gonzaga\u2013Saint Mary's men's basketball rivalry\n\nSt. Mary's biggest rivalry is with fellow West Coast Conference foe Gonzaga. Many analysts and members of the media have touted the Gaels vs. Zags as one of the best, if not the best, college basketball rivalry on the West Coast, as both teams have been consistently the two top teams in the conference over the last 2 decades. Saint Mary's and Gonzaga have combined to win 24 out of the last 26 conference championship games (Gonzaga 20, Saint Mary's 4, San Diego 2). Currently Gonzaga leads the series 81\u201335.\n\nNotable players\nRetired numbers\nNotable in other fields\nMahershala Ali, guard 1992\u20131996, two-time Academy Award winning actor, listed as Hershal Gilmore while at Saint Mary's\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "biography": "The Saint Peter's Peacocks men's basketball team is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball program that represents Saint Peter's University in Jersey City, New Jersey. The school's team competes in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) and plays their home games in Run Baby Run Arena. They are currently led by third-year head coach Bashir Mason, who was hired on April 12, 2022. The Peacocks have appeared in the NCAA tournament five times, including a historic run to the Elite Eight as a 15-seed in 2022 where they finished the season ranked No. 24 in the nation by the USA Today Coaches Poll with the best NCAA post-season run and the most wins by a MAAC program in a single NCAA Tournament.\nIn 2004 and 2005, Keydren Clark led the nation in points scored per game, becoming just the eighth player to repeat as NCAA Division I scoring champion. In 2006, Clark became only the seventh NCAA player to score more than 3,000 points in a career. He finished his career as the sixth all-time NCAA leading scorer, the record holder for the most three-point shots made in NCAA history with 435 and was named MAAC Player of the Year. Clark led the MAAC in scoring in all four seasons (2002\u20132006) at Saint Peter's and is the all-time leading scorer in university history with 3,058 points.\n\nHistory\nSaint Peter's University is one of the founding members of the  Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), which began play in men's basketball with the 1981\u201382 season. Since then, the Peacocks have compiled the second most wins of any MAAC team and have won the MAAC Championship five times (1991, 1995, 2011, 2022, 2024), tied for the second most all-time. Saint Peter's previously competed in the Metropolitan Collegiate Conference (MCC) from 1965 to 1969. Basketball has long been the most popular sport at the university.\nSaint Peter's first season of basketball was 1930\u201331 which was the also the same year the college re-opened on a new campus following its twelve-year closure from the impacts of World War I. To celebrate the school's rebirth, the dean named the Peacock as its official mascot. Collins Memorial Gymnasium was the first campus building and where the Peacocks played most of their home games into the 1950s and continued to practice until its demolition.\nThe Peacocks recorded their first consecutive winning seasons under head coach George Babich in 1947\u201348 (16\u20135) and 1948\u201349 (18\u20135).\nIn the 1950s, Saint Peter's found sustained success with the hiring of head coach Don Kennedy ahead of the 1950\u201351 season as the fifth head coach in program history. The Peacocks would make back-to-back NAIA Tournament appearances in 1953 and 1954. Saint Peter's would make a run to the NAIA Quarterfinals in 1954 where they would lose to Arkansas Tech 77\u201381. They would then go on to make back-to-back appearances in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1957 and 1958.\nThe Peacocks first gained national recognition on March 18, 1968, with a stunning upset. Led by head coach Don Kennedy, Saint Peter's defeated the nationally ranked No. 10 Duke Blue Devils 100\u201371 in the 1968 NIT Quarterfinals in front of a sold-out crowd of 19,500 at Madison Square Garden. This was the first sell-out for a college basketball game at the current Madison Square Garden. The Peacocks advanced to the sold-out semifinal game against the Kansas Jayhawks led by future Hall of Famer Jo Jo White. Demand to attend the game was so high that Saint Peter's arranged for the game to be shown on a CCTV feed in the Stanley Theater at Journal Square to a capacity crowd. The Peacocks NIT run ended in a 46\u201358 defeat and a fourth-place finish. This was the second of three consecutive NIT appearances for Saint Peter's. During the 1967\u201368 season, the Peacocks went 24\u20134, 8\u20130 in conference play and averaged 94 points per game. The team was later nicknamed the \"Run, Baby Run\" Team after that phrase was found written on a blackboard by Peacocks reserve center Tom Schwester inside the door to the Peacock locker room after their win over Duke.\nIn 1972, Don Kennedy ended his twenty-two year career as the winningest head coach in program history with a 323\u2013195 (.624) record from 1950 to 1972. Under Kennedy, the Peacocks became known for their fast-pace offensive tactics even with the addition of the shot clock in 1954. During his tenure, the Peacocks registered a winning season in 19 of 22 seasons, three 20-win seasons, including the program's first 20-win campaign in 1957\u201358, a program-record 24 victories in 1967\u201368 and appearances in five NIT Tournaments and two NAIA Tournaments.\nOn November 29, 1975, the Victor R. Yanitelli, S.J. Recreational Life Center (Yanitelli Center) opened on campus on the former site of Collins Gymnasium as the new home court of the Peacocks with an inaugural game against the Dartmouth Big Green. Prior to its opening, Saint Peter's hosted its home games at the nearby Jersey City Armory and still occasionally use the venue for high-profile games.\nFrom 1975 to 1989, the Peacocks made seven appearances in the NIT (1975, 1976, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1987, 1989). Saint Peter's would make its deepest run during that span in the 1980 NIT. Led by head coach Bob Dukiet, the Peacocks defeated the UConn Huskies (71\u201356) and the Duqesnse Dukes (34\u201333) en route to a tough Quarterfinal matchup against the Sidney Green led UNLV Runnin' Rebels where they would lose 63\u201367.\nDuring this period, prior to joining the MAAC in 1981, the Peacocks participated in the ECAC men's basketball tournaments (regional end-of-season tournaments played by Division I schools that were independent, with Saint Peter's being in the Metro region) in 1975, 1976, 1980, 1981. The Peacocks defeated the Fordham Rams 65\u201347 in the semifinals to make it to the 1980 ECAC Metro Championship game where they were defeated by their future MAAC rival, the Iona Gaels, 64\u201346.\nIn the early 1990s, Saint Peter's began to find success in the MAAC Tournament under head coach Ted Fiore. In 1991, the Peacocks won their first MAAC Championship over the Iona Gaels 64\u201358 to send them to their first ever NCAA Tournament. The No. 5 Texas Longhorns would defeat them 65\u201373 in the First Round of the Midwest Region. In 1995, the Peacocks were again MAAC Champions after upsetting the No. 1 Manhattan Jaspers 80\u201378 in overtime. They would be matched up against the Marcus Camby led No. 2 Umass Minutemen in the NCAA Tournament where the Minutemen would be victorious over the Peacocks 68\u201351 in the First Round of the East Region.\nOn June 17, 2002, Saint Peter's was one of sixteen schools selected to participate in the NIT Season Tip-Off Tournament. On November 18, 2002, the Peacocks played fellow Jesuit university program the Xavier Musketeers with the Peacocks falling in the opening round 48\u201387.\nFrom 2002 to 2006, the Peacocks were led by starting point guard Keydren \"Kee-Kee' Clark who was one of the most prolific scorers in NCAA Division I history. During his college career at Saint Peter's, Clark amassed 3,058 points and averaged 29.5 points a game. In 2003, he was named MAAC Rookie of the Year. In 2004 and 2005, he led the nation in points scored per game, becoming just the eighth player to repeat as NCAA Division I scoring champion. On March 4, 2006, Clark became only the seventh NCAA player to score more than 3,000 points in his career; on the next day, he passed Hersey Hawkins to become the sixth-leading scorer of all time. The milestone happened in a game where the Peacocks upset the No. 1 Manhattan Jaspers 84\u201374 in the MAAC Tournament semi-finals. He was later named 2006 MAAC Player of the Year. Clark finished his college career as the sixth all-time NCAA leading scorer and as the NCAA record holder for the most three-pointers made with 435. He was later passed by JJ Redick who finished his college career with 457. Clark led the MAAC in scoring in all four seasons at Saint Peter's and is the all-time leading scorer in Saint Peter's University and New Jersey collegiate history with 3,058 points. He also holds the Yanitelli Center scoring record for most points in a game with 44. Clark returned to the Peacocks ahead of the 2022\u201323 season and is currently Director of Player Development and an assistant coach.\nOn December 27 and 28, 2005, Saint Peter's played in the Panasonic Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden. They took on the UMass Minutemen in the opening round where the Minutemen defeated the Peacocks 66\u201349. They were then matched up against the Columbia Lions where the Peacocks won 63\u201354 to finish third in the regular season tournament.\nOn November 17, 2009, Saint Peter's garnered national exposure by hosting the Monmouth Hawks as part of the second annual ESPN's 24\u2013Hour College Hoops Tip-Off Marathon. The marathon of live games across ESPN's networks marked the first day of the college basketball season. Ahead of the game, the university hosted an 11-hour \"all-nighter\" of campus activities with free breakfast and a pre-game pep rally. The game tipped-off at 6:05 a.m. and ended with the Peacocks defeating the Hawks, 58\u201334 in front of 1,246 students, alumni and fans.\nIn 2011, the Peacocks won their third MAAC Championship over the No. 2 Iona Gaels 62\u201357 which sent them to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. This was their first trip to the NCAA Tournament since 1995 and third trip overall. Saint Peter's drew the No. 3 Purdue Boilermakers in the First round. Purdue would go on to defeat Saint Peter's 65\u201343 in the Southwest Region.\nIn 2017, led by head coach John Dunne, the Peacocks went 23\u201313 and 14\u20136 in conference to play to finish second in the MAAC. In the MAAC Tournament, they defeated the Canisus Golden Griffens in the quarterfinals 61\u201358 before losing to the lona Gaels in the semifinals 65\u201373. They were invited to play in the 2017 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) where they won their first-ever national postseason title by defeating the Texas A&M\u2013Corpus Christi Islanders 62\u201361 becoming just the second MAAC program to win a national postseason championship. Saint Peter's hosted and defeated the Furman Paladins in the semifinals of the CIT 77\u201351 at the Yanitelli Center marking the first time Saint Peter's ever hosted a national post-season tournament.\nOn July 22, 2020, Saint Peter's announced that through a $5 million lead gift from alum and former basketball player Thomas P. Mac Mahon, they would begin a phased renovation of the Yanitelli Center. The renovation included the creation of a more modern basketball/volleyball arena with new retractable bleachers with an allotment of chairback seating, a full replacement of the hardwood court surface, updated branding and signage, a reimagined entryway to the facility, enhanced lighting and new video scoreboards. Mac Mahon, a 1968 graduate of Saint Peter's, and a member of the Saint Peter's University Board of Trustees, decided to honor his former 1967\u201368 teammates by naming the renovated space the \"Run Baby Run Arena\" after that team's nickname for its high-scoring offense. The new arena debuted on November 1, 2021, with Saint Peter's defeating fellow Jersey City school New Jersey City University 90\u201366 in an exhibition game.\nIn 2022, the Peacocks won their fourth MAAC Championship defeating the Monmouth Hawks 60\u201354 and earning a spot in the 2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where they would again earn national recognition. Led by head coach Shaheen Holloway, Saint Peter's became the tenth No. 15 seed in history to upset a No. 2 seed after knocking off the Kentucky Wildcats 85\u201379 in overtime. They then defeated the Murray State Racers in the next round 70\u201360, becoming the third No. 15 seed in tournament history (and the third in the last nine years) to make the Sweet 16. In the Sweet 16, they upset the No. 3 seed Purdue Boilermakers 67\u201364, to become the first No. 15 seed in tournament history to advance to the Elite Eight. Their historic Cinderella run came to an end with a 49\u201369 loss against eventual national runner-up No. 8 North Carolina. The Peacocks concluded their historic 2021\u201322 season with an overall record of 22\u201312 and the best NCAA post-season run with the most wins in a single NCAA Tournament by any MAAC program (men or women) in the conference's 41-year history. Following the tournament, Jersey City held a parade for the team along John F. Kennedy Boulevard to celebrate the Peacocks' historic run. On April 5, 2022, Saint Peter's was ranked No. 24 nationally in the season's final USA Today Coaches Poll.\nOn November 15, 2023, the Peacocks took on the FDU Knights in a regionally and nationally televised game on the YES Network dubbed the \"Battle of the Bracket Busters\" & \"Battle for the Hackensack\" at the Knights home court, the Bogota Savings Bank Center. Both New Jersey programs were recent NCAA Tournament bracket busters with Saint Peter's being the first No. 15 seed to make a run to the Elite Eight in 2022 and FDU becoming the second No. 16 seed and first First Four team to beat a No. 1 seed when they defeated the Purdue Boilermakers, 63\u201358 in 2023. The Knights made two free throws with 1.7 seconds left to defeat the Peacocks 71\u201370.\nIn 2024, the Peacocks returned to the NCAA tournament after they defeated the No. 2 Fairfield Stags in the MAAC Championship, 68\u201363 for their fifth conference title. Saint Peter's would not be able to replicate their 2021\u201322 Cinderella run season and lost in the First Round to the No. 2 Tennessee Volunteers 49\u201383 in the Midwest Region.\nOn November 26, 2024, the Peacocks played in a \"Battle of the Bracket Busters\" & \"Battle for the Hackensack\" rematch against the FDU Knights at Bogota Savings Bank Center that was also televised on the YES Network. Saint Peter's avenged their 1-point loss the year before with a buzzer beater layup to defeat Fairleigh Dickinson 78\u201376.\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Peacocks have appeared in the NCAA Tournament five times.

Hurley has credited the \"speed and precision\" of Kennedy's fast break offense as ahead of its time and  the template for the principals he employed as the head coach of the St. Anthony High School Friars in Jersey City.

    "biography": "The Samford Bulldogs men's basketball team is the basketball team that represents Samford University in Homewood, Alabama, United States. The school's team currently competes in the Southern Conference. They are currently led by head coach Lennie Acuff and play their home games at the Pete Hanna Center. The Bulldogs have appeared three times in the NCAA tournament, most recently in 2024.\n\nHistory\nSamford University has sponsored a men's basketball team since 1901. They have been NCAA Division I since 1972 as an independent, in the Trans-Atlantic Athletic Conference (now ASUN Conference), the Ohio Valley Conference, and presently the Southern Conference.\n\nJohn Brady Era (1991\u20131997)\nJohn Brady was the head men's basketball coach at Samford from the 1991\u201392 season through the 1996\u201397 season. While coaching at Samford, he led the program to back-to-back Trans America Athletic Conference West Division titles in 1996 and 1997. His record during his years at Samford was 89\u201377. He left Samford to become the head coach at LSU in 1997. He stayed with the Tigers until 2008, leading the program to SEC regular-season titles in 2000 and 2006, earning SEC Coach of the Year honors both years. He coached LSU to four NCAA Tournament appearances, reaching the Sweet 16 in 2000 and the Final Four in 2006. Following his years at LSU, Brady was the head coach at Arkansas State from 2008\u201316, winning a pair of Sun Belt West Division titles. He retired from coaching with a career record of 402\u2013344.\n\nJimmy Tillette Era (1997\u20132012)\nJimmy Tillette was the head men\u2019s basketball coach at Samford from 1997 to 2012.

In his years in charge of the Samford program, Tillette won a school-record 229 games. His 1998\u201399 team won a school-record 24 games, going 24\u20136, winning the TAAC regular season and TAAC Tournament titles and earning the program\u2019s first NCAA Tournament bid. For his efforts, Tillette was named the 1999 TAAC Coach of the Year. The following season, the team went 21\u201311, winning the TAAC Tournament and reaching the NCAA Tournament for a second-straight year. The 1999\u20132000 team also claimed impressive wins over Alabama and St. John\u2019s. Tillette\u2019s 2005\u201306 team posted a record of 20\u201311, reaching the finals of the Ohio Valley Conference Tournament.\n\nBennie Seltzer Era (2012\u20132014)\nBennie Seltzer was the head men's basketball coach at Samford from 2012 to 2014.

  "San Diego State Aztecs": {
    "biography": "For information on all San Diego State University sports, see San Diego State Aztecs\n\nThe San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball team is the men's college basketball program that represents San Diego State University (SDSU). The Aztecs compete in NCAA Division I as a member of the Mountain West Conference (MW). The team plays its home games at Viejas Arena.\nThe Aztecs have been to seventeen NCAA Division I tournaments since joining NCAA Division I in 1969, last appearing in the tournament in 2025. In the 2023 NCAA tournament, they reached the Final Four for the first time in program history, losing to UConn in the championship game. The Aztecs have won seven Mountain West Conference tournaments and nine regular season titles.\nNotable alumni include 2-time NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Tony Gwynn, who played both basketball and baseball for the Aztecs. Gwynn was drafted by both the San Diego Padres and the then-San Diego Clippers on the same day, June 9, 1981 (1981 Major League Baseball draft and 1981 NBA draft, respectively).\n\nTeam history\nThe Aztecs first began play during the 1921\u201322 basketball season. The team played that season, as well as the next three, as part of the Southern California Junior College Conference due to proximity to other schools, despite the fact that SDSU (then known as San Diego Normal School) was not a junior college itself. The Aztecs joined the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) in 1926 following a season as an independent, and competed in the NAIA until 1956, when they transitioned to the newly founded NCAA Division II. They competed in six NAIA Men's Basketball Championships. Finishing as runners up in 1939 and in 1940, the Aztecs finally prevailed and won the 1941 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament. After competing in NCAA Division II from 1956 until 1969 they became an NCAA Division I school in the fall of 1969. The Aztecs moved from the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA), which is now known as the Big West Conference, to the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 1978. In 1999, the Aztecs left the WAC and became a charter member of the Mountain West Conference. Prior to entering the Mountain West, the team had been to three NCAA Division I men's basketball tournaments. During their time in the MWC, the Aztecs have won several conference championships and have been to nine NCAA tournaments and four NIT tournaments.  In the 2010\u201311 season, the Aztecs were ranked as high as 4th in the nation and won their first ever games in the NCAA tournament, reaching the Sweet Sixteen. Following the 2013\u201314 season, the team reached its second Sweet Sixteen. In the 2019\u201320 season, the Aztecs finished with a 30\u20132 record for their best winning percentage in team history. The team spent seven straight weeks in the top 5 of both the AP Top 25 and Coaches Poll, finishing the season at #6 in both polls. The 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was cancelled at the end of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2022\u20132023 season, the Aztecs reached their third Sweet Sixteen, first Elite Eight with a win over #1 Alabama, and first Final Four. The win over Creighton on March 26 in the South Region Final gave them their first Region championship in program history.  On April 1, they became the first team from the Mountain West Conference to reach the National Championship after defeating FAU 72\u201371 on a buzzer-beating shot by point guard Lamont Butler. In the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game, the Aztecs were defeated by the University of Connecticut Huskies by a score of 59\u201376.\n\nRivalries\nThe Aztecs have three rivalries, the UNLV Rebels, the USD Toreros, and the BYU Cougars. The rivalry with the Rebels was especially fierce between the years 2010\u20132013, however the rivalry has cooled down significantly due to the one-sided nature of the affair. San Diego State has won 22 of 24 games against UNLV from 2014 to 2024. The USD Toreros are the Aztecs' crosstown rivals and play them near-annually in the City Championship. The Aztecs' rivalry with the BYU Cougars has been partially dormant since 2011, when the Cougars left the MWC for the WCC. The teams still play occasionally in non-conference games.\n\nFacilities\nViejas Arena\nViejas Arena (officially Viejas Arena at Aztec Bowl) is a multi-purpose arena located in San Diego, California on the campus of San Diego State University. The arena opened in 1997 and seats 12,414 for basketball and up to 12,845 for concerts.\nViejas Arena is the home of the San Diego State Aztecs men's and women's basketball teams. The arena also hosts the San Diego Mojo of the Pro Volleyball Federation. The arena features an \"open-air\" concourse design that allows fans to experience breaks, concessions, and event activities for games, concerts, and other events outdoors.\nPrior to the opening of the arena, men's basketball played its home games primarily at Peterson Gymnasium (located across the street from Viejas Arena and the current home to the Aztec women's volleyball team), and, for more than 30 years, played on-and-off at the San Diego Sports Arena.\n\nJeff Jacobs JAM Center\nIn 2015, the San Diego State Athletics Department opened an on-campus state-of-the-art practice facility, The Jeff Jacobs JAM Center, for the Aztec men's basketball and women's basketball teams.\n\nHead coaches\nAs of the 2024 Media Guide\n\nPostseason\nNCAA Division I tournament results\nThe Aztecs have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament 17 times, with a combined record of 13\u201317. They have reached the Sweet Sixteen four times, in 2011, 2014, 2023, and 2024; in 2023 they reached the Elite Eight, the Final Four, and the National Championship, all for the first time. Additionally, at 30\u20132 and ranked in the Top 10 they were considered a virtual lock for the 2020 NCAA Tournament, which was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNCAA Tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1978 edition with the present seeding format beginning the following year.\n\nNIT results\nThe Aztecs have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) six times, with a combined record of 8\u20136.\n\nNCAA Division II tournament results\nThe Aztecs appeared in the NCAA Division II tournament three times, with a combined record of 5\u20133.\n\nNAIA tournament results\nThe Aztecs have appeared in the NAIA tournament five times. Their combined record is 15\u20134. They were NAIA national champions in 1941.\n\nRetired jerseys\nOn January 16, 2020, the Aztecs announced that they would be retiring former small forward Kawhi Leonard's number 15 jersey on February 1, 2020. Following Leonard's jersey retirement, some confusion circulated regarding statements that Leonard was the first player in Aztecs history to have his jersey retired, as the school ceremoniously retired former power forward and center Michael Cage's number 44 jersey in 1984.\nOn December 29, 2023, the Aztecs announced that they would be retiring three more jerseys in a \"Return to the Rafters\" ceremony on January 17, 2024. The players honored were Milton \"Milky\" Phelps, Judy Porter, and Michael Cage. This ceremony resolved the prior confusion regarding Cage's jersey retirement.\n\nTeam records\nAll-time record vs. current MWC teams\nOfficial record (including any NCAA imposed vacates and forfeits) against all current MWC opponents as of the completion of the 2022\u20132023 season:\n\nThrough March 14th, 2023.\n\nCareer leaders (DI era)\nAs of the 2022-23 Media Guide [1]\n\nSingle season leaders (DI era)\n(*) Lead conference\n\nSingle game leaders (DI era)\nAll stats are from the [2] and are updated through the 2022\u20132023 basketball season.\n\nNotable former players\nSeveral former Aztec men's basketball players have gone on to play in the NBA, play in other professional basketball leagues, or achieve significant notability outside of basketball.\n\nNBA draft selections\nThere have been 25 former San Diego State players selected in the NBA draft:\n\nMalachi Flynn - 2020, Round 1, Pick 29, Toronto Raptors\nXavier Thames - 2014, Round 2, Pick 59, Toronto Raptors\nJamaal Franklin - 2013, Round 2, Pick 41, Memphis Grizzlies\nKawhi Leonard - 2011, Round 1, Pick 15, Indiana Pacers\nRandy Holcomb \u2013 2002, Round 2, Pick 57, San Antonio Spurs\nAnthony Watson \u2013 1986, Round 4, Pick 87, Denver Nuggets\nSteffond Johnson \u2013 1986, Round 5, Pick 100, Los Angeles Clippers\nLeonard Allen \u2013 1985, Round 3, Pick 50, Dallas Mavericks\nMichael Cage \u2013 1984, Round 1, Pick 14, Los Angeles Clippers\nKeith Smith \u2013 1983, Round 10, Pick 209, San Diego Clippers\nTony Gwynn - 1981, Round 10, Pick 207, San Diego Clippers\nKim Goetz - 1979, Round 8, Pick 158, New York Knicks\nMike Dodd \u2013 1976, Round 9, Pick 176, San Diego Clippers\nJoel Kramer - 1978, Round 3, Pick 63, Phoenix Suns\nSteve Malovic - 1978, Round 6, Pick 130, Phoenix Suns\nSteve Copp \u2013 1976, Round 3, Pick 42, Golden State Warriors\nBob Kovach \u2013 1976, Round 9, Pick 142, Atlanta Hawks\nKen Smith \u2013 1976, Round 10, Pick 173, Golden State Warriors\nChris McMurray \u2013 1973, Round 12, Pick 178, Cleveland Cavaliers\nJimmy Wilkins \u2013 1972, Round 11, Pick 157, Portland Trail Blazers\nGary Schneider \u2013 1971, Round 19, Pick 236, San Diego Rockets\nBernie Finlay \u2013 1960, Round 9, Pick 67, Syracuse Nationals\nBob Brady \u2013 1954, Round 7, Pick 54, Philadelphia Warriors\nDick Barnes \u2013 1950, Round 5, Pick 52, New York Knicks\n\nSee also\nSan Diego Hall of Champions\nBreitbard Hall of Fame\nSan Diego sports curse\nBasketball in the United States\nCollege basketball\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

  "San Francisco Dons": {
    "biography": "The San Francisco Dons men's basketball team represents the University of San Francisco in NCAA Division I men's college basketball.  The Dons compete in the West Coast Conference, where they have won sixteen regular season championships and one conference tournament championship. The current head coach is Chris Gerlufsen. They play home games at the War Memorial Gymnasium, which also serves as the venue for women's basketball, volleyball, athletic department offices, and athletic training rooms. Some games may be played at Chase Center.\nThe basketball team claims three national titles: the 1949 NIT under Pete Newell, and the 1955 and 1956 NCAA Division I championships. The latter two were under Phil Woolpert, and led by player and National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Famer Bill Russell.\nUSF retained its status as a basketball powerhouse into the 1970s and early 1980s, holding the distinction of being a \"major\" program in a \"mid-major\" conference (the WCC having declined somewhat in stature since the 1960s). It held the number one spot in the polls on numerous occasions. In 1977, led by All-American center Bill Cartwright, the Dons started 29\u20130 and were regarded as the #1 team in the nation in both major polls before dropping their last two games.\nThe San Francisco Dons men's basketball program has been rated the 29th \"Greatest College Basketball Program of All-Time\" by Street & Smith's magazine, 49th by NBC Sports \"Greatest Programs of All-Time\", and 75th by the ESPN/Sagarin All-Time College Basketball Rankings, higher in all three rankings than any other West Coast Conference school and many schools from BCS Conferences (Pac-12, Big Ten, Big 12, Big East, Southeastern Conference).\n\nHistory\nBasketball got its start at USF, then known as St. Ignatius College, in 1910. The original coach was Orno Taylor, whose subsequent achievements were lost to history. The scores had grown since 1895 but the writing was as florid as ever. The College Annual reported that \"the entire team did nobly in the season just finished and the student body as a unit thanks them for their loyalty and devotion.\" The results weren't bad either. The St. Ignatius team won six of its seven games, losing only to Pacific (then located in San Jose) by a mere three points. Included in the victories was a sweep of Santa Clara, still a major rival, by scores of 38\u201331 and 22\u201313.\n\nPete Newell era\nAfter serving in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1946, Pete Newell was appointed men's basketball head coach at the University of San Francisco in 1946. During his four-year tenure at USF, Newell compiled a 70\u201337 record and coached the Dons to the 1949 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship, beating Loyola (Chicago) 48-47. (At the time, the NIT was more prestigious than the NCAA Tournament.) This was the team of All-American Don Lofgran, Joe McNamee, captain John Benington, Ross Giudice, Frank Kuzara and a baby-faced guard named Rene Herrerias. New York's Madison Square Garden crowds were notoriously tough to please. Lofgran, Herrerias and company had them cheering in the aisles. In 1950, he accepted an appointment as head coach at Michigan State University, where he stayed until 1954. He later led the University of California to the 1959 NCAA men's basketball championship, and a year later coached the gold medal-winning U.S. team at the 1960 Summer Olympics. After his coaching career ended he ran an instructional basketball camp and served as a consultant and scout for several National Basketball Association (NBA) teams.\n\nPhil Woolpert and the Russell era\nNewell left for Michigan State in 1950, and USF hired Phil Woolpert as his successor. He assumed both the posts of men's basketball coach and athletic director.\nDuring his tenure at USF, Woolpert posted a 153\u201378 record, including a 60-game win streak that at the time was the longest in college basketball (surpassed later by John Wooden's 88 straight wins at UCLA.). His teams, anchored by Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Eugene Brown and Mike Farmer, were known for their defense and held opponents below 60 points on 47 different occasions. USF won the National Championship in 1955 and 1956, and finished third in 1957. Woolpert also won Coach of the Year honors in 1955 and 1956.\n\nBill Russell was ignored by major college scouts, largely because he didn't even start at McClymonds High School in Oakland. He did not receive a single letter of interest until Hal DeJulio from USF watched him in a high school game. DeJulio was not impressed by Russell's meager scoring and \"atrocious fundamentals\", but sensed that the young center had an extraordinary instinct for the game, especially in clutch situations. When DeJulio offered Russell a scholarship, the latter eagerly accepted. Sports journalist John Taylor described it as a watershed in Russell's life because Russell realized that basketball was his one chance to escape poverty and racism.\n\nAt USF, Russell became the new starting center. Woolpert emphasized defense and deliberate half-court play, concepts that favored defensive standout Russell. Woolpert was unaffected by issues of skin color. In 1954, he became the first coach of a major college basketball squad to start three African American players: Russell, K.C. Jones and Hal Perry. In his USF years, Russell used his relative lack of bulk to develop a unique style of defense: instead of purely guarding the opposing center, he used his quickness and speed to play help defense against opposing forwards and aggressively challenge their shots. Combining the stature and shot-blocking skills of a center with the foot speed of a guard, Russell became the centerpiece of a USF team that soon became a force in college basketball. After USF kept Holy Cross star Tom Heinsohn scoreless in an entire half, Sports Illustrated wrote, \"If [Russell] ever learns to hit the basket, they're going to have to rewrite the rules.\"\nNonetheless, these games were often difficult for the USF squad. Russell and his African American teammates became targets of racist jeers, particularly on the road. In one notable incident, hotels in Oklahoma City refused to admit Russell and his black teammates while they were in town for the 1954 All-College Tournament. In protest, the whole team decided to camp out in a closed college dorm, which was later called an important bonding experience for the group. Decades later, Russell explained that his experiences hardened him against abuse of all kinds. \"I never permitted myself to be a victim,\" he said.\nOn the hardwood, his experiences were far more pleasant. Russell led USF to NCAA championships in 1955 and 1956, including a string of 55 consecutive victories. He became known for his strong defense and shot-blocking skills, once denying 13 shots in a game. UCLA coach John Wooden called Russell \"the greatest defensive man I've ever seen\". While at USF, together with K. C. Jones, he also helped pioneer a play that later became known as the alley-oop. During his college career, Russell averaged 20.7 points per game and 20.3 rebounds per game.\nBesides basketball, Russell represented USF in track and field events. He competed in the 440 yards (400 m) race, which he could complete in 49.6 seconds. He also participated in the high jump; Track & Field News ranked him as the seventh-best high jumper in the world in 1956. That year, Russell won high jump titles at the Central California AAU meet, the Pacific AAU meet, and the West Coast Relays. One of his highest jumps occurred at the West Coast Relays, where he achieved a mark of 6 feet 9+1\u20444 inches (2.064 m).\nAfter his years at USF, the Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to join their exhibition basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged by the fact that owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.\nWoolpert stayed at USF for nine years.  During his tenure, he was known for building national powers almost exclusively on Bay Area talent; the athletic department had virtually no recruiting budget and had little to offer out-of-state players.\n\n1960s and 1970s dominance\nThe Dons remained as a powerhouse for several years after their 1950s run. The team added four more Elite Eight appearances to its resume: 1964, 1965, 1973, and 1974.\nUSF retained its status as a basketball powerhouse into the 1970s and early 1980s under Bob Gaillard and Dan Belluomini, holding the distinction of being a \"major\" program in a \"mid-major\" conference (the WCC's stature declined somewhat in the 1960s). Although John Wooden and his UCLA Bruins had eclipsed San Francisco as the premier West Coast power, the Dons remained an elite program well into the early 1980s. It held the number one spot in the polls on numerous occasions and  six consecutive conference titles from 1977\u201382, and all but two WCC regular-season titles from 1972 to 1982. In 1977, led by All-American center Bill Cartwright, the Dons started the season 26\u20130 and were regarded as the #1 team in the nation in both major polls. Sports Illustrated highlighted the 1977 team with a cover story titled \"The Dandy Dons.\" Until they lost to Notre Dame.\n\nNCAA violations and self-imposed death penalty\nThe Dons remained an elite program well into the early 1980s, perennially ranked in the top 20, and captured six consecutive conference titles from 1977\u201382. San Francisco's success on the court came at a price, however. The NCAA placed the Dons on probation two times in the late 1970s for booster/alumni interference with the program and recruiting improprieties by coaches. Each NCAA investigation eventually led to the dismissal of a San Francisco head coach, leading San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Glenn Dickey to call the program \"totally out of control.\" As a response to these incidents, school president Rev. John Lo Schiavo, S.J. a lifelong basketball enthusiast and all-city power forward in his youth, gave an ultimatum after the second NCAA case was resolved in 1980: if there was any further incident, the program would be shut down.\nDespite Lo Schiavo's warning, the improprieties continued. An exclusive invite-only booster organization called the Dons Century Club committed hundreds of thousands of dollars to illegally recruiting players, paying off family members, and covering travel expenses, while other alumni were also giving or \"lending\" players large sums of money, paying them for no-show jobs, providing lavish gifts, as well as picking up pricey restaurant and entertainment tabs. Basketball players continued to receive special academic treatment; many were marginal students at best, and at least one incident occurred in which a player threatened another student, and the incident was swept under the rug by school officials.  It was also commonplace for \"tutors\" to take tests and write papers for players. The situation finally came to a head in December 1981, when All-American guard Quintin Dailey was found guilty of raping a female student. During the subsequent investigation, Dailey admitted taking a no-show job for $1,000 a month at a business owned by a prominent USF booster, and that another booster also paid Dailey $5,000 since 1980.\nTrue to his word, on July 29, 1982, Lo Schiavo announced that he was shutting down the basketball program\u2014the first time a Division I university had voluntarily shut down a major sport under such circumstances. Lo Schiavo said that the Dons program \"was once a source of inspiration, respect and pride for this university and city.\"  By contrast, the recent scandals had resulted in USF being perceived as \"being hypocritical or na\u00efve or inept or duplicitous, or perhaps some combination of all those.\"  Under the circumstances, Lo Schiavo felt that the only responsible course was to shutter the program. In a prepared statement, Lo Schiavo later said, \"We hope that it one day may be possible to restore a men's intercollegiate basketball team. That possibility will depend upon whether those responsible for this university are convinced that the factors that destroyed the program are not going to beset it again.\"\nHis decision made international headlines, to the degree that while visiting San Francisco, Queen Elizabeth II pulled Lo Schiavo aside to ask when he would reinstate the basketball program. Drastic as it was, the move was widely applauded by several members of the coaching fraternity.\nSan Francisco reinstated men's basketball in 1985, but without the overzealous Dons Century Club. The successor to the Dons Century Club is the Green and Gold Club, a group of boosters under the direct control of the athletic department.\n\nReinstatement of Dons basketball\nLo Schiavo resurrected the program in 1985 with former star Jim Brovelli as head coach, who quickly returned the program to respectability. He was not able to reach the postseason, however, and resigned in 1995. Three years later USF went to the 1998 NCAA tournament under Phil Mathews and they had a 2005 NIT berth under former coach Jessie Evans.\nThe program regressed the next few years, and Jessie Evans was granted a request for a 'leave of absence' on December 27, 2007. Basketball coach Eddie Sutton took over on an interim basis, needing two wins for a personal milestone of 800 career coaching victories. At the time, Bob Knight was the only other Division I men's coach to have accomplished the feat. After months of speculation, Evans was finally officially fired by USF on March 20, 2008. \nRex Walters was named as the Dons' head coach on April 14, 2008. In 2010, the USF Dons won over 20 games and went to the quarterfinals of the postseason CIT tournament. Walters was relieved of his duties on March 9, 2016, and replaced by Kyle Smith.\nAt the conclusion of the 2018\u20132019 season, Kyle Smith was hired by Washington State University after three consecutive 20-win seasons. \nSmith's Associate Head Coach Todd Golden was promoted to Head Men's Basketball Coach on March 27, 2019. Under Golden, the 2021-22 Dons returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 24 years. Golden departed after the season to coach Florida and was replaced by Chris Gerlufsen.\nThe Dons have never approached the prominence they enjoyed from the 1940s to the 1980s. The program has never won an NCAA Tournament game since its revival; indeed, the Dons last survived the tournament's opening weekend in 1979. This was largely because Lo Schiavo significantly increased admissions standards for all student-athletes in the wake of the scandals of the 1970s and 1980s, pricing the Dons out of blue-chip recruifs. In a 2011 interview, Lo Schiavo reiterated that he never questioned his decision, noting that all but one trustee voted in favor of shuttering the program in 1982 \"because we had to make the point that we mean what we say and we intended to be good citizens.\"\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Dons have appeared in 17 NCAA Tournaments.

  "Seton Hall Pirates": {
    "biography": "The Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball program is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball program of Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey. The team competes in the Big East Conference and plays their home games in the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The Pirates are currently coached by Shaheen Holloway. Seton Hall has appeared 14 times in the NCAA tournament and were national runners-up in 1989.\n\nHistory\nSeton Hall's first season of basketball occurred in 1903\u201304, but the school did not field a team again until 1908\u201309, the year in which the university achieved its first winning season. The school adopted the Pirate mascot in 1931, and the teams soon gained national prominence with the arrival of John \"Honey\" Russell in 1936. During an 18-year span, the Pirates racked up a 295\u2013129 record that included an undefeated 19\u20130 record in 1939\u201340 as part of a 41-game unbeaten streak.  Walsh Gymnasium was opened in 1941 to house the basketball team permanently and featured one of the best Seton Hall teams of all time, termed the \"Wonder Five\", which led by All-American Bob Davies, earned the school's first NIT bid in 1941. Following World War II, the Pirates were led by stars Frank Saul and Bobby Wanzer and regularly played games at Madison Square Garden. The peak of this era occurred in 1953 when Richie Regan and Walter Dukes defeated rival St. John's University for the NIT title. Perhaps the low point for the team occurred in 1961 when a point shaving scandal sullied the program, but the Pirates rebounded to return to the NIT in 1974 under coach Bill Raftery. Seton Hall became a charter member of the Big East Conference in 1979, where they are still a member to this day.\n\nAlthough Seton Hall did have a lengthy American Football Team, The high point of the Big East era for Seton Hall came when P. J. Carlesimo was hired in 1982 and the team began playing in the Meadowlands Arena. By 1988, Carlesimo led the Pirates to the school's first NCAA tournament appearance, and in 1989, he led the Hall to an unexpected tournament run to the NCAA Championship game, where they were defeated by Michigan in overtime. Success under Carlesimo continued with a Big East tournament championship and an Elite Eight appearance in 1991, a regular season Big East Championship and Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1992, and Big East Regular Season and Big East tournament Championships in 1993. Carlesimo left to coach in the NBA following the 1993\u201394 season, but Seton Hall returned to the Sweet Sixteen in 2000 guided by coach Tommy Amaker, and appeared in the NCAA tournament in 2004 and 2006 coached by Louis Orr. In 2006\u201307, Bobby Gonzalez was hired to lead the Pirates, which moved its home games into the Prudential Center in 2007. Gonzalez amassed a 66\u201359 record at Seton Hall but was fired at the conclusion of the 2009\u201310 after a first-round NIT loss to Texas Tech. Concerns were raised in-house about the direction Gonzalez was taking the program, punctuated by several incidents, some involving Gonzalez and others involving student athletes. Shortly after his dismissal Gonzalez was arrested for shoplifting. Seton Hall then hired Kevin Willard for the 2010\u201311 season.\n\nAfter struggling to maintain a .500 record through his first five seasons with the program, Willard's Pirates finally broke through in the 2015\u201316 season, as they won the Big East tournament Championship over the eventual national champion Villanova Wildcats. With the win, Seton Hall secured the school's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2006 and the first Big East tournament Championship since 1993. However, the magic could not continue in the NCAA tournament, as the team was defeated by the 11th-seeded Gonzaga Bulldogs in the First Round. In 2017, the Pirates were again eliminated in the First Round of the NCAA tournament by the Arkansas Razorbacks, but the Pirates would win their first tournament game in fourteen years upon defeating the NC State Wolfpack in 2018's first round before being defeated by the Kansas Jayhawks in the Second Round. Following the graduation of starting seniors Khadeen Carrington, \u00c1ngel Delgado, Desi Rodriguez, and Ismael Sanogo, the Pirates would appear in their fourth consecutive NCAA tournament for the second time in program history in 2019. Led by the play of standout junior guard Myles Powell, the Pirates, at risk of missing the tournament sitting on a 16\u201312 overall and 7\u20139 Big East record, won their final two regular season games at home against 16th-ranked Marquette and 23rd-ranked Villanova and advanced to the Big East Final where they lost a rematch to Villanova by two points. Ultimately, they secured a #10 seed in the tournament following their performance down the stretch, and fell to the Wofford Terriers in a first round game in which Fletcher Magee would break Division I's all-time three-point scoring record. In November 2021, Seton Hall traveled to Ann Arbor, Michigan to play the then #4 ranked Michigan Wolverines as part of the Big East-Big 10 Gavitt Games. Of note was that the game was the first time the two programs had met since the 1989 NCAA National Championship Game when Michigan beat Seton Hall by one on a controversial foul call. In the 2021 version, Seton Hall upset Michigan, making it the first time Seton Hall had won a road game against a non-conference AP top-five team in university history.

  "South Carolina Gamecocks": {
    "biography": "The South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball team represents the University of South Carolina and competes in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Gamecocks won Southern Conference titles in 1927, 1933, 1934, and 1945, and then they gained national attention under hall of fame coach Frank McGuire, posting a 205\u201365 record from 1967 to 1976, which included the 1970 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship, the 1971 ACC Tournament title, and four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances from 1971 to 1974.  The program also won the 1997 SEC championship, National Invitation Tournament (NIT) titles in 2005 and 2006, and co-champions of the 2009 SEC East division title.  Most recently, the Gamecocks won the 2017 NCAA East Regional Championship, reaching the Final Four for the first time in school history. Lamont Paris is the current head coach, and the team plays at the 18,000-seat Colonial Life Arena.\n\nHistory\nSouthern Conference years\nSouth Carolina achieved a measure of regional prominence during its tenure in the Southern Conference, winning regular season championships in 1927, 1933, 1934, and 1945.  The program also won the conference's tournament championship in 1933.  During World War II, the basketball team's success was partially attributed to being assigned outstanding athletes by the U.S. Navy as part of the V-12 program.  However, the Navy leaders kept the teams focus towards the war effort, and USC declined an invitation to the Southern Conference Tournament in 1944.\n\nFrank McGuire era (1965\u20131980)\nThe hiring of Frank McGuire before the 1964\u201365 season propelled South Carolina to its most successful period to date.  McGuire's 16-year tenure was highlighted by an undefeated ACC regular season in 1970, an ACC Tournament championship in 1971, and three consecutive Sweet 16 appearances from 1971 to 1973.  USC also posted a 69\u201316 overall record from 1968 to 1971, and John Roche won consecutive ACC Player of the Year Awards (1969\u20131970).  In November 1968, the Gamecocks began playing at the 12,401 seat Carolina Coliseum, which became known as the \"House that Frank Built.\"  The success South Carolina achieved on the court brought resentment and anger from fellow ACC schools, especially those on \"Tobacco Road,\" as the conference members of the state of North Carolina were known.  The hostility of the road crowds, the unfriendly behavior of coaches and athletic directors in the conference, and the discrepancies in eligibility to compete in the NCAA tournament, which at that time was delegated strictly to the winner of the ACC tournament despite that year's championship game being the only Gamecocks loss, led McGuire to support South Carolina becoming an Independent before the 1971\u201372 season.\nAs an independent, the program gradually declined, and the university sought entrance into an athletic conference.  This proved problematic because most conferences required schools to have a single athletic director, and South Carolina had multiple directors at the time.  McGuire served as athletic director for the basketball program, and he would not relinquish his position.  The university made several attempts to obtain McGuire's resignation, but ultimately honored his contract through 1980.  McGuire finished with a 283\u2013142 overall record at South Carolina and continues to be held in high regard by Gamecock fans.  His six consecutive 20-win seasons from 1969 to 1974, which produced a 137\u201333 record, remain the benchmark for USC Basketball.\n\nMetro Conference and SEC\nIn 1983, the university became affiliated with the Metro Conference.  The basketball program was placed on probation by the NCAA in the spring of 1987 for two years because of recruiting violations and the sale of complimentary player tickets.  From 1987 to 1991, George Felton led the Gamecocks to an 87\u201362 overall record, which included a 1989 NCAA Tournament appearance and a 1991 NIT berth.  For three of Felton's five seasons (1987\u20131989), Tubby Smith served as an assistant coach before leaving to join Rick Pitino's staff at Kentucky.  South Carolina joined the SEC before the 1992 season and initially struggled, posting a combined 20\u201335 record in 1992 and 1993.\n\nEddie Fogler era (1994\u20132001)\nEddie Fogler was hired away from Vanderbilt before the 1994 season and within a few years returned the Gamecocks to respectability.  Under Fogler, South Carolina posted an impressive 66\u201328 record (34\u201314 SEC) during the 1996\u20131998 stretch, which included the school's first SEC championship in 1997.  The 1997 Gamecocks posted a 15\u20131 record in SEC play and defeated league rival Kentucky twice, but lost in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament.  Fogler stepped down after the 2001 campaign, going 123\u2013117 in eight seasons as the Gamecocks' head coach.  His tenure included two NCAA Tournament appearances (1997, 1998) and two NIT appearances (1996, 2001).  Fogler retired as one of the most successful head coaches in SEC Basketball history, having won regular season conference championships at both Vanderbilt and South Carolina.\n\nDave Odom era (2002\u20132008)\nSubsequent coach Dave Odom posted four 20-win seasons during his tenure at South Carolina.  He led the Gamecocks to an appearance in the 2004 NCAA Tournament and consecutive NIT championships in 2005 and 2006. Odom's tenure also saw USC begin play at the 18,000 seat Colonial Life Arena during the 2002\u20132003 season.  Following the 2007\u20132008 campaign, Odom resigned with a 128\u2013104 overall record at USC.\n\nDarrin Horn era (2009\u20132012)\nOn April 1, 2008, Darrin Horn was named the new head basketball coach at USC.  In his first season, Horn led the Gamecocks to a 21\u201310 record (10\u20136 SEC), two victories over Kentucky, and a share of the 2009 SEC Eastern Division title.  After a 10\u201321 campaign in 2011\u201312, his third straight losing season, Horn was fired on March 13, 2012, finishing his tenure at Carolina with a 60\u201363 overall record and a 23\u201345 mark in the SEC.\n\nFrank Martin era (2012\u20132022)\nFrank Martin came to USC from Kansas State, where he had enjoyed five winning seasons and four NCAA Tournament appearances, including an Elite Eight appearance with the Wildcats in 2010. After losing records in his first two seasons with the Gamecocks, he achieved a winning season in 2015, then reached the NIT in 2016, and then broke through into the 2017 NCAA Tournament, the program's first appearance in the event since 2004. On March 17, 2017, USC achieved its first NCAA Tournament victory since 1973 with a 20-point win over the Marquette Golden Eagles. Two nights later, the Gamecocks upset the #2 seed Duke Blue Devils to advance to their fourth Sweet 16. South Carolina then beat #3 seed Baylor Bears to advance to their first-ever Elite 8, two days later they upset Florida to advance to their first ever Final Four.\n\nLamont Paris era (2022\u2013present)\nFormer Chattanooga head coach Lamont Paris was named South Carolina's 33rd head coach on March 24, 2022, to replace the terminated Frank Martin.

  "St. Bonaventure Bonnies": {
    "biography": "The St. Bonaventure Bonnies men's basketball (formerly the St. Bonaventure Brown Indians) team is the college basketball team that represents St. Bonaventure University, located near the city of Olean, New York. The school's team currently competes in the Atlantic 10 Conference and plays its home games at the Reilly Center. The Bonnies are currently coached by all-time coaching wins leader Mark Schmidt, who during his 12th season surpassed former coach Larry Weise with his 203rd victory.\n\nHistory\nBeginnings\nOf the major sports at St. Bonaventure, basketball was the last introduced. In 1902, the first team had been put together, mainly consisting of former football players. The coach of this team was university professor Patric Driscoll. Official records of these games were not kept. Proper facilities were not available until four years later when intramural games began to be played in a handball court on campus.\nIn 1916, Butler Gym was constructed, but wasn't finished by the time the intercollegiate team played its first game against University at Buffalo. This game was played in the Olean Armory. Games were cancelled until after World War I had ended. The first game played in Butler Gym was during the 1919-1920 season with Richard Phelan as the coach. Basketball prospered on campus in the decades between World War I and World War II. From 1942 to 1944, basketball was again put on hold for a world war. Following World War II, Anslem Kreiger, a former All-American Basketball player, took over the program, with a record of 15-10 over his two-year tenure. The Brown Indians returned to the Olean Armory after the war and remained there for the next 20 seasons. The team was noted for having won 99 consecutive home games at the Armory before that streak was broken in February 1961.\nEd (Melvin) Milkovich took over the basketball team for a six-year period starting with the 1948\u201349 season, after Kreiger was promoted to athletic director. This was a period of great success for the program, with two appearances in the National Invitational Tournament (NIT), the first during the 1950\u201351 season when the team was eliminated in the second round. Further success came with the team's appearance in the 1952 NIT, where they made it to the semifinals. Over his tenure, Milkovich led the team to a record of 98\u201347.\nEdward Donovan took over head coaching duties for the 1953\u201354 season, holding the position for an eight-year period. The team again made an appearance in the NIT in 1957, again making it to the semifinals\n\nGolden era\nUnder Donovan, the team made it to the NIT every year from 1957 to 1960. In 1961, the team made its first trip to the NCAA tournament and finished third in its regional. However, this was Donovan's final season coaching the Brown Indians; in May 1961 he took a job as a coach of the New York Knicks.\n\nFormer Brown Indian Larry Weise took over the team starting with the 1961\u201362 season. In 1964, Weise led the team to the NCIT Tournament and the NIT. Under Weise's tutelage, the team returned to the NCAA tournament in 1968, proceeding to the second round prior to being eliminated. In 1970, St. Bonaventure, led by future NBA-great Bob Lanier, was thought to have a legitimate shot at unseating UCLA for the national title. However, they lost Lanier late in their East regional final victory over Villanova to a torn ligament, causing the All-American to miss the Final Four. St. Bonaventure was upset by Jacksonville in the national semifinals, before losing to New Mexico State in the national consolation game. In each Final Four game, the Lanier-less Bonnies were dominated by the opponent's pivot, Artis Gilmore for Jacksonville and Sam Lacey for New Mexico State. \nWeise led the team to another trip to the NIT in 1971. In 1973, he relinquished his post as coach. He was replaced by Jim Satalin, another former Brown Indian. He led the team to a championship in the NIT in 1977. The next year, the team again made it to the NCAA tournament and was defeated in the first round. In 1979, St. Bonaventure joined the Eastern Athletic Association (informally known as the \"Eastern 8,\" and renamed the Atlantic 10 Conference in 1982) and the Brown Indians made another appearance at the NIT and again were defeated in the first round. The team was renamed the Bonnies in 1992.\n\nRebounding\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, the Bonnies finished in second place in A-10 play under coach Jim Baron and lost to #6 ranked Temple in the A-10 tournament championship. The Bonnies received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, their first bid since 1978. However, they failed to advance, losing to #19 ranked Kentucky in double overtime in the first round. Following the season Baron moved on to coach fellow A-10 school, Rhode Island.\n\n2003 scandal\nJan van Breda Kolff was hired to continue the rebuilding Baron had achieved. However, he, instead, did the opposite. The 2002\u201303 men's basketball season was marred by a scandal after a transfer student from a junior college, Jamil Terrell, was permitted to play even though he had not completed his associate degree and was therefore ineligible for one year. The team was forced to forfeit every game in which he played and was barred from the A-10 Tournament. In protest, players voted to sit out the last two games of the regular season. Head coach Jan van Breda Kolff, athletic director Gothard Lane, and school president Dr. Robert Wickenheiser were all ousted. St. Bonaventure's chairman of the board of trustees, William Swan, took his own life in August 2003, feeling that he had let down his alma mater by failing to prevent the scandal.\nSt. Bonaventure docked itself three scholarships from 2003 to 2005 and the NCAA subsequently put the team on three years' probation and banned it from postseason play in 2003\u201304. Subsequently, the Bonnies failed to achieve a winning record until the 2010\u201311 season under coach Mark Schmidt.\n\nRenewed success\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, the team enjoyed more success than in any season since the 2003 scandal. Led by conference Player of the Year Andrew Nicholson \u2014 the 19th pick by Orlando in the 2012 NBA draft \u2014 they accumulated a 20\u201312 record during the regular season. They then won the school's first-ever Atlantic 10 tournament title, beating Saint Joseph's, UMass, and Xavier. The conference title earned them an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, where they lost 66\u201363 to ACC champion Florida State in the second round at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.\nAfter Nicholson departed for the NBA, the 2012\u201313 team failed to qualify for the 2013 A-10 tournament in Brooklyn. However, the 2013\u201314 Bonnies qualified for the A-10 tournament, advancing to the semifinals. They upset the #1 seed Saint Louis on a buzzer-beater shot by Jordan Gathers, the nephew of Hank Gathers. That play made the SportsCenter Top 10 plays of the Night. In the 2014\u201315 campaign, the Bonnies had a winning record and advanced to the quarterfinals of the A-10 Conference tournament. On February 7, 2015, Bonnies guard Marcus Posley hit a buzzer beater shot to upset the nationally ranked VCU Rams and Shaka Smart at the nearly sold-out Reilly Center. The students, and many fans, rushed the court to celebrate after Posley's shot went in.\nThe 2015\u201316 Bonnies finished in a three-way tie for first place in the A-10 regular season. The Bonnies were upset in their first game of the A-10 tournament, losing in overtime to Davidson. The Bonnies failed to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament and were considered one of the \"first four out\" by the selection committee, their poor non-conference strength of schedule and lack of non-conference quality wins being listed as the reasons they were not selected for a bid. Their omission was widely considered to be one of the largest snubs of the year, if not all time, being the first team to ever to have an RPI ranking in the top 30 and a conference regular season title to their name, and not receive a bid. It came as such a surprise to so many in the college basketball world, that it prompted the Atlantic 10 athletic director to issue a public statement voicing her dissatisfaction with the committee's decision to exclude the Bonnies.  The following year, St. Bonaventure alum Brian Toolan wrote a short book about the Bonnies' 2015-2016 season, entitled \"Snubbed\".\nThe 2017-18 Bonnies tied the school's season record at 25 wins, a record previously set by the 1969-1970 Final Four team. The 25-win season resulted in an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament as an 11-seed, where the Bonnies went on to beat the UCLA Bruins 65-58 for their first NCAA tournament win since 1970. The 2017-2018 season marked the Bonnies' seventh NCAA tournament appearance in program history and the second under head coach Mark Schmidt. The Bonnies later lost to the Florida Gators 62-77 in the 1st round of the NCAA tournament.\nOn February 27, 2021 the Bonnies clinched the first ever outright Atlantic 10 regular season title in program history when Davidson defeated VCU 65-57.  The successful season continued two weeks later when, on March 14, 2021, the Bonnies won their first A-10 tournament title since 2012, beating VCU 74-65.  With this win the Bonnies secured an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, their second in 4 years.\nThe 2021\u201322 Bonnies opened the new campaign ranked in the AP Poll for the first time in a half century. Following a win in the Charleston Classic (in which the Bonnies defeated Boise State, Clemson and Marquette) the Bonnies reached as high as 16th in the national poll. The Bonnies went unranked the rest of the season following a loss to Northern Iowa in their first game after the Charleston Classic win. Following an ankle injury to their star Point Guard Kyle Lofton, the Bonnies fell to AP ranked UCONN and were blown out against Virginia Tech in Lofton's return to play. Following that loss to VA Tech. the Bonnies went on a one-month COVID pause due to positive cases within their program and their opponents. The A-10 preseason favorite Bonnies finished the regular season as the 4th seed for the A-10 tournament, losing to 5th seeded Saint Louis in the quarterfinals after Lofton missed 2 free throws trailing by 1 point with under 2 seconds remaining.\nThe Bonnies returned to National Invitational Tournament (NIT) after missing out on an NCAA tournament berth. They defeated Colorado, Oklahoma and Virginia en route to an appearance at Madison Square Garden for the NIT semifinals versus Xavier. The Bonnies fell in that game to finish their season. Following the loss, the \"ironman 5 2.0\" as they were called composed of Kyle Lofton, Dominick Welch, Jaren Holmes, Jalen Adaway and Osun Osunniyi all opted to take their talents elsewhere. Adaway entered the NBA draft, Lofton transferred to Florida, Holmes and Osunniyi transferred to Iowa State, and Welch transferred to Alabama.\nOn September 18, 2024, former ESPN journalist Adrian Wojnarowski, a 1991 graduate of the school, was announced as the program's general manager.\n\nSeasons\nPostseason\nNCAA Division I tournament results\nThe Bonnies have appeared in eight NCAA Tournaments.

In 2024, the school reportedly declined an NIT invitation, one of 17 schools, and the only mid-major to do so that year. It reversed that decision for 2025 and accepted their invitation to that tournament.\n\nNational polls\nSt. Bonaventure has finished in the Final Top 25 rankings 6 times in the AP Poll.\n\n\u2020 The Associated Press began compiling a ranking of the top 20 college men's basketball teams during the 1948\u20131949 season. It has issued the poll continuously since the 1950\u20131951 season. Beginning with the 1989-1990 season, the poll expanded to 25 teams.\n\nNotable players and coaches\nCoaches with NCAA Tournament appearances\n\u2020 - As of March 25, 2022\n\nAll-Americans\nSt. Bonaventure has had 11 All-Americans in its history.\n\nRetired numbers\nBasketball Hall of Fame inductees\nBonnies in the NBA\nSt. Bonaventure has had 17 former players who have gone on to play in the NBA.\n\nBonnies in the Olympics\nSBU wins vs. the AP Top 25\nSince the 1993\u201394 season, SBU has played a total of 48 games against teams ranked in the AP Top 25 Poll.

The Bonnies also hold a record of 9\u20139 against ranked teams at the Reilly Center since 1993.\n\nBroadcasting\nFM 95.7 in Olean signed on in 1949 and carried the St. Bonaventure men's basketball team from its sign-on through the next 74 seasons. In July 2023, the university announced that it was unable to come to an agreement with the station's current owners to continue broadcasting the games. For the 2023\u201324 season, the Bonnies broadcast their home games exclusively online. The university retained Gary Nease, their play-by-play broadcaster since 1995, to helm the play-by-play broadcast. Chris Russell, former station manager at FM 105.9 in Little Valley (where he formerly broadcast the women's basketball team), served as producer of the broadcasts. Nease explained that \"I was getting it from both my company and Bonaventure that they weren't happy with some of the things that were going on (...) Bonaventure was doing a good job recruiting corporate sponsors. I think our station and Bonaventure were competing directly against each other for the advertising dollars that we needed to cover our costs and turn a profit.\"\nAfter one season of carrying the games exclusively online, in which the broadcasts drew fewer than 1,500 listeners per game, St. Bonaventure signed an agreement with WBRR (FM 100.1) in Bradford, Pennsylvania to carry the team's men's basketball broadcasts beginning in fall 2024, with all staff carrying over. The university also signed an agreement with YES Network to televise five games, with streaming rights to those games held by the \"Gotham Sports App\" joint venture between YES and MSG Networks. In 2025, the university added WKSN in Jamestown as an affiliate.\n\nRoc City Hoops Classic\nFormerly known as the Lightower Conference Classic, the Roc City Hoops Classic is an annual collegiate men's basketball event.

  "St. John's Red Storm": {
    "biography": "The St. John's Red Storm men's basketball team represents St. John's University, located in Queens, New York. The team participates in the Big East Conference, of which it is a founding member. As of the end of the 2023\u201324 season, St. John's ranked ninth all-time among NCAA Division I teams with 1,942 total wins. St. John's has appeared in 31 NCAA tournaments, most recently qualifying as Big East tournament champion in 2025. St. John's best finish in the NCAA tournament came in 1952, when the team, then known as the Redmen, made their first trip to the Final Four and were NCAA runners-up. St. John's made its second and most recent Final Four appearance in 1985. St. John's is coached by Rick Pitino.\nSt. John's boasts two Wooden Award winners as national player of the year, 11 consensus All-Americans, six members of the College Basketball Hall of Fame, and has sent 59 players to the NBA. However, St. John's currently holds the NCAA Division I record for most NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship appearances without a championship. The Red Storm play most of their home games at Madison Square Garden, \"The World's Most Famous Arena\", while their early non-conference games are held at Carnesecca Arena on the St. John's campus in Queens. St. John's University holds the second best winning percentage for a New York City school in the NCAA basketball tournament (second to City College of New York, which won the 1950 NCAA Division I Championship). St. John's has the most NIT appearances with 27, the most championship wins with 6, although they were stripped of one due to an NCAA infraction. The 1910\u201311 St. John's team finished the season with a 14\u20130 record and was retroactively named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. In 2008, St. John's celebrated its 100th year of college basketball.\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1907\u20131927)\nThe St. John's men's basketball team played its first game on December 6, 1907, losing to New York University and registering its first win in program history against Adelphi University on January 3, 1908. Just three years later, the 1910\u201311 team were undefeated in a 14\u20130 season coached by former track and field Olympian Claude Allen, for which the team was later honored by the Helms Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll as national champions.\n\nBuck Freeman era (1927\u20131936)\nThe Wonder Five\nTwenty years later, former St. John's player Buck Freeman was hired as coach. In his first four years, from 1927 to 1931, the team had a 85\u20138 record. The 1929\u201330 and 1930\u201331 teams were known as the \"Wonder Five\", made up of Matty Begovich, Mac Kinsbrunner, Max Posnack, Allie Schuckman, and Jack \"Rip\" Gerson, who together helped revolutionize the game of basketball and made St. John's the marquee team in New York City. On January 19, 1931, the Wonder Five team was a part of the first college basketball triple-header at Madison Square Garden in a charity game which saw St. John's beat CCNY by a score 17\u20139. Freeman finished his coaching career with a record of 177\u201331, an .850 winning percentage.\n\nFirst Joe Lapchick era (1936\u20131947)\nJoe Lapchick, a former player of the Original Celtics, took over as head coach at St. John's in 1936 and continued the success the school had become used to under Buck Freeman. Lapchick coached from 1936 to 1947 and again from 1956 to 1965. His Redmen teams won four NIT championships (1943, 1944, 1959, 1965). Lapchick preferred to take his teams to the more prestigious NIT instead of the NCAA tournament, making the NIT semifinals 8 out of a total 12 times, and only one NCAA tournament appearance in his 20 years of coaching the Redmen. Under Lapchick's coaching his teams also won six Metropolitan New York Conference regular season titles.\n\nBack-to-back NIT Champions\nOn its way to its first of back-to-back NIT titles, St. John's had a record of 21\u20133 with only two losses occurring during the regular season. One was a 40\u201346 home loss to rival Niagara and another was a 38\u201342 loss at Madison Square Garden to Manhattan. The 1942\u201343 St. John's team were led by senior caption Andrew \"Fuzzy\" Levane and sophomore All-American center Harry Boykoff. The Redmen's trademark defense and inside scoring presence of Boykoff led them past Rice, Fordham, and Toledo to claim the first of six NIT titles. The season did not end after the NIT; three days later St. John's participated in the first Red Cross charity benefit game against NCAA champion Wyoming to determine a national champion. Wyoming won, 52\u201347.\nSt. John's became the first team to repeat as champions in the seven-year history of the NIT even though World War II and the players' commitment to serve in the armed forces made it a very difficult season. Harry Boykoff missed the 1943\u201344 and 1944\u201345 seasons due to being drafted for the war effort, along with the team's star point guard Dick McGuire for half the 1943\u201344 season and the entire following two years. Despite the losses of their star players, the St. John's team managed to finish the season with an 18\u20135 record and a second NIT crown by defeating Adolph Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats and Ray Meyer's DePaul Blue Demons. The Redmen were led by playmaking junior guards Hy Gotkin and Bill Kotsores, the latter of whom was selected as the 1944 NIT Most Valuable Player. For the second year in a row the Redmen participated in the Red Cross benefit game where they faced the NCAA champion Utah, and lost 36\u201344. The 1951 1952 team lost to Kentucky 81\u201340 in December 1951. In the NCAA tournament, St John's beat Kentucky, 64\u201357. They later finished second in the tournament to Kansas.\nSt. John's success continued the following year where they produced another 21\u20133 record, but their chance at a rematch with George Mikan's DePaul squad and a third consecutive NIT title was shattered with an upset loss to Bowling Green in the semifinals. They beat Rhode Island State for a third-place finish. Lapchick's Redmen made the NIT both of the next two years and added two more Metropolitan New York Conference regular season titles before heleft to take the head coaching job of the New York Knickerbockers in just the second year of their existence in the new Basketball Association of America, becoming the highest paid coach of the league at the time.\n\nFrank McGuire era (1947\u20131952)\nLapchick was succeeded by Frank McGuire, a former player under Buck Freeman, who made the postseason four out of five years as the coach and had an overall record of 102\u201336, culminating in a second-place finish in the 1952 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Under McGuire, the Redmen reached an overall number one ranking in The Associated Press poll twice, won three Metropolitan New York Conference regular season titles, competed in four NITs and made their first appearance in the NCAA tournament where they made it to the Elite Eight before falling to eventual national champion Kentucky. They defeated North Carolina State for a regional third-place finish that year.\nAt the end of the season, McGuire left St. John's to become the basketball coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. On paper, this was a significant step down from St. John's, as UNC was not reckoned as a national power at the time. However, school officials wanted a big-name coach to counter the rise of rival North Carolina State under Everett Case. McGuire's assistant coach, Al \"Dusty\" DeStefano, took over the head coaching duties of St. John's from 1952 to 1956. DeStefano's teams only made one postseason appearance and it was a 58\u201346 loss to the Seton Hall Pirates in the NIT Finals who were led by All-American center Walter Dukes. The following year, the Redmen had their first losing season in over 30 years.\n\nSecond Joe Lapchick era (1956\u20131965)\nOne month after leaving his position with the New York Knicks, Lapchick resumed his head coaching duties where he started and put St. John's back on its winning path. Picking up where he left off, he added two more NIT championships, made the postseason 6 out of 9 times, and finished with an overall college coaching record of 334\u2013130. In 20 years of coaching in the college ranks, Lapchick only had one losing season.\n\n1959 & 1965 NIT Champions\nSt. John's finished the 1958\u201359 season with an overall 20\u20136 record and captured its first ECAC Holiday Festival title with a 90\u201379 victory over St. Joseph's in the final and the school's third NIT championship by defeating top-seeded Bradley 76\u201370 in double overtime. The starting five for the Redmen consisted of four seniors and sophomore sensation Tony Jackson who was named both the Holiday Festival and NIT Most Valuable Player during the 1958\u201359 season, setting a school record of 27 rebounds in one game. At the end of the season senior captain Alan Seiden was rewarded with second team All-American honors and the Haggerty Award, given to the best collegiate player in the New York metropolitan area. Throughout the next three years, St. John's went 58\u201318, led by Jackson who received All-American honors all three years at school, 6'11\" center and future NBA champion LeRoy Ellis, and future ABA/NBA coach Kevin Loughery. In the 1961\u201362 season, St. John's made their fifth NIT finals appearance before falling to Dayton 73\u201367.\n\nLapchick went into the 1964\u201365 season knowing it would be his last year coaching at St. John's because he reached age 65, the mandatory retirement age of the university. His team began the year off by upsetting Cazzie Russell's Michigan Wolverines, the No. 1 team in the nation according to both the Associated Press and United Press International polls, by a score of 75\u201374 to capture the school's second ECAC Holiday Festival title. St. John's finished the season 21\u20138 and went on a remarkable run in the 1965 NIT by defeating Boston College, New Mexico, Army, and top-seeded Villanova to win Lapchick his fourth NIT championship. The Redmen were led by the rebounding of sophomore forward Lloyd \"Sonny\" Dove and the scoring of senior Ken McIntyre who totaled 101 points in his last four games, over 1,000 points for his college career, and being named the Most Valuable Player of both the Holiday Festival and the National Invitational Tournament.\n\nLou Carnesecca era (1965\u20131992)\nLou Carnesecca was hired as the head basketball coach at St. John's in 1965, after serving as an assistant at St. John's since 1958, and given the difficult task to follow in the footsteps of Lapchick. In the 1985 NCAA tournament, he coached the Redmen to their second Final Four appearance. He was named the National Coach of the Year in 1983 and 1985 and Big East Coach of the Year on three occasions. His record at St. John's was 526\u2013200. Carnesecca led the team to its record fifth NIT title in 1989, to the NCAA's Elite Eight in 1979 and 1991, and to the Sweet Sixteen in 1967, 1969, and 1983.\nCarnesecca temporarily left St. John's to coach in the American Basketball Association from 1970 to 1973, when it was coached by former player Frank Mulzoff, who gathered a record of 56\u201327 and three post-season appearances.  Upon Carnesecca's return, he continued to guide the program to 29 consecutive postseason tournament appearances and to playing in a major conference, the Big East.\n\n1983 Big East Champions\n1985 NCAA Final Four\n1986 Big East Champions\nRecent years (1992\u2013present)\n2000 Big East Champions\n2003 NIT Champions\n2010\u201311 Senior team\n2011\u201312 Fresh Five team\n2024-2025 Big East Champions\n2025 Big East Champions\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Red Storm have appeared in the NCAA tournament 30 times.

St. John's fans also count other East Coast rivals the Villanova Wildcats, Providence Friars, Seton Hall Pirates, and former Big East founders Syracuse Orange and the Boston College Eagles along with the Connecticut Huskies and Pittsburgh Panthers among their most frequently played opponents.\n\nNew York rivalries\nSt. John's fifth most frequent played opponent is fellow Vincentian and Western New York college, the Niagara Purple Eagles. The universities have played each other every college basketball season since 1909. St. John's also frequently plays other New York City opponents representing the four other NYC boroughs; the Fordham Rams and Manhattan Jaspers of The Bronx, the St. Francis Terriers and LIU Blackbirds of Brooklyn, the NYU Violets and CCNY Beavers of Manhattan, and the Wagner Seahawks of Staten Island. These teams were all instrumental in creating the postseason National Invitational Tournament hosted annually at Madison Square Garden. From 1933 to 1963 most of these schools came together to play each other in the Metropolitan New York Conference. The Red Storm own an all-time record of 250\u201386 against these other New York City schools.\n\nSt. John's program records\nNotable players and coaches\nList of players and coaches honored:\n\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Members\nThe following St. John's players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Hall of Fame.\n\nMcDonald's High School All-Americans\nOlympians\nThe following St. John's players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games:\n\nPlayers in the NBA since 1979\nPlayers in International Basketball\nJustin Simon (born 1996) - basketball player for Bnei Herzliya of the Israeli Basketball Premier League\n\nAwards and honors\nNational award winners\nBig East Conference award winners\nMetropolitan Basketball Writers Association award winners\nFacilities\n* record stands after the 2023\u201324 season\n\nDeGray Gymnasium (1932\u20131956)\nDeGray Gymnasium was the original home of the St. John's Redmen when the university was located at 75 Lewis Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, NY. Their record at DeGray Gym was 156 wins to 11 losses for a winning percentage of .934. St. John's played their last home game there on December 8, 1956, with a victory of Roanoke College 103\u201365. When the university was transitioning from Brooklyn to Queens, the basketball team split their home games between the old Madison Square Garden and Martin Van Buren High School for five seasons.\n\nCarnesecca Arena (1961\u2013present)\nIn 1961, home games were moved to the 5,602-seat Alumni Hall on the newly constructed Queens campus opening with a 79\u201365 win over George Washington University.

The most recent record-breaking game was against Duke in 2019 with the crowd of 35,642 people. The JMA Dome is often considered one of the best home court advantages in college basketball.\nUnder former head coach Jim Boeheim, 10 Big East regular season championships, five Big East tournament championships, 35 NCAA tournament appearances (and 41 all-time), and three appearances in the national title game.\nIn 2015, after a lengthy investigation, the NCAA's Committee on Infractions ordered Syracuse to vacate 101 wins from five different seasons; however, the NCAA confirmed that sanctions did not include the removal of any trophies or banners, and Syracuse claims all of its NCAA Tournaments appearances and conference titles from those years. The investigation required Syracuse to vacate 79 wins from the 2006, 2007, and 2012 seasons.\n\nHistory\nEarly history\nBasketball started at Syracuse in February 1898 and Athletic Director John A. R. Scott served as the first coach. Syracuse fielded its first varsity basketball team in 1916\u201317.  The program rose to national prominence early in its history, being recognized by the Helms Athletic Foundation as national champions for 1918 (under Coach Edmund Dollard) and 1926.  The program made National Invitation Tournament appearances in 1946 and 1950, won the 1951 National Campus Tournament, and made its first NCAA men's basketball tournament appearance in 1957.  Notable early era players included Hall of Famer Vic Hanson and racial pioneer Wilmeth Sidat-Singh.\n\nNational emergence\nThe modern era of Syracuse basketball began with the arrival of future Hall of Famer Dave Bing. As a sophomore in 1964, Bing led the team to an NIT appearance and as a senior in 1966, he led the team to its second NCAA tournament appearance, where it reached the regional final.  Bing's backcourt partner on these teams was future Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim.\nSyracuse remained competitive after Bing's departure, with NIT appearances in 1967, 1971, and 1972.  Under coach Roy Danforth, in 1973, the team began a string of consecutive NCAA appearances highlighted by a Final Four appearance in 1975. The 1975 squad featured guard Jim Lee and forward Rudy Hackett and was affectionately known as \"Roy's Runts.\"\n\nBig East era (1979\u20132013)\nJim Boeheim takeover\nFollowing the 1976 season, Danforth was hired away by Tulane University and the university turned to young assistant Jim Boeheim (a native of Lyons, New York) to assume the helm. Boeheim extended the string of NCAA appearances to nine, with bids in each of his first four seasons, a period in which his teams won 100 games. These teams featured star forward Louis Orr and center Roosevelt Bouie, and were sometimes referred to as the \"Louie and Bouie Show.\"\n\nA new conference\nSyracuse was a founding member of the Big East Conference in 1979, along with UConn, Georgetown University, St. John's University and Providence College.  Syracuse and Georgetown were each ranked in the top ten in 1980, and a new and major rivalry blossomed when Georgetown snapped Syracuse's 57-game home winning streak in the final men's basketball game played at Manley Field House.  Over the next ten seasons, these two schools met eight times in the Big East tournament, four times in the finals, and met numerous times on national television during the regular season.\nSyracuse won the Big East tournament in 1981, but was passed over by the NCAA Tournament.  The team, featuring Danny Schayes and Leo Rautins, finished runner-up in the NIT. The team returned to the NIT in 1982, before beginning another extended streak of NCAA appearances in 1983.\n\nThe Pearl\nIn 1983, heralded high school phenomenon Dwayne \"Pearl\" Washington joined the team, and led the school to NCAA appearances in 1984, 1985, and 1986, before leaving school early for the NBA draft.\nWashington grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, where he acquired his nickname as an eight-year-old in a taunting comparison to Earl \"the Pearl\" Monroe. He was a playground phenomenon from Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, and was rated as the number one overall high school player in the United States 1983. He brought his flashy play to Syracuse University and the Carrier Dome. \"The Pearl\" was the master of the \"shake and bake\" and the \"cross-over\" moves.\n\nIt is believed that Pearl Washington brought Syracuse basketball to national prominence and helped usher the Big East into the national spotlight in the mid-1980s. In the Carrier Dome's first three years, Syracuse's highest attendance mark was a mere 20,401 in the 1982\u201383. In 1983, Pearl's freshman year, Syracuse's attendance increased to 22,380 per game. As a sophomore, Syracuse led the nation in attendance for the first time in school history. Syracuse would be the NCAA's attendance leader for the next ten years. By the time Washington was a junior, Syracuse's average attendance had jumped to 26,225. Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim, who has long said that there would be no Syracuse basketball program as we know it without Pearl, once said:He's the only guy who could just overnight fill the place like that. He had an unbelievable effect on our program. Everybody says that Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin made the Big East, but I think Pearl made the league. They were the best players, but Pearl was the player that people turned out to see and turned on their TVs to watch. We had the highest-rated games every year that Pearl was here. He was a guy who everybody wanted to see play. He not only helped make our program, he helped make the Big East and he helped college basketball.\nIn 2016, at the December 17 Georgetown game, joined alongside Washington's family, friends and former teammates, SU Director of Athletics John Wildhack helped unveil the No. 31 logo at center court to honor Washington. Washington died from brain cancer earlier that year eight months after being diagnosed. Washington has a street named after him in the Brownsville section of his native Brooklyn, New York.\n\nFalling just short\nDespite the early loss of Washington, Syracuse returned to the NCAAs in 1987, with a team featuring Rony Seikaly, Sherman Douglas and freshman Derrick Coleman, reaching the National Championship game before losing, 74\u201373, in the final to Indiana on a last-second jump shot by Keith Smart.  Led by Coleman, Douglas, Seikaly, Stephen Thompson and Billy Owens, the school extended its string of NCAA appearances to 10 seasons before that string was broken in 1993, due to NCAA sanctions resulting from an incident involving a booster.\nLed by guard Lawrence Moten and forward John Wallace, the school returned to the NCAAs in 1994 and 1995. In 1996, Wallace led the team to its third Final Four appearance and second National Championship game, where it played impressively before losing, 76\u201367, to a heavily favored Kentucky team that included nine future NBA players (Kentucky head coach Rick Pitino had been an assistant coach to Boeheim in 1976, 1977).\n\nA new millennium dawns\nThe 1997 squad won 19 games but was bypassed by the NCAA tournament and appeared in the NIT.  The 1998, 1999, and 2000 squads featuring guard Jason Hart and center Etan Thomas all earned NCAA bids. In 2000, the university also named its All-Century Team, recognizing its greatest players of the 20th century and the school's first 100 years of basketball.  The team made a fourth consecutive NCAA appearance in 2001, but returned to the NIT in 2002, despite having a 20-win season. This marked the first time a school with 20 wins from the Big East Conference was denied a bid to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nChampions at last\nAlthough unranked in the preseason polls for the 2002\u201303 season, led by freshmen Carmelo Anthony, Gerry McNamara and sophomore Hakim Warrick, the Orangemen won their first NCAA tournament championship with an 81\u201378 defeat of the University of Kansas in the final. Anthony was named NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player.\n\nAfter the crown\nAnthony left for the NBA draft after the school year, but McNamara and Warrick stayed on, leading the team to NCAA bids in 2004 and 2005. The latter season saw Syracuse introduce a new nickname, dropping \"Orangemen\" and \"Orangewomen\" in favor of \"Orange\".In 2006, McNamara would lead the Orange to an extremely unexpected Big East Championship victory, making the ninth-seeded Orange the lowest seed to ever win the championship and only the third school to repeat as Big East tournament champions, but was immediately defeated in the opening round of the 2006 NCAA tournament by Texas A&M, 66\u201358.\nThe 2007\u201308 season for the Orange was up and down. The Orange had a 50-point win over East Tennessee State on December 15, the largest margin of victory in 20 seasons.  They recorded top-25 wins over Georgetown and Marquette. But the team lost to Villanova in the Big East tournament opening round, and to UMass in the NIT. UMass became the first team ever to beat the Orange twice in the same season at the Carrier Dome.\nIn the 2008\u201309 season Syracuse was led by sophomore guard Jonny Flynn. The team returned key players like Eric Devendorf, Andy Rautins, Rick Jackson, Arinze Onuaku and Paul Harris. Syracuse gained a tremendous amount of media attention following a 127\u2013117 upset of UConn in six overtimes during the early morning hours of March 13, 2009 \"the Game that wouldn't end\" to advance to the semifinals of the Big East Conference tournament. This game solidified their seeding in the 2009 NCAA tournament. This game was the second longest of any game in NCAA History and only the fourth to make it into six overtimes.  However, they lost in the Big East Final. Syracuse received a 3 seed and beat Stephen F. Austin 59\u201344 in the first round. Syracuse stamped its ticket to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2004, defeating sixth seed Arizona State 78\u201367. However, the season ended with a loss to No. 2 seed Oklahoma, as the Sooners ended the Orange's season with an 84\u201371 loss.\nAt the start of the 2009\u201310 season, having lost three key players (Devendorf, Flynn, Harris) from the previous season, the Orange was not considered a top contender, unranked in the preseason AP Poll. An early exhibition game loss to local Le Moyne College, a Division II school, did little to improve the outlook. However, led by its starters, returning seniors Andy Rautins and Arinze Onuaku, junior Rick Jackson, a relatively unknown transfer from Iowa State University, forward Wes Johnson, freshman point guard Brandon Triche, plus standout reserve players, sophomores Kris Joseph and Scoop Jardine, the team began to deliver, winning its first 13 regular season games. By the second week of rankings, the Orange had climbed into the top ten, staying in the top five continuously from week 9. Syracuse reached a number one ranking two weeks before the season ended, finishing the season in fourth place with its best-ever regular season win\u2013loss performance, at 28\u20133.  It finished on top of the Big East for the regular season, losing in the Big East tournament's quarter finals. A 1-seed in the West Region of the 2010 NCAA tournament, the Orange fell in the Sweet Sixteen to 5-seed and AP #11 Butler to end the season 30\u20135.\nSenior Big East Defensive player of the Year Rick Jackson and Juniors Kris Joseph and Scoop Jardine led the 2010\u20132011 Orange. Syracuse started strong by winning their first 18 contests before losing in Pittsburgh. That loss started a slide for the Orange, who lost six of their next eight games. The Orange regained their momentum by beating the West Virginia Mountaineers to start a six-game winning streak before losing in overtime to the Connecticut Huskies in the semi-finals of the Big East tournament. With a record of 28\u20137, the Orange garnered a #3 seed in the East Region of the NCAA tournament. The Orange easily handled Indiana State 77\u201360 in their first game. The Orange faced Marquette in the second round when one of the tournament's more controversial moments occurred. With the game tied at 59 with 51 seconds left, a backcourt violation was called on the Orange when Scoop Jardine retrieved Dion Waiters' inbound pass with one foot landing in the front court before his second settled in the backcourt. NCAA officiating coordinator John Adams admitted the call was made in error however; the officials were unaware of the full rule. According to the 2010 and 2011 NCAA Men's and Women's Basketball Rulebook, Rule 4, Section 3, Article 8 states: \"After a jump ball or during a throw-in, the player in his/her front court, who makes the initial touch on the ball while both feet are off the playing court, may be the first to secure control of the ball and land with one or both feet in the back court. It makes no difference if the first foot down was in the front court or back court.\"  Marquette guard Darius Johnson-Odom hit a three-pointer on the ensuing possession with 27 second left to give the Golden Eagles the lead for good and a spot to the Sweet Sixteen. The loss culminated a season in which SU remained undefeated outside of their conference for the first time in the program's history.\n2012\u201313 was the school's last season in the Big East Conference.  Led by sophomore point guard Michael Carter-Williams and Junior forward C.J. Fair, the team made its fifth trip to the Final Four.\n\nAtlantic Coast Conference era (2013 \u2013 present)\nOn July 1, 2013, Syracuse, Notre Dame and Pittsburgh joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In its first season in the conference, Syracuse started 25\u20130 before losing six of its last nine games.  The team featured two Second Team All Americans, point guard Tyler Ennis and forward C.J. Fair, and finished second in the ACC regular season standings.\nThe Orange underperformed 2014\u201315 expectations with an 18\u201313 record behind First Team All-ACC center Rakeem Christmas. Though the team was not eligible for the NCAA tournament due to the self-imposed post-season ban by the university, this would change in the following 2015\u201316 season as the Orange made the Final Four as a 10-seed by defeating Dayton, Middle Tennessee, Gonzaga, and Virginia.\nThe following season Syracuse started ranked 19th in the AP Poll, but failed to make the NCAA tournament. In the 2017\u201318 season Syracuse would return to the NCAA tournament despite going 8\u201310 in conference play. In the tournament Syracuse upset 3-seeded Michigan State before losing to Duke in the Sweet 16. The next year saw the Orange make back-to-back NCAA tournament appearances for the first time since the 2013\u201314 season. They lost to Baylor in the opening round. On January 14, 2019, Syracuse upset Duke in Cameron Indoor Stadium, marking the first time that the Blue Devils had lost to an unranked team at home as the AP ranked number one team. They would lose to Baylor in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. Syracuse started the 2019\u201320 season slow, losing 48\u201334 to Virginia, the lowest amount ever scored by a team in Boeheim's career. SU would win its final game of the season in the ACC tournament beating North Carolina 81\u201353 and defeating the Tar Heels for the first time since 2014. This would be the last game played due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2020\u201321 season SU would once again upset its way to the Sweet 16 beating 3-seeded West Virginia before losing to eventual Final Four participant Houston.\n\nSyracuse University Athletics scandal\nThe NCAA's investigation into violations by Syracuse athletics date back to May 2007, following an initial report by the university to the NCAA, after the university learned that local YMCA employees paid some football and men's basketball student-athletes; Syracuse claims \"the NCAA\u2019s investigation of Syracuse has taken longer than any other investigation in NCAA history.\"\nIn March 2015, the NCAA released its infractions report which found that Syracuse had possibly violated rules. As a result, 101 wins were vacated by the NCAA in the 2004\u20132005, 2006\u20132007,  2010\u20132011, and 2011\u20132012 seasons.\nThe NCAA's ruling was confirmed by David Worlock, the NCAA's director of media coordination and statistics. Worlock is not part of the NCAA's Infractions or Enforcement offices. As the director of media coordination and statistics, he is working to update records based on the Committee on Infractions' sanctions. He said the COI's report on Syracuse differed from other investigations into violations at other schools in that it did not require the removal of championship trophies or banners signifying NCAA tournament appearances.\nAs a result, Syracuse retained the banner for its 2012 team's run to the NCAA Elite 8 and 2011 advancement to the third round of the NCAA tournament. Also, a Big East Conference official confirmed that the conference's updated media guide continues to list Syracuse as its 2005 and 2006 tournament champion.\n\nCoaches\n\u2020 including 101 victories vacated by NCAA\n\nFacilities\nArchbold Gymnasium\nSyracuse home games in the early years were played at Archbold Gymnasium, an on-campus gym that is still used for various university activities. It was built in 1908 with money donated by John Dustin Archbold, a major benefactor of the university, who also funded the building of Archbold Stadium, just to the west of the gymnasium (now the site of the Carrier Dome). After a 1947 fire, most home games were played at Syracuse's state fairgrounds' Coliseum and other local venues from 1947 to 1949.\n\nManley Field House\nIn 1962, home games moved to the newly constructed Manley Field House which finally gave the team a powerful home court advantage. At one time, the arena held 9,500 people for home games. The team became so fond of the space that its coaches objected to moving to the Carrier Dome when it was opened in 1980.\nOn February 13, 1980, the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team upset #2 ranked Syracuse 52\u201350 in the final planned, regular season game at Manley Field House, where the Orange boasted a 57-game home winning streak. Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr. would declare after the victory during the news conference that \"Manley Field House is officially closed\". The game gave birth to a rivalry, not just between schools but between two contrasting future Hall of Fame coaches.\nManley Field House hosted the ECAC Upstate Region tournament organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) in 1976 as well as a semifinal game of the 1977 ECAC South Region tournament.\n\nMelo Center\nThe Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center is the home of Syracuse basketball. The $19 million facility officially opened in September 2009. The facility includes two NCAA regulation-size practice courts, a weight room, training room, equipment room, locker rooms and coaches offices for both men's and women's basketball programs. In addition, fans can relive some of the greatest moments in Syracuse basketball history in the building's Hall of Fame Wing. The name comes from NBA star forward Carmelo Anthony, who was the major benefactor to the project.\n\nHome court\nThe JMA Wireless Dome\nBecause the Carrier Dome could not survive on a schedule of just 6 home football games a year, Syracuse Orange basketball team moved to their new home arena. In its setup for basketball, the Carrier Dome can hold crowds of more than 30,000 for its biggest games.\nThe Carrier Dome is the largest arena in NCAA DI basketball with a maximum capacity of 35,642. Syracuse's home court total attendance has led the nation 28 times, and its per-game average attendance has been ranked first 17 times since the opening of the Carrier Dome in 1980. Also, Syracuse has set and broken the NCAA on campus single game attendance record at the Carrier Dome 16 times. The most recent record-breaking game was against Duke in 2019 with a sellout crowd of 35,642 people.\nIn May 2018, the university announced a major renovation to the Carrier Dome as the central portion of a larger campus update. The renovation, estimated to cost $120 million, is expected to be completed in 2022. The most significant changes will be the replacement of the current air-supported roof with a fixed roof, two-thirds of which will be translucent, the installation of air conditioning and the largest centerhung videoboard in college sports. The upgrade will also include a new lighting and sound systems, Wi-Fi improvements, accessibility upgrades, improved restrooms, and new concession spaces.\n\nRecord breaking attendance\nMadison Square Garden\nThe Orange have been playing at Madison Square Garden since an encounter with Manhattan on February 1, 1939. The 2018\u201319 season marked the 37th consecutive campaign that Syracuse played at least once in the facility. The latest streak began in 1983\u201384. \n\n* record stands as of December 18, 2018, and does not reflect wins vacated by the NCAA from 2004 to 2007 and 2010 to 2012.\n\nRivalries\nThe original Big East was founded by seven charter schools in 1979 (Providence, St. John's, Georgetown, Syracuse, Seton Hall, Connecticut, and Boston College). Villanova joined the following year, followed by Pittsburgh in 1982. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Georgetown, Villanova, St. John's, and Syracuse were the primary powers in the conference with UConn joining them in the 1990s. In less than a decade after its inception, the Big East became the most successful college basketball league in America. The documentary 30 for 30: Requiem For The Big East by ESPN Films chronicles well the meteoric ascension of the Big East conference.\n\nSyracuse and Georgetown rivalry\nSyracuse and Georgetown rivalry \u2014 Syracuse's biggest rival is Georgetown. The two schools have been playing each other since 1930, but their rivalry was solidified in the 1980s as the respective programs were the leading powers during the infancy of the newly formed Big East conference. On February 13, 1980, the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team upset #2 ranked Syracuse 52\u201350 in the final planned, regular season game at Manley Field House, where the Orange boasted a 57-game home winning streak. Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr. would declare after the victory during the news conference that \"Manley Field House is officially closed\". The game gave birth to a rivalry, not just between schools but between two contrasting future Hall of Fame coaches.\nGeorgetown\u2013Syracuse rivalry has given the fans numerous memorable moments such as Michael Graham's punch during the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden in New York City; Pearl Washington's buzzer beater clutch shot to beat defending national champion and #1 team in the country at the Carrier Dome; and coach Thompson's three technical fouls and ejection in the controversial Orange victory.\nThe animosity between the programs was further extended when Syracuse announced their decision to leave the Big East effective in 2013 to join the ACC. Georgetown and Syracuse have continued to play each other in the next years following their exit from the conference.\nThe Georgetown\u2013Syracuse rivalry is regarded as one of college basketball's greatest rivalries between two storied programs.\n\nSyracuse and Connecticut rivalry\nThe first game played between the two schools took place on January 27, 1956, while the rivalry was at its height from 1979 to 2013 when both teams were members of the Big East Conference. The rivalry featured two Hall of Fame coaches, Jim Boeheim and Jim Calhoun. One of the highlights was the historic Big East tournament quarterfinal game in 2009, which took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Syracuse won 127\u2013117 in a game that went to six overtimes, ending at 1:22 AM.\n\nSyracuse and Villanova rivalry\nSyracuse and Villanova rivalry \u2014 Both schools have strong basketball traditions and are former Big East rivals. The strength of the basketball rivalry is evidenced by the fact that Syracuse v. Villanova games have attracted some of the biggest college basketball crowds ever, breaking the NCAA on campus basketball attendance record twice, including one game with a crowd of 34,616 people in 2010. However, this rivalry has an uncertain future because of the schools' recent separation (Syracuse in the ACC, and Villanova in the new Big East).\nThe Orange lead all-time series with each of their rivals.\n\nUpdated December 18, 2022\n\nChampionships\nPost-season success\nNCAA tournament seeding\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\n* played in the \"First Four\" round\n\nComplete NCAA tournament results\nThe Orange have appeared in the NCAA tournament 39 times.

From 1975 to 1982, the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) organized annual regional end-of-season men's basketball tournaments for independent Division I ECAC member colleges and universities in the Northeastern United States. The winner of each regional tournament was declared the ECAC regional champion for the season and received an automatic bid in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In 2013, Syracuse joined the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\n\u2020 \u2013 Indicates season for which the school's overall and/or conference record has been later adjusted by penalty, however the titles are claimed by the university\n\nConference regular-season champions\nSyracuse had been independent program until it joined the Big East Conference in 1979.

Syracuse teams have spent a total of 17 weeks ranked number 1, most recently in 2014.\n\n\u2020  The Associated Press began compiling a ranking of the top 20 college men's basketball teams during the 1948\u20131949 season. It has issued the poll continuously since the 1950\u20131951 season. Beginning with the 1989\u20131990 season, the poll expanded to 25 teams. \n^  Final ballot of The Coaches Poll.

Historically, Syracuse University has restricted the men's basketball team from wearing such numbers, but there have also been exceptions to this custom. An example of the former is Carmelo Anthony, who wore #22 in high school, but since the number was already \"retired\" at Syracuse, Anthony chose #15 as an alternate upon his arrival. Similarly, Gerry McNamara wore #31 in high school, also \"retired\" by Syracuse University (McNamara chose #3 instead).\n\nThe Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\nThe Mannie Jackson - Basketball's Human Spirit Award\nThe award is given annually to an individual who has found the game of basketball to be a contributing aspect to their personal growth and accomplishment, a place to develop an understanding of others, and an avenue that helped shape that individual's growth into a recognized visionary and leader.\n\nThe Curt Gowdy Media Award\nThe Basketball Hall of Fame's media award was established by the board of trustees to single out members of the electronic and print media for outstanding contributions to basketball.\n\nThe NBA 75th Anniversary Team\nThe NBA 75th Anniversary Team, also referred to as the NBA 75, was chosen in 2021 to honor the 75th anniversary of the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

    "biography": "The TCU Horned Frogs men's basketball team represents Texas Christian University, located in Fort Worth, Texas, in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition.  Since 2016, the Horned Frogs have been led by TCU Lettermen's Hall of Fame member, head coach Jamie Dixon. TCU has competed in the Big 12 Conference since 2012 and previously competed in the Mountain West Conference (2005\u20132012), Conference USA (2001\u20132005), Western Athletic Conference (1996\u20132001) and Southwest Conference (1923\u20131996).  The Horned Frogs play their home games on campus at Ed & Rae Schollmaier Arena, formerly known as Daniel\u2013Meyer Coliseum, which reopened in December 2015 after a $72 million renovation.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe Horned Frogs began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1908, when the university was located in Waco, Texas. In their first recorded game, the Frogs faced then-cross-town rival Baylor in a 6\u201337 loss; the Frogs notched their first recorded program win that same season versus the Waco YMCA. TCU moved its campus from Waco to Fort Worth, Texas, after a fire destroyed the central Texas' school's main building in 1910.  TCU competed as an independent and as part of the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association until joining Southwest Conference competition for the 1923\u201324 season, where the Frogs won their first-ever SWC game in a January 9, 1924, game at Rice University. During the early, independent and TIAA years, TCU was led by at least six different coaches from 1908 through 1923, and played five or fewer games or did not field teams in 7 of those 15 seasons.\n\n1920s\u20131970s Southwest Conference era\nThe Horned Frogs were led into the Southwest Conference in 1923 by a new basketball and football coach, Fort Worth native  Matty Bell.  Bell transformed the program, accruing a 71\u201341 (49\u201330 SWC) record over his six seasons at TCU and leading the Horned Frogs to second, third and fourth-place finishes during his tenure. Bell was succeeded by Francis Schmidt, who left the Arkansas Razorbacks to coach TCU basketball and football.  On the gridiron, Schmidt led the Frogs to their first SWC title and the gridiron in 1932, and on the hardwood, Schmidt led the Frogs to a combined 72\u201324 (41\u201319 SWC) record over five seasons and Southwest Conference championships in 1931 and 1934. The 1931 SWC championship was the Frogs' first league title in men's basketball.  Schmidt departed Fort Worth after five seasons to become the head football coach at Ohio State.\nCoach Schmidt's departure after the 1934 SWC championship season was followed by a 16-year drought for TCU basketball. TCU football coach Dutch Meyer fared far better leading the Frogs' football team, where he claimed two national championships, in 1935 and 1938, and three SWC football titles over his 19-year football-coaching tenure, than he did in his three seasons at the helm of TCU basketball.  Meyer's basketball record from 1934 through 1937 totaled on 10\u201337 (5\u201331 SWC).  Meyer was replaced by former TCU basketball and football player Mike Brumbelow, who had two SWC wins over the following four seasons, with an overall record of 22\u201364 (2\u201346 SWC). Brumbelow was quickly replaced by Hub McQuillan, who led the Frogs to middle-of-the-league finishes in the first 5 of his 7 years as head coach of TCU basketball.\nBuster Brannon, a former TCU player under Francis Schmidt, led Horned Frogs basketball for nearly two decades, from 1948 through 1967.  Brannon amassed a 205\u2013259 (104\u2013144 SWC) record over 19 seasons and led the Frogs to four Southwest Conference championships in 1951, 1952, 1953 and 1959, and the program's first three NCAA tournament appearances in 1952, 1953 and 1959. Brannon's recorded faded in the 1960s, when the Frogs finished near the bottom of the league almost every year until Brannon's retirement from coaching in 1967.  The Brannon era saw the opening of Daniel\u2013Meyer Coliseum (now Schollmaier Arena) in 1961. Johnny Swaim, a former player for Brannon, coached the Frogs from 1967 through 1977.  Swaim led the Frogs to Southwest Conference titles and the NCAA tournament in 1967, his first season at the helm, and in 1971. The Frogs' 1967 NCAA tournament appearance saw the Frogs' first-ever tournament win and the program's only appearance in what is now known as the Elite Eight. Swaim abruptly retired from coaching after the 1977 season, remaining in Fort Worth as a businessman until his death in 1995.  After Swaim's retirement, Tim Somerville led the Frogs for the following two seasons, notching only a 10\u201343 (3\u201329 SWC) record.\n\nJamie Dixon era\nOn March 21, 2016, TCU hired Pitt head coach and former Horned Frogs' letterman Jamie Dixon as the Frogs' next head basketball coach. Prior to his return to Fort Worth as the 22nd head coach of TCU basketball, Dixon spent 13 years as the head coach at Pitt, won four national coach of the year awards, and ranked as the 9th winningest, active Division I head coach. Dixon's impact at TCU was immediate, where in his first season he landed Jaylen Fisher, the highest-rated recruit in TCU history, led the Frogs to their best conference record and finish, best overall record, and first postseason tournament since joining the Big 12 in 2012, and knocked off the No. 1 ranked Kansas Jayhawks in the 2017 Big 12 Tournament in Kansas City\u2013marking the program's first-ever win over a #1 ranked team.  The Horned Frogs won the 2017 NIT Championship on March 30, to cap off Dixon's first season with a 24\u201315 record. The Horned Frogs qualified as an at-large bid for the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, snapping a 20-year drought.\nTCU made the NCAA tournament in 2022.  They defeated Seton Hall 69\u201342 in the first round winning an NCAA tournament game for the first time in 35 years.\n\nSeason-by-season results\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament\nThe Horned Frogs have appeared in 11 NCAA tournaments.

  "Temple Owls": {
    "biography": "The Temple Owls men's basketball team represents Temple University in the sport of basketball. The Owls compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I as a member of the American Athletic Conference (The American). They play their home games in the Liacouras Center on the university's main campus in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and are currently led by head coach Adam Fisher. Temple is the sixth-most winningest NCAA Division I men's college basketball program of all time, with 2,000 wins.  \nTemple won the inaugural National Invitation Tournament in 1938, and with it the national championship, in the season prior to the first NCAA tournament. They won the NIT again in 1969. Although Temple has competed in the NCAA tournament over thirty times, they are one of nine programs with that many appearances to have not won the tournament and one of four to have never reached the NCAA championship game. They recorded third-place NCAA finishes in 1956 and 1958.\nOn March 7, 2012, the Temple Owls announced that they would be rejoining the Big East Conference for all sports in 2013 after 31 years in the Atlantic 10 Conference, with the Owls football team membership beginning in the 2012 season. However, before Temple became an all-sports member of the Big East, the conference split along football lines. The league's non-FBS football schools formed a new Big East in 2013, while Temple and the remaining football members remained in the old conference, but renamed it the American Athletic Conference.\n\nHistory\nThe Temple Owls became the first National Invitation Tournament (NIT) champions in 1938, one year before the inception of the NCAA Tournament. The NIT was broadly recognized as a national championship-caliber tournament for a number of years, beginning with the 1938 national championship won by Temple. Additionally, the Owls were retroactively recognized by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll and the Helms Athletic Foundation as the national champion for the 1937\u201338 season. Temple again won the NIT championship in 1969.\nDuring the 1950s, the Temple basketball team made two NCAA Final Four appearances in (1956, 1958) under head coach Harry Litwack. Litwack was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame after concluding a 21-year coaching career that included 373 wins.\nHead Coach John Chaney, also a Hall of Famer, won a total of 741 career games (312 losses) and took Temple to the NCAA tournament 17 times in 24 seasons with the Owls. His teams won the Atlantic 10 regular season championship eight times, while winning the A-10 Tournament six times. His 1987\u201388 Owls team entered the NCAA tournament ranked No. 1 in the country, but lost in the Elite Eight to Duke. Chaney reached the Elite Eight on five occasions and was the consensus National Coach of the Year in 1988. On March 13, 2006, Chaney retired from coaching.\nOn April 10, 2006, Penn head coach and La Salle alumnus Fran Dunphy was named the new head coach. Dunphy had coached the Quakers for 17 straight seasons prior to the move. After struggling his first year, the Owls won the A-10 Tournament for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010. The Owls received bids to the NCAA Tournament for six straight years under Dunphy (2008\u20132013). However, the Owls only won a game in the Tournament twice during that time period. Since Temple joined the American Athletic Conference in 2013, the Owls have struggled, making the NCAA Tournament only in 2016 and 2019.\nAfter the 2018 season it was announced that former Owls standout and then-assistant coach Aaron McKie would take over for Dunphy in 2019. \nPlayers Mark Macon, Juan Ignacio Sanchez, Eddie Jones, Lavoy Allen, Aaron McKie, Tim Perry and Mardy Collins are just a few who have gone on to play in the NBA.\n\nRivalries\nAs a member of the Big 5, the five large colleges in Philadelphia, the Owls have long-standing rivalries with Villanova, Penn, Saint Joseph's, and La Salle. The Owls are tied with Villanova for the most Big 5 titles to date, with 27. However, while tied in overall titles, Villanova has more outright titles not shared by any other tying team. The Owls have not won an outright Big 5 title since the 2000\u201301 season. The Owls won their most recent Big 5 title in 2022\u201323, going 3\u20131 in Big 5 play and splitting the title with Villanova. During Big 5 games, the Temple student section unfurls long banners about the opposing team, which has been a Big 5 trademark for Temple.\nOther rivals include UMass, UConn, and Cincinnati. Temple was in the American Athletic Conference with UConn and Cincinnati until their departures in 2020 and 2023, respectively. When Temple was in the A-10, head coach John Chaney had a personal rivalry with UMass head coach John Calipari.\n\nAwards and honors\nRetired numbers\nNational Awards\nAll Americans\nMike Bloom \u2013 1938\nBill Mlkvy \u2013 1951\nGuy Rodgers \u2013 1957, 1958\nBill Kennedy \u2013 1960\nTerrence Stansbury \u2013 1984\nNate Blackwell \u2013 1987\nMark Macon \u2013 1988\nPepe Sanchez \u2013 2000\n\nNational Coach of the Year\nJohn Chaney \u2013 1987, 1988\n\nConference awards\nAtlantic 10 Conference (1982\u20132013)\nAtlantic 10 Player of the Year \nTerrence Stansbury \u2013 1983\u201384\nGranger Hall \u2013 1984\u201385\nNate Blackwell \u2013 1986\u201387\nTim Perry \u2013 1987\u201388\nMark Macon \u2013 1988\u201389\nAaron McKie \u2013 1992\u201393\nEddie Jones \u2013 1993\u201394\nMarc Jackson \u2013 1996\u201397\nPepe Sanchez \u2013 1999\u201300\nKhalif Wyatt \u2013 2012\u201313\nAtlantic 10 Sixth Man of the Year\nQuincy Wadley \u2013 1998\u201399\nLynn Greer \u2013 1999\u201300\nBrian Polk \u2013 2001\u201302\nRamone Moore \u2013 2009\u201310\nKhalif Wyatt \u2013 2010\u201311\nAtlantic 10 Most Improved Player\nDionte Christmas \u2013 2006\u201307\nScootie Randall \u2013 2010\u201311\nAtlantic 10 Coach of the Year \nJohn Chaney \u2013 1983\u201384, 1984\u201385, 1986\u201387, 1987\u201388, 1999\u201300\nFran Dunphy \u2013 2009\u201310, 2011\u201312\n\nAmerican Athletic Conference (2013\u2013Present)\nAmerican Athletic Conference Most Improved Player\nNate Pierre-Louis \u2013 2019\nAmerican Athletic Conference Coach of the Year\nFran Dunphy \u2013 2015, 2016\n\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\nHarry Litwack \u2013 1976\nJohn Chaney \u2013 2001\nGuy Rodgers \u2013 2014\n\nOwls in pro basketball\nNBA drafted players\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Owls have appeared in the NCAA tournament 33 times.

  "Tennessee Volunteers": {
    "biography": "The Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team is the collegiate men's basketball program for the University of Tennessee\u2013Knoxville. The Volunteers (commonly referred to as the \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Volunteers play their home games in Thompson\u2013Boling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season. \nHistorically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins. The Volunteers have appeared 27 times in the NCAA tournament, most recently in 2025. The team appeared in the Elite Eight in 2010, 2024 and 2025, its deepest tournament runs in program history. Many notable players have played collegiately at Tennessee\u2014players such as Bernard King, Dale Ellis, Allan Houston, Tobias Harris, Grant Williams, and Dalton Knecht who all play(ed) in the NBA. Chris Lofton, Ron Slay, Tyler Smith, Tony White, and John Fulkerson are also notable players who later played professionally in other leagues.\nThe Volunteers are currently coached by Rick Barnes, who was hired on March 31, 2015, to replace Donnie Tyndall.\n\nHistory\nRay Mears era\nBuilding the foundation: \"This is Big Orange Country!\"\nIn 1963, the University of Tennessee hired Ray Mears to become the head coach of the men's basketball program. The hiring of Mears, who was coming off an NCAA small college championship at Wittenberg University, ushered in the most sustained period of success in Tennessee men's basketball history.\nIn his first year, Mears's Volunteers improved from a 4\u201319 record in 1962 to 13\u201311, highlighted by two wins over the Kentucky Wildcats. Before Mears, Tennessee had only beaten the Wildcats twice in 39 meetings. Throughout his career, Mears gained notoriety throughout the SEC for frequently being a thorn in the powerhouse Kentucky's side. In an era where Kentucky was coached by future College Basketball Hall of Fame members Adolph Rupp and Joe B. Hall, winning 75% of their games, Mears recorded a 15\u201315 record against the Wildcats.\nLed by A. W. Davis, the Volunteers finished second in the SEC in each of the next two seasons and recorded 20 wins in 1965, reaching that mark for the first time in 17 years. This success and the resultant growing fan support led to the university's decision to expand the 7,500-seat Amory-Fieldhouse to 12,700 seats. It was renamed Stokely Athletic Center to honor William B. Stokely, whose donation funded the renovation.\nIn the expanded Stokely Center's inaugural season, the Volunteers captured the 1967 SEC championship and made the program's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. Dubbed the \"Fearless Five,\" the 1967 team won road games against top conference teams Florida, Kentucky, and Mississippi State. The win over Mississippi State, coming in double-overtime on a pair of Bill Justus free throws, secured Tennessee's first SEC championship in 24 years and is referred to by some as the greatest basketball game in Tennessee history.\nFrom 1968 to 1973, Mears kept Tennessee among the top teams of the SEC, winning a second SEC championship in 1972 and finishing second in every year except 1970.\n\n\"The Ernie and Bernie Show\"\nIn 1974, Mears and his trusted assistant Stu Aberdeen were able to recruit New York City standout forward Ernie Grunfeld to Knoxville. In his freshman season, Grunfeld led the team in scoring, averaging 17.4 points per game, and received first-team All-SEC honors.\n\nThe following season, Grunfeld was joined by fellow New Yorker Bernard King. Known as \"The Ernie and Bernie Show,\" King and Grunfeld led the Volunteers to a 61\u201320 record over three years and an SEC championship in 1977. During their three years together, Tennessee posted a 5\u20131 record against Kentucky. The Volunteers reached the National Invitation Tournament in 1975 and the NCAA tournament in 1976 and 1977. King was named first-team All-American and SEC Player of the Year in 1975 and 1976, and then shared the honor with Grunfeld in 1977, with both being named SEC Co-Player of the Year.\nGrunfeld graduated from Tennessee in 1977 and King chose to forgo his senior year to enter the NBA draft. King was drafted 7th overall to the New Jersey Nets and Grunfeld went 11th overall to the Milwaukee Bucks. Both enjoyed long and illustrious NBA careers.\nPerhaps the biggest impact of the \"Ernie and Bernie\" show was how it changed the national perception of the Tennessee basketball program. This \"Double Trouble from Tennessee\" was featured in the February 1976 edition of Sports Illustrated. In 2013, ESPN premiered a 30 for 30 documentary called \"Bernie and Ernie\" about the all-time great Volunteer basketball players.\n\nExit and legacy\nFollowing the exit of his two biggest stars, Mears, who long struggled with depression, was not able to coach the team in 1978. Under the watch of interim coach Cliff Wettig, the Volunteers struggled to an 11\u201316 record, and Mears officially retired for health reasons after the season.\nMears is remembered not only as the greatest coach in Tennessee men's basketball history, but also as a great entertainer and marketer. From the beginning of his time at Tennessee, Mears employed marketing tactics to get fans to games\u2014from his patented and provocative orange blazer, to his introduction of the Pride of the Southland Band to basketball games, to his entertaining pre-game warmups that compared to the Harlem Globetrotters for creativity. At the beginning of his tenure, Mears declared, \"This is Big Orange Country,\" and this slogan has lived on long past his coaching years.\n\nDon DeVoe era\nDon DeVoe was named Mears's successor and took over as head coach for the 1979 season. Despite the losing record in 1978, DeVoe inherited a roster centered on All-American center Reggie Johnson. DeVoe's 1979 Volunteers finished the regular season with a 21\u201312 record, beating Kentucky twice and earning a second-place finish in the SEC. The 1979 SEC tournament was the first held in 27 years, and the Volunteers reached the tournament finals, where they once again defeated Kentucky by a score of 75\u201369 to win their first SEC Tournament championship since 1943. With the tournament championship win, the Volunteers were invited back to the NCAA tournament, where they recorded the program's first NCAA tournament win with a defeat of Eastern Kentucky. Tennessee was eliminated in the second round with a loss to Notre Dame.\nDeVoe led Tennessee to the NCAA tournament each of the next five years, but none of his teams advanced past the second round. Through his first seven years at UT, DeVoe compiled an overall record of 143\u201379 (.644). The program's momentum under his direction eventually weakened, however, and the Volunteers were not invited to the NCAA tournament or the NIT in 1986 or 1987.\nEntering the 1989 season, DeVoe's 11th year at Tennessee, his teams had not reached the NCAA tournament or finished above 6th in the SEC since 1983. DeVoe led the Volunteers to a 19\u201311 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament. After an 84\u201368 loss to West Virginia in the first round, DeVoe resigned.\nThe growth of UT basketball under DeVoe is still seen today in the Vols' current home arena, Thompson\u2013Boling Arena, which was built during his tenure. By the mid-1980s, the overflow crowds had grown too large for the 12,700-seat Stokley Athletic Center. In 1988, the Volunteers moved to the new $30 million Thompson\u2013Boling Arena, which seated over 24,500 people\u2014at the time, the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States. Sitting on the banks of the Tennessee River nearby historic Neyland Stadium, the arena has accommodated 21,678 people since a 2007 renovation.\n\nHouston, O'Neill, Green, and Peterson\nIn 1990, Wade Houston, an Alcoa, Tennessee native and former assistant coach at Louisville, became the first African-American head coach in Tennessee and SEC history. Houston's son, Allan Houston, came to UT to play for his father and would become one of the most accomplished players in Tennessee history. With 2801 points, Allan Houston finished his career as Tennessee's all-time leading scorer and was named All-American in 1992 and 1993.\nHouston was fired after a 5\u201322 campaign in 1994, finishing the worst season in Tennessee history. None of his teams reached the NCAA tournament, and only two of his teams received invitations to the NIT, the two of which were also his only teams to finish with winning records. Houston finished with an overall record of 65\u201390 at Tennessee.\nHouston was replaced by Kevin O'Neill in 1995. O'Neill\u2014an intense and somewhat high-strung sideline coach, but also a skilled recruiter\u2014took over a program depleted in talent. He was able to sign talented players such as Brandon Wharton, Tony Harris, and Isiah Victor. O'Neill left Tennessee to become the head coach at Northwestern after the 1997 season.\nO'Neill was replaced by Oregon Ducks head coach Jerry Green. Green inherited a roster with significant young talent and was able to an immediate improvement in on-court success. His first Tennessee team produced a 20\u20139 overall record\u2014a nine-win improvement over the 11\u201316 record of O'Neill's third and final UT team\u2014and advanced to the 1998 NCAA tournament. In his second year, Green's Volunteers won the 1999 SEC East Division championship and defeated Kentucky twice in the same season for the first time since 1979, in what is generally regarded to be the best overall year in school athletics history. (The 1998 Tennessee Football team finished 13\u20130 and won the first-ever BCS National Championship. In women's basketball, Pat Summitt led the Lady Volunteers to a 39\u20130 NCAA championship season, the program's third consecutive national title.)\nThe 2000 Tennessee men's basketball team finished 26\u20137, repeating as SEC East champions, winning the Volunteers' first SEC championship since 1982, and setting a program record for most wins in a single season. In the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers advanced to the first Sweet Sixteen in school history, where they lost a close contest to North Carolina.\nGreen's Volunteers began the 2001 season with a 16\u20131 record, rising to No. 4 in the AP Poll. Beginning with a ten-point loss at Kentucky in mid-January, Tennessee then struggled to a 22\u201311 finish. Green's team advanced to the NCAA tournament\u2014the fourth appearance in Green's four seasons\u2014losing in the first round. Coupled with his multiple incidents with local media and Tennessee fans, this disappointing finish to the season led to Green's resignation.\nHe was replaced by Buzz Peterson, who failed to lead the program to an NCAA tournament berth in his four years as head coach. He was fired after the 2005 season, in which his team finished 14\u201317.\n\nBruce Pearl era\nRevival in Big Orange Country\nAfter taking Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee to a Sweet Sixteen in 2005, Bruce Pearl was hired as the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Pearl's assistants Tony Jones, Steve Forbes, Jacob Nichols, Jason Shay, and Ken Johnson were part of a staff that would help to lead the Volunteers to the NCAA tournament six years in a row.\n\n2005\u201306\nPearl inherited a roster that had not experienced much winning, but showed promise with future NBA senior point guard C. J. Watson and All-SEC freshman team shooting guard Chris Lofton.\nPearl's coaching, which included playing an up-tempo style and pressing defense, led to immediate gains for Tennessee. In his first season, Pearl led the Volunteers to a 22\u20138 record, an SEC East Division championship, and a no. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Pearl's first team achieved some of the more memorable wins in program history, including two wins against the eventual national champion Florida Gators. Another memorable win came when Chris Lofton, who is a Kentucky native, led the Volunteers over Kentucky in Rupp Arena for the program's first win there since 1999.\n\n2006\u201307\nPearl's 2006 recruiting class was ranked among the top ten in college basketball. Despite the influx of freshmen and their inexperience, the Volunteers were able to open with a 13\u20132 start to the season. All-American guard Chris Lofton was injured and missed a good portion of January and early February, during which time the Volunteers opened 3\u20135 in SEC play. After Lofton returned, Tennessee won 7 out of their last 8 regular season games. Given a no. 5 seed, the Volunteers returned to the Sweet Sixteen where they faced no. 1 seed Ohio State. Tennessee led 49\u201332 at halftime, but the eventual NCAA runner-up Buckeyes mounted a comeback to defeat the Volunteers by a score of 85\u201384.\nDuring the 2006\u201307 season, the Volunteers were ranked 4th nationally in attendance, with an average of 19,661 fans in Thompson\u2013Boling Arena, which has a capacity of 21,758. This marked an increase in attendance of an average of 7,436 per game since Pearl arrived in March 2005.\n\n2007\u201308\nPreseason expectations for the Volunteers were high entering the 2008 season. Chris Lofton was a preseason pick by some to win National Player of the Year, and he was joined by Tyler Smith, an All-Big Ten freshman transfer from Iowa. Senior guards JaJuan Smith and Jordan Howell, along with rising sophomores Wayne Chism and Ramar Smith, propelled the Volunteers to a preseason no. 7 ranking.\nThe team posted a record of 28\u20133 in the regular season. The season was highlighted by the rivalry matchup between Tennessee and Memphis. John Calipari's Tigers were undefeated and ranked no. 1 and the Volunteers were no. 2. In front the largest TV audience to date to ever watch a game on ESPN, the two teams remained evenly matched for thirty-nine minutes. The Volunteers trailed 61\u201360 with 30 seconds left before Tyler Smith made a jump-shot to give UT the lead. The Volunteers added three free throws and took the contest by a score of 66\u201362. The following Monday, Tennessee was ranked no. 1 in polls for the first time in school history.\nThe Volunteers finished the regular season as the outright SEC champions and the no. 1 seed for the SEC Tournament in Atlanta. The Volunteers won their first game to set up a semifinal matchup against Arkansas in the Georgia Dome. The night before the game, an EF2 tornado hit Downtown Atlanta, damaging the Georgia Dome and much of the surrounding area. Because of this, the tournament was nearly canceled but was ultimately moved to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The Razorbacks were able to upset the Volunteers, denying them a place in the final and a shot at their first SEC Tournament championship in 30 years.\nThe Volunteers received a no. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball. Despite the disappointing ending, the 2008 season is remembered as one of the best in program history.\n\n2008\u201309\nReplacing Chris Lofton proved a difficult task in the 2009 season. Now led by Tyler Smith, the Volunteers finished with a 21\u201313 record. However, Tennessee claimed another SEC division championship. The Volunteers advanced to the SEC Tournament Championship in Tampa before losing to Mississippi State 64\u201361. The Volunteers lost their NCAA tournament first-round game to Oklahoma State.\n\n2009\u201310\nEntering the regular season ranked in the top 10, the Volunteers started the season 10\u20132. On New Year's Day, players Melvin Goins, Cam Tatum, Brian Williams, and leading scorer Tyler Smith were arrested after a traffic stop when police found marijuana and an illegal firearm. The players were all suspended for multiple games and Tyler Smith was eventually dismissed from the team.\nAfter the suspensions, the Volunteers were left with only six scholarship players. The Volunteers defeated Charlotte and then hosted no. 1 Kansas the next game. In front of a sellout crowd, the undermanned Volunteers defeated the Jayhawks 76\u201368. Tennessee cemented its lead with a shot clock-beating three-point shot with under a minute left by local freshman walk-on Skylar McBee, who entered the rotation due to the suspensions.\nTennessee rode the momentum of the Kansas upset to a 23\u20137 regular season record. This included another upset of second-ranked Kentucky, which featured future NBA All-Stars John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins, as well as four other eventual NBA players. The Volunteers won 74\u201365 at home in front of a raucous crowd. The Wildcats were able to avenge the loss a week and half later in the SEC Tournament.\nAs a no. 6 seed in a bracket featuring overall top seed Kansas, the Volunteers defeated a Steve Fisher-coached San Diego State team with Kawhi Leonard in the first round. No. 14 seed Ohio upset the no. 3 seed Georgetown Hoyas, setting up a matchup between the Volunteers and the Bobcats in the following round. After winning 83\u201368, Tennessee advanced to Bruce Pearl's third Sweet Sixteen in five years.\nIn a rematch of the 2007 Sweet Sixteen, the Volunteers faced the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. In a back and forth battle with the Evan Turner-led Buckeyes, Tennessee held a 76\u201373 lead with 13 seconds left. Turner missed a three-point shot, rebounded his own missed shot, and attempted a final three-point shot that was blocked by J. P. Prince, securing the Volunteers an appearance in the Elite Eight for the first time in program history.\nTennessee faced Michigan State in the Elite Eight. After a fast start, the Vols sputtered in the second half and Michigan State was able to keep the game close. Down by one point with 11 seconds left, Tennessee's Scotty Hopson was set to attempt two free throws. He made the first but missed the second. With the score tied, Michigan State advanced the ball and was fouled on a fast break. Raymar Morgan made one of two free throws, and Michigan State was able to defeat Tennessee one game short of the Final Four.\n\n2010\u201311\nTennessee opened the 2010\u201311 season with success, winning the Preseason NIT and rising as high as no. 7 in the national polls. In mid-December, the NCAA announced an investigation into Bruce Pearl for his role in a possible recruiting violation. SEC Commissioner Mike Slive suspended Pearl for the first half of the SEC season. Tennessee faltered throughout the rest of the season to a 19\u201315 record. Tennessee appeared in the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year under Pearl and faced Michigan in the opening round. The Volunteers were defeated 75\u201345 in what proved to be Pearl's last game.\nOn March 21, 2011, the week after the loss, the university announced the firing of Pearl, based on Pearl's misconduct of lying to the NCAA in the ongoing investigation. Pearl was eventually given a three-year show-cause penalty.\n\nCuonzo Martin and Donnie Tyndall\nOn March 27, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced the hiring of Cuonzo Martin as the Volunteers' 18th head coach. Martin had spent the prior three seasons at Missouri State, where he compiled a record of 61\u201341. Martin was able to lead the Missouri State team from an 11\u201320 record and a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference to a 26\u20139 record and a first-place conference finish.\n\nMartin took over a depleted roster with low expectations. After the departure of Tobias Harris following his freshman season, the Volunteers were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC in 2011\u201312. With the emergence of Jordan McRae and Jeronne Maymon, and the mid-season addition of Jarnell Stokes, Martin took a team that had lost their top three\u2014and seven of their top ten\u2014contributors from the previous season to a second-place finish in the SEC, largely because of their tough defense and lack of turnovers. With an outside chance at the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers lost their first SEC tournament game to Ole Miss, ending their NCAA chances. They played in the NIT before losing in the second round.\nIn 2012\u201313, the Volunteers started off slowly, posting an 11\u201310 record before finishing the regular season 8\u20131. UT was eliminated in the second round of the SEC Tournament and was left out of the NCAA tournament for the second straight year, finishing as one of the last teams out.\nExpectations were high heading into 2013\u201314 with a roster many felt could compete for a Sweet Sixteen appearance. However, the fans quickly grew vocally upset after another slow start of 16\u201311. A petition with thousands of signatures surfaced online for the firing of Cuonzo Martin and the re-hiring of Bruce Pearl, whose show-cause order was ending the next year. Whether the petition motivated the team or not, the Volunteers finished the season 5\u20131 and earned a place in the \"First Four\" round of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Iowa in the play-in game in Dayton, Ohio to move on to face the UMass Minutemen. Martin's Volunteers, who were the lower seed, were favored by many and easily defeated UMass. In one of the biggest upsets in tournament history, Mercer upset Duke, and the Volunteers went on to defeat Mercer to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Tennessee then played Michigan in Indianapolis. In front of one of the largest crowds to witness a Sweet Sixteen game, the Volunteers' comeback fell short and UT lost to Michigan by a score of 73\u201371.\nMartin resigned from Tennessee and accepted the coaching job at California on April 15, 2014. After a brief coaching search, Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart announced on April 21, 2014 that former Morehead State and Southern Mississippi head coach Donnie Tyndall would become the next head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.\nTyndall inherited a roster that returned one contributing player from the previous year. Also, due to Jarnell Stokes's decision to enter the NBA draft and two other players transferring, Tyndall had to recruit and sign nearly one-third of the 2015 team's roster in less than a month. Under these circumstances, he led the 2015 team to a 16\u201316 record.\nAfter the season was over, Tennessee announced it was firing Tyndall with cause after it learned that he had lied to both UT and the NCAA about the severity of major NCAA violations that had occurred at Southern Miss. Hart said that he would have never hired Tyndall had the true extent of the violations been known. By this time, it was clear that Tyndall would face severe penalties for his role in the violations, including a suspension for part of the season. According to ESPN, Hart and other officials were still smarting from Pearl having to sit out the first half of conference play three years earlier, and were not willing to face the prospect of an equally lengthy suspension for Tyndall.\n\nRick Barnes era\nOn March 31, 2015, Rick Barnes was named the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Barnes boasted the best record of any incoming coach in school history, with an overall record of 604\u2013314 from his previous tenures at Texas, Clemson, and Providence. Barnes is originally from nearby Hickory, North Carolina, and his wife, Candy, graduated from Tennessee in 1975. The Rick Barnes era began on a winning note as Tennessee defeated UNC Asheville, 82\u201378 in Barnes' debut game at UT.\nIn Barnes' third year as Tennessee's coach, he completed quite the turnaround from the previous year's 16\u201316 (8\u201310) team, as his team would finish the regular season 26\u20139 (13\u20135) and capture a share of the SEC regular season title. This would be Tennessee's first regular season title since 2008 and tenth overall. Tennessee also reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Kentucky 77\u201372.\nIn 2019, Tennessee won 30 games for the first time since 2007-08. The Volunteers would earn a record of 31\u20136 (15\u20133) including an 18-game win streak and a No.1 ranking in the polls for the first time since the 2007\u201308 season. The Volunteers again reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Auburn 84\u201364. The Volunteers proceeded to earn a No. 2 seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Colgate 77\u201370 in the first round. Tennessee overcame a resurgent Iowa Hawkeyes team in the second round by a score of 83\u201377 in an overtime thriller. The Volunteers fell to Purdue in the Sweet Sixteen in overtime after a thrilling come-from-behind run led by Volunteer guard Admiral Schofield. Purdue's Ryan Cline kept the Boilermakers in the game late and after a controversial call on Lamonte Turner, the Vols lost. Junior forward Grant Williams captured the 2018\u201319 SEC player of the year award, his second consecutive year obtaining the honor.\n\nSeason\u2013by\u2013season results\nSource\n\nFacilities\nTennessee plays its home games in Thompson\u2013Boling Arena, which was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States, with a seating capacity of 24,678 until its 2007 renovation. Named for the late B. Ray Thompson and former UT President Dr. Edward J. Boling, the arena regularly hosts women's volleyball matches, concerts, camps, conferences, and other special events throughout the year.\nThompson\u2013Boling Arena opened during the 1987\u201388 season, with Tennessee defeating Marquette 82\u201356 before a crowd of 25,272. In its opening season, the Volunteers finished third nationally in attendance, with an average attendance of more than 20,000 fans per game. Much of the facility's storied history has centered on men's and women's basketball. In the last two decades, the Volunteers and Lady Volunteers have hosted record college basketball crowds, as well as WNBA and NCAA tournament basketball games. The Volunteers have ranked fourth in the nation in average home attendance for each of the past three seasons, including an average of 20,483 fans per game in 2008\u201309. Tennessee's 1989 men's game against Kentucky set the SEC regular-season record with a crowd of 25,610. The Lady Volunteers drew 24,597 fans for their 1998 game with Connecticut to establish a women's NCAA record, while a Celtics-Bullets game in 1988 attracted a then-NBA-record exhibition crowd of 23,611. The arena's largest basketball crowd since its capacity was reduced to 21,678 prior to the 2007\u201308 season came on January 7, 2009, when the Vols hosted Gonzaga in front of a sellout crowd of 22,326.\nUT hosted the NCAA tournament's South Regional Finals in 1994 and 1999 in the spacious facility, as well as the 1990 NCAA Southeast Region's first- and second-round games and the NCAA women's 1990 Final Four. The 1989 SEC Tournament was the first of what promised to be many postseason tournaments to be held in Thompson\u2013Boling Arena. The riverfront arena has drawn rave reviews from teams, administrators, and media for its modern facilities needed for hosting major tournaments.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Volunteers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 27 times. Their combined record is 31\u201328.\n\nNIT results\nThe Volunteers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times.

The Volunteers (commonly referred to as the \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Volunteers play their home games in Thompson\u2013Boling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season. \nHistorically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins.

    "biography": "The Texas A&M Aggies men's basketball team represents Texas A&M University in NCAA Division I college basketball. The Aggies compete in the Southeastern Conference. Since 1998, the teams has played its home games at Reed Arena, a 12,989-capacity arena in College Station, Texas on the campus of Texas A&M University. Texas A&M has appeared in the NCAA tournament 17 times, most recently in 2025.\n\nHistory\nMetcalf era\nShelby Metcalf took over the A&M basketball program in 1963.  His impact was immediate, winning the Southwest Conference with a 13\u20131 conference record for Texas A&M's first title in 13 years.  In his 26 years as head coach at Texas A&M, he won six Southwest Conference titles, two Southwest Conference tournament titles, and led A&M to six NCAA tournament and four NIT appearances.  He was fired by former A&M football player and then-athletic director John David Crow after coaching 19 games of the 1989\u20131990 season. When asked by the media what happened between the two, Metcalf remarked, \"I made a comment that I didn't think John David was all that bright. And I thought I was being generous.\"  Metcalf finished his career at A&M with an overall record of 438\u2013306, making him the all-time winningest men's basketball coach in Southwest Conference history.\n\nThe Dark Ages\nAfter Metcalf was fired, A&M went through the next 14 years making only one postseason appearance (1994 NIT), finished above .500 in conference play only twice, and posted an overall record of .500 or above only twice.  John Thornton finished out the 1990 season as head coach after Metcalf was fired.  Soon after, Kermit Davis, Jr. was hired prior to the 1990\u201391 season, after posting a 50\u201312 (.806) record in two seasons at Idaho.  He resigned after one season at 8\u201321 and Texas A&M began investigating recruiting violations by Davis. He was soon placed on a two-year probation by the NCAA and coached at a community college in Florida. Tony Barone was hired from Creighton in 1991 to replace Davis.  Barone lasted seven years as head coach of the program, finishing below .500 six times.  It was in 1994 that he finished with a 10\u20134 league record for 2nd place in the Southwest Conference and was invited to the NIT.  After Barone finished last in the Big 12 Conference in 1998, Melvin Watkins was hired out of UNC-Charlotte.  While a good recruiter, Watkins never finished above seventh in the Big 12.  He resigned after going winless (0\u201316) in conference play in 2004.\n\nSince 2004\nGillispie era\nAfter Watkins resigned, Billy Gillispie, was hired out of UTEP after leading the Miners to an NCAA tournament appearance and having the largest turnaround of any team in the nation, from 6\u201324 in 2002\u201303 to 24\u20138 in 2003\u201304.  The Aggies, though picked by Big 12 coaches to finish last in the conference, immediately improved under Gillispie, winning their first 10 games and finishing at 21\u201310, 8\u20138 in conference.  Along the way, the team defeated ranked, in-state rivals Texas and Texas Tech.  The team earned an NIT bid, Texas A&M's first postseason in 11 years, reaching the quarterfinals of the tournament.\nGillispie's second year featured further improvement, with the Aggies defeating three ranked opponents in Colorado, Texas, and Syracuse.  The team finished with a league record of 10\u20136 and a win in the Big 12 tournament, Texas A&M's first since the conference first began play in 1996\u201397.  The Aggies reached the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1987 as a 12-seed, upsetting fifth-seed Syracuse in the first round.  The Aggies fell in the second round to LSU on the final shot of the game.\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, A&M started ranked at #13. Despite early-season losses to LSU and UCLA, the Aggies were able to secure a win at Allen Fieldhouse over #6 Kansas, a first for a Big 12 South team since the conference was formed. They finished with just three losses in conference play (a sweep by Texas Tech and a double-overtime loss to a Kevin Durant-led Texas in Austin) and were able to secure the #2 seed in the Big 12 tournament. The Aggies lost in the quarterfinals to Oklahoma State. They received a #3 seed in the 2007 NCAA championship tournament, their highest seed ever, and reached the Sweet 16. In the postseason, A&M achieved a #9 ranking by the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today coaches polls, the highest ranking ever attained in school history. In this season, they were the only program in the Big 12 Conference to have both men's and women's teams competing in the NCAA Tournament \u2013 the men as a #3 seed and the women as a #4 seed.\nOn April 6, 2007, Gillispie resigned his position as head coach at Texas A&M to coach at the University of Kentucky. Four days later, on April 10, Mark Turgeon, head coach of Wichita State University, was announced as the new men's basketball head coach at A&M.\n\nTurgeon era\nUnder Turgeon and his staff from 2007 to 2011, the Aggies had their greatest four year win total in program history. The Aggies started the 2007\u201308 season ranked 14th in the preseason Coaches Poll. Once the season progressed, they won the 2007 NIT Season Tip-Off to extend their winning streak to 7\u20130. Their first loss of the season came to unranked Arizona. After the Arizona game, they would then win eight straight home games against unranked opponents. Team performance spiraled down once conference play had begun, losing to three straight unranked teams\u2014at Texas Tech, at Michael Beasley-led Kansas State, and at home to Baylor in a 5-overtime classic. The Aggies would post wins at their next five matchups, including one over the 10th-ranked rival Texas Longhorns and three away games. They then regressed, losing to Oklahoma State and Nebraska at home. Another high point came when they defeated Texas Tech 98\u201354 at home, matching their highest margin of victory in school history (set in 1959 against Texas). The Aggies regressed once again, this time losing 64\u201337 at Oklahoma. After the blowout, the Aggies were able to revenge Baylor in Waco, though came back home to lose their final regular season game to eventual national champion Kansas to finish the season at 8\u20138 in conference play. The team received a No. 6 bid to the Big 12 tournament, defeating Iowa State and Kansas State in the first two rounds, but lost to Kansas again in the semifinals. With their 24\u201310 record after the Big 12 tournament, the Aggies received a No. 9 at-large bid to the West Regional of the NCAA tournament. In the first round, they defeated 8th-seeded BYU 67\u201362 at Anaheim. In the second round, they faced UCLA at the same site, though allowed them to escape with a close 51\u201349 win. The Aggies finished the season with a 25\u201311 record. The 25 wins matches the record for most wins by a first-year coach at a Big 12 school, set by former Texas coach Tom Penders in the 1988\u201389 season.\nThe 2008\u201309 Aggies, led by Turgeon in his second year, went 14\u20131 in non-conference play, with wins over Alabama, Arizona, and LSU; the one loss was handed to them by Tulsa. Josh Carter and Bryan Davis received preseason Big 12 honorable mention. The team did not make the top 25 of the preseason AP or Coaches polls, though received votes. During the 2009 signing period, the Aggies signed Naji Hibbert, Khris Middleton, Kourtney Roberson, and Ray Turner, all of whom were listed in the Rivals.com Top 150 prospects for the class of 2009. The Aggies went 9\u20137 in Big 12 play to make the NCAA tournament for the fourth straight year; they defeated BYU in the first round for the second consecutive year before losing to UConn. Josh Carter became an All-Big 12 Third Team selection, while Derrick Roland was selected to the Big 12 All-Defensive Team. The Aggies finished 24\u201310, giving Turgeon 49 wins over two years.\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, the Aggies played a considerably tougher non-conference schedule, going 10\u20133. Senior guard Derrick Roland broke his leg grotesquely in December and missed the rest of the season. The team was picked to finish fifth in the Big 12 in the preseason coaches' poll but finished tied for second. With their 22\u20138 regular-season finish and 11\u20135 mark in conference play, the Aggies participated in the 2010 Big 12 Tournament and defeated Nebraska before losing to No. 1 Kansas in the semifinals. They received an at\u2013large bid to the NCAA tournament and earned a 5 seed in the South Region. They defeated 12 seed Utah State in the first round before falling to 4 seed Purdue in overtime in the second round to finish their season at 24\u201310. Donald Sloan made All-Big 12 First Team as a senior and Bryan Davis was named to the All-Big 12 Defensive team; they graduated with 100 wins, the most by any class in Aggie basketball history. Turgeon's 73 wins at the conclusion of the season surpassed Gillispie's 70 in three years at A&M.\nPrior to the beginning of his last year at Texas A&M, Turgeon had negotiated a contract extension and salary increase, but he was growing more unhappy with the Aggie fanbase. During his final season coaching the Aggies Turgeon publicly express unhappiness with the inconsistent fan support from both students and public ticket holders. On the evening of May 9, 2011 at 8pm (local time), Turgeon met with his coaching staff and players to inform them that half an hour earlier he accepted the head coach position at the University of Maryland. He had visited the campus earlier that day and left with an offer. When asked about his decision at an Aggie Athletics press conference he said \"Maryland's got a great basketball tradition. [Texas A&M and Maryland are] real similar. It's a gut feeling.\" In their meeting earlier that night he told the Aggie players \"it was the hardest decision [he] ever had to make... because of [them].\" Turgeon said that fan attendance at A&M did not factor into his decision.\n\nKennedy era\nFollowing the 2010 season, Mark Turgeon left the Texas Aggies for the University of Maryland, opening the door for Billy Kennedy to become the new head coach of the team. Kennedy, who arrived after coaching at Murray State, was known for his good coaching record for the Racers his final years there.\nKennedy's first three years at Texas A&M began as a slow progression in terms of quality of the teams, going 14-18, 18\u201315, and 18\u201316 respectively, with his 3rd year team being invited to the annual end-of-year CBI basketball tournament.\nThe 2014\u201315 season saw the Aggies vie for a spot in the NCAA tournament, but the team lost 4 of their last 5 games, so they were instead invited to the NIT. They finished the season with a record of 21\u201312.\nHis next year saw one of the best years in Aggie men's basketball in nearly a decade, with the team winning a share the conference regular season title. The Aggies were invited to the NCAA tournament as a 3 seed, and played all the way to the Sweet Sixteen, where they were eventually defeated by Oklahoma, finishing the season with a record of 28\u20139.\nThe next year was considered by many to be a rebuilding year, as 4 starting seniors were graduating, with 3 heading for the NBA: Danuel House, Alex Caruso, and Jalen Jones. The team, which was led by mostly sophomores, went on to finish the season with a record of 16\u201315, and were not invited to any postseason tournaments for the first time since 2013.\nThe following year, the Aggies returned most of their starters from the previous year, now as mostly juniors, and began the season with a lot of promise, landing a No. 25 spot in the preseason AP poll and reaching as high as No. 5 during the regular season. After a string of injuries and suspensions, the team hobbled to the end of the season, but not without landing a spot in the NCAA tournament. Earning a 7 seed, the team went on to defeat Providence and the defending national champions, North Carolina, to earn a spot in the Sweet Sixteen, their 2nd in 3 years. The team would lose to Michigan in the Sweet Sixteen, and finish the season with a record of 22\u201313. Sophomore starting center Robert Williams, as well as juniors Tyler Davis and D. J. Hogg would then declare for the NBA draft.\nThe next year was the worst year the Aggies had under Kennedy as head coach since his first one. The departure of 3 starters to the NBA draft as well as senior Admon Gilder to a season ending illness/injury before the season began did not bode well for the upcoming season. This was further stressed when the only returning starter from the previous season, TJ Starks, got a season-ending injury midway through conference play. With only 7 scholarship players left the Aggies fought hard with the addition of 2 walk-ons taking TJ's place- Mark French and Chris Collins. The Aggies finished the season 14\u201318. Kennedy was fired following the conclusion of the season.\n\nWilliams era\nFollowing Kennedy's firing by Scott Woodward, the Aggies hired Virginia Tech men's basketball coach Buzz Williams on April 3, 2019, following the Hokies loss to Duke in the Sweet 16 of the 2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The Aggies were picked to place 12th in the SEC preseason poll and began the season with a rough stretch, including losses to Temple and Fairfield. However, the team would eventually find its rhythm in its stifling defense, finishing the regular season with an overall record of 16\u201314, 10\u20138 in the SEC, the most wins since the 2016 Sweet Sixteen season and placing them in a tie for 6th in the conference. However, before any postseason play could begin, the season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020-21 season was marred by injury and illness, finishing with a record of 8\u201310, 2\u20138 in SEC play. The 2021-2022 season started with promise as A&M began SEC play 4-0 but hit a rough patch, losing 8 conference games in a row. However, the Aggies would catch fire late in the season, winning 8 of their final 9 games. A&M would enter the SEC Tournament, where they would upset #1 seed and SEC Regular Season Champions Auburn, and an Arkansas team that many considered one of the hottest teams in the country. The Aggies would lose to Tennessee in the tournament final, costing the team a spot in the NCAA tournament. They went on to play for the NIT championship where they lost to Xavier, 73-72.\nThe following few years would see both consistency and a lack thereof. The 2022\u201323 team finished the season with a record of 25\u201310, 15\u20133 in SEC play, the most conference wins in school history, but was given a lower seed in the NCAA tournament due to losses early in the season to teams such as Murray State and Wofford. They would go on to lose to Penn State in the first round of the tournament. The 2023\u201324 team had high hopes due to the strong season the prior year, but more inconsistency led to a season record of 21\u201314, 9\u20139 in SEC play, and, after defeating Nebraska in the first round, the season ended to a second round defeat in the NCAA tournament to Houston. The 2024\u201325 team, which would end up being Williams' last, played strong basketball throughout the season until the last few weeks where the team lost 6 of their last 9 games. A final record of 23\u201311, 11\u20137 in SEC play, a first-round victory against Yale in the NCAA tournament was all the team would attain before being defeated in the second round by Michigan. \nFollowing their defeat, Williams accepted the head coaching position at Maryland.\n\nMcMillan era\nOn April 4, 2025, it was announced that the Aggies had hired Samford Bulldogs men's basketball coach Bucky McMillan as the team's next head coach, replacing Buzz Williams. He quickly got into action, signing North Alabama's star guard Jacari Lane and Kansas' Zach Clements out of the transfer portal, attempting to rebuild a disbanded roster after Williams left the program for Maryland.\n\nTop 25 poll finishes\nThe AP Poll first appeared on January 20, 1949, and has since been published continuously. The Coaches' Poll began selecting the top 20 teams on a weekly basis during the 1950\u20131951 college basketball season. It was initially published by United Press from 1950 through 1990, followed by USA Today/CNN from 1991 through 1996, and USA Today/ESPN from 1997 through 2004, and USA Today from 2005 to the present. In the 1990\u20131991 basketball season the poll expanded to a top 25, and it has since retained this format.

  "Texas Longhorns": {
    "biography": "The Texas Longhorns men's basketball team represents the University of Texas at Austin in NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball competition. The Longhorns competed in the Big 12 Conference through the 2023\u201324 season and moved to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) on July 1, 2024.\nThe University of Texas began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1906. The Longhorns rank 15th in total victories among all NCAA Division I college basketball programs and 23rd in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 60 years in Division I, with an all-time win\u2013loss record of 1,920\u20131,158 (.624). Among Southeastern Conference men's basketball programs, Texas is second only to Kentucky in all-time wins and trails only Kentucky and Arkansas in all-time win percentage.\nAs of the end of the 2024\u201325 season, the Longhorns have won 29 total conference championships in men's basketball and have made 39 total appearances in the NCAA tournament (ninth-most appearances all time, with a 40\u201342 overall record), reaching the NCAA Final Four three times (1943, 1947, 2003) and the NCAA regional finals (Elite Eight) eight times. As of the end of the 2024\u201325 season, Texas ranks fourth among all Division I men's basketball programs for total NCAA Tournament games won without having won the national championship (40), tied with Kansas State and Notre Dame, and trailing Oklahoma (43), Illinois (46), and Purdue (51).\nThe Texas basketball program experienced substantial success during the early decades of its existence, but its success in the modern era is of relatively recent vintage. After two losing seasons during the program's first five years, Texas suffered only one losing season from 1912 to 1950, achieving a winning percentage of .703 during that span, reaching two Final Fours and one Elite Eight during the first decade of the NCAA Tournament, and receiving retroactive recognition as the 1933 national champion from the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. From 1951 to 1988, the Longhorns finished with losing records 14 times, recorded a winning percentage of .522, and participated in the expanded Tournament only five times. Texas achieved some measure of national recognition during the tenures of head coaches Abe Lemons (1976\u201382) and Tom Penders (1988\u201398), but the program rose to its highest level of prominence under the direction of former head coach Rick Barnes (1998\u20132015). Barnes guided Texas to 16 NCAA tournament appearances in his 17 seasons with the program, including a school-record 14 consecutive appearances (1999\u20132012), as well as fifteen 20-win seasons overall and a school-best 13 consecutive 20-win seasons (2000\u201312).\nTexas plays its home games in the Moody Center, which opened prior to the start of the 2022\u201323 season. The team is led by first-year head coach Sean Miller, formerly the head coach at Xavier and Arizona, who was hired on March 24, 2025, following the dismissal of former head coach Rodney Terry.\n\nHistory\nThe early years (1906\u201336)\n1906\u201313\nThe Texas men's basketball program began in 1906 under the direction of Scotland native Magnus Mainland, a graduate engineering student and lineman for the Texas football team who organized, coached, and played on the university's first varsity basketball team. Mainland had been a nationally known basketball player as an undergraduate student at Wheaton College (Illinois) prior to coming to UT. His Wheaton team placed second out of the three competing college basketball teams in the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, the first Olympic Games featuring the young sport (although only as a demonstration sport). Mainland was able to persuade the University Athletic Council to set aside $125 for the preparation of an outdoor basketball court on the southwest corner of Clark Field\u2014the stadium then hosting the Texas football, baseball, and track teams\u2014and to let him organize, coach, and play on the university's first varsity basketball team.\nThe Longhorns took the court for the first time on March 10, 1906, defeating the Baylor Bears 27\u201317 on their new outdoor home court at Clark Field. Texas traveled to Waco two weeks later for a three-game series with the Bears (also in their first year) and won all three games behind the play of Mainland. The Longhorns ultimately won seven of the eight games scheduled in the basketball program's inaugural season.\nDue to inadequate funding, the UT Athletic Council canceled the fledgling program after two seasons, leaving Texas without a basketball team for the 1908 season. The Athletics Council revived the program in 1909, owing in large part to the efforts of Longhorn player Morgan Vining, who campaigned to raise student interest in the game. Vining was supported in his efforts by the UT student newspaper, The Daily Texan, which consistently advocated for the reinstatement of basketball\u2014in part because the game was viewed as good physical training for football players in the latter sport's offseason. \n\nLanguage professor, German native, and Longhorn football head coach W. E. Metzenthin (1909\u201311), who had argued strongly against the cancellation of basketball at UT, assumed head coaching duties for three seasons following the re-establishment of the program. The Longhorns played just 10 of their 27 games under Metzenthin (and only four of their final 18) on their home court, outdoor Clark Field\u2014with its stubbornly uneven surface and total vulnerability to weather conditions\u2014being particularly ill-suited as a basketball venue. Metzenthin finished with an overall record of 13\u201314; not until 1959 would another UT basketball coach leave with a losing overall record. After Metzenthin relinquished coaching duties following the 1911 season in order to serve as UT Athletic Council chairman (precursor to the athletic director position), former Texas track coach J. Burton Rix\u2014coaching without financial compensation, just as had his two predecessors\u2014led Texas to a 5\u20131 record in his single season as head coach (1912).\nProfessor Carl C. Taylor, also the Texas track coach, assumed basketball head coaching responsibilities for the 1913 season. Taylor arranged for the rental of the theater of the Ben Hur Temple and its conversion into a miniature basketball court and arena so that his team would have an indoor venue for home games and practice, with UT paying the Shriners and Scottish Rite Freemasons a sum of $75 for the season. Taylor came to UT with a strong reputation for basketball expertise, acquired during his years at Drake University. His Texas team finished with an overall record of 8\u20134 and, beginning with a 70\u20137 rout of Southwestern in San Marcos, contributed the first three victories to what would become a national-record winning streak. At the conclusion of the 1912\u201313 academic year, the UT's Cactus yearbook declared, \"Basketball is no longer a minor sport at the University of Texas. It always has been so considered until this year Prof. Carl Taylor took charge of the work and infused new life into it.\"\n\n1914\u201327\nL. Theo Bellmont, the first athletic director at The University of Texas\u2014and a man instrumental in the formation of the Southwest Conference\u2014took the reins as head coach from 1914 to 1915, for the first of his two stints leading the basketball team, and directed the Longhorns to 11\u20130 and 14\u20130 records in the 1914 and 1915 seasons, respectively, as well as the inaugural Southwest Conference championship during the latter season. Bellmont's teams contributed 25 victories to a winning streak that would ultimately grow to 44 games.\nAfter his teams extended the UT winning streak to 28 games, Bellmont stepped away from coaching to focus on his work as athletic director and appointed Roy Henderson to the still-unpaid Texas basketball head coaching position. Henderson's team recorded Texas' third consecutive undefeated season in 1916 to extend the total to 40 consecutive victories. Senior center Clyde Littlefield, the linchpin of the three consecutive undefeated teams\u2014and a towering figure in UT athletics history who would later coach the football team for seven seasons (1927\u201333), serve as the head coach of the UT track team from 1925 to 1960 (winning 25 conference championships), and found the Texas Relays\u2014would later receive retroactive recognition as Texas' first consensus All-American in basketball for his play in the 1916 season.\nUT alumnus and former regent Thomas Watt Gregory had begun campaigning a decade earlier for the construction of a permanent gymnasium for the benefit of the student body and faculty\u2014one in which the basketball team would be able to play and practice as well\u2014but fundraising for the $75,000 project had lagged, even more so with Gregory's departure from Austin to serve as the U.S. Attorney General under Woodrow Wilson in 1914. The project was shelved, but the need remained acute, and, following the 1916 season, the UT Athletic Council decided to allocate $8,500 for the construction of the temporary and rudimentary all-wood Men's Gym, which was finished for the second game of the next season.\n\n \nTheo Bellmont hired Eugene Van Gent from Missouri in 1916 to lead the Texas football, basketball, and track programs. Van Gent's single basketball team at Texas recorded a 13\u20133 overall mark and won the Southwest Conference championship for the third consecutive year, with the season highlighted by the first-ever basketball games between Texas and the Texas A&M Aggies, following the resumption of athletic relations between the two schools. The Longhorns began the basketball rivalry with wins in both home games and in one of two games in College Station. Van Gent's 1917 Texas team also added the final four wins to the Texas winning streak that had begun in 1913 before suffering a 24\u201318 loss to Rice in Austin. Texas' winning streak stood as the NCAA record for consecutive wins in men's basketball for almost 40 years (until Phil Woolpert's Bill Russell-led San Francisco teams won 60 consecutive games from 1955 to 1957), and the achievement today remains the fifth-longest winning streak in Division I history. Van Gent departed after coaching for one season in each sport\u2014winning the conference championship in both\u2014to join the military following the United States' entry into the First World War in April 1917.\nFollowing Van Gent's single year as head coach, Roy Henderson returned to coach Texas for two additional seasons. With several players from the 1917 team having left for military service, the 1918 Longhorn basketball team had only one returning player in sophomore Al DeViney. Henderson scouted talent in the intramural ranks and nonetheless assembled a team that finished 14\u20135 overall and missed winning Texas' fourth consecutive SWC championship by a single game. Henderson guided the Longhorns to a 17\u20133 overall record in his final season (1919), splitting the four-game series with the second-place Aggies to win the SWC championship\u2014Texas' fourth basketball conference championship during the five years the conference had existed.\n\n \nFrom 1910 through 1919, Texas recorded an overall winning percentage of .789. Only three NCAA schools\u2014California, Navy, and Wisconsin\u2014achieved higher winning percentages for that decade.\nEugene Van Gent was set to return as head coach for the 1920 season but resigned before the beginning of the season to pursue a business opportunity in California. Berry M. Whitaker\u2014who had come to the university to develop and direct one of the nation's first intramural programs, and who would also coach the Texas football team for the next three seasons\u2014agreed to serve as head coach for the season. Texas, with seven returning lettermen and war veterans who had played in 1916 and 1917, was once again expected to contend for the conference championship in 1920, but seven players missed significant parts of the season due to injury and illness. After winning their first five games, the Longhorns lost six of eleven to finish at 10\u20136 overall\u2014Texas' worst season in nine years.\nTheo Bellmont designated Whitaker as the Longhorn football head coach after the departure of Bill Juneau, and Bellmont himself would assume basketball head coaching duties for two more seasons (1921 and 1922), finishing with a 13\u20135 overall record in 1921. Bellmont then led Texas to its first 20-win season during his final year. The Longhorns finished 20\u20134 overall and 14\u20134 in conference play in 1922. Missing five players to injury and grades in the latter part of the season, including the SWC's leading scorer in Phillip Peyton, Texas nonetheless entered its final game with a chance to win the SWC championship for the first time since 1919. The Longhorns fell short in College Station against the Aggies, then coached by future Texas football head coach and Athletic Director Dana X. Bible, who claimed their third consecutive SWC championship. Bellmont returned to his administrative responsibilities for good following the 1922 season, finishing his basketball coaching career with a 58\u20139 overall record; his .866 winning percentage remains the highest of any coach in program history.\nBellmont selected football assistant coach Milton Romney as the next head basketball coach\u2014then still an unpaid position. Romney's tenure took an early inauspicious turn when the Longhorns lost at home to Oklahoma A&M, 28\u201327, after Romney called his top players to the bench with a 14-point lead and nine minutes remaining. The Longhorns again suffered a disproportionate number of injuries, including the loss of two starters to a broken leg and a fractured skull resulting from a motorcycle accident. The protracted selection of E. J. \"Doc\" Stewart from Clemson University as the head football coach created further turmoil and distraction when newspapers reported that he would also be charged with leading the basketball team, thus rendering Romney a lame duck with seven games to play. Texas stumbled to an 11\u20137 finish, losing four of its final six games, but managing to close the season with a win over Bible's Aggies.\n\nA medical school graduate, a piano enthusiast, a former sportswriter, a one-time automobile dealership owner, and a veteran football and basketball coach, Doc Stewart quickly became a popular figure across diverse segments of the university population. His oratory eloquence landed him an open job offer from the head of the UT English Department. After having coached the football team to an undefeated season, Stewart turned to implementing an entirely new style of basketball at Texas\u2014one that emphasized ball movement and man-to-man defense and that essentially dispensed with the dribble altogether. Texas entered the season expected to finish third or fourth in conference play behind TCU, Oklahoma A&M, and possibly Texas A&M. Texas opened the season with a one-point win and two four-point wins over Southwestern\u2014an opponent that had lost its previous six games against the Longhorns by an average of almost 20 points\u2014leading to concern in the local newspapers. Contrary to prognostications, Texas opened the conference slate with two wins over Oklahoma A&M and sweeps of six other conference series to reach 14\u20130 in conference play, securing at least a share of the SWC championship with six games remaining, all away from Austin. The Longhorns next traveled more than 500 miles by train to open a long and bitter basketball rivalry with the Arkansas Razorbacks, then in their first year of competition in the sport, earning four- and 11-point wins in Fayetteville. Despite its unblemished record, Texas was still predicted to lose at least one game to the Aggies in College Station. The Longhorns instead managed 24\u201314 and 17\u201311 victories over the Aggies to finish as the last undefeated team in Texas and SWC history at 23\u20130. Senior guard Abb Curtis would later receive retroactive recognition for the 1924 season as UT's second-ever consensus first-team All-American in basketball.\n\nSome have speculated that Stewart's devotion to his varied non-athletic interests was the root cause of his football and basketball teams' decline in performance over his tenure. Following the perfect 1924 season, Stewart's next three teams finished 17\u20138, 12\u201310, and 13\u20139. This slide\u2014coupled with his football teams' similar decline in performance\u2014resulted in the popular Stewart's controversial dismissal following the 1926\u201327 season.\n\n1927\u201336\nExcepting two strong seasons\u2014one particularly noteworthy\u2014Texas maintained this level of relatively unremarkable performance in basketball for the better part of the next decade. Texas won only a single SWC Championship during the next nine seasons\u2014in the exceptional 22\u20131 season of 1932\u201333, for which the Longhorns were also retroactively awarded the Premo-Porretta Power Poll national championship (presently unclaimed by UT).\n\nFred Walker (1927\u201331) coached the Longhorns following E.J. Stewart's dismissal, producing a 51\u201330 combined record during his four-year stint as head coach. Walker led Texas to an 18\u20132 overall record and 10\u20132 conference record during his second season. He was terminated following the Longhorns' disappointing 9\u201315 season in his fourth year.\nEd Olle (1931\u201334), who had played for Texas under Stewart, coached Texas for three seasons after Walker's dismissal, leading the Longhorns to a 22\u20131 overall mark, a conference championship, and a retroactively awarded Premo-Porretta Power Poll national championship during his second year. During his third year, Olle signaled that he would resign at the end of the season and recommended that freshman team and assistant varsity coach Marty Karow take his place.\nKarow (1934\u201336) would direct Texas to a combined 31\u201316 record over his two years as head coach. His relationship with Texas Athletic Director and Longhorn football head coach Jack Chevigny marked by increasing friction, Karow resigned as head coach in the summer of 1936 and was hired shortly thereafter as the baseball head coach for the United States Naval Academy.\n\nJack Gray & H. C. \"Bully\" Gilstrap era (1937\u201351)\nPre-war Jack Gray years (1937\u201342)\nOnly two seasons removed from his senior year at Texas, in which he earned consensus first-team All-American honors, and with only one year as an assistant coach with the Texas freshman team, the immensely popular Jack Gray was hired as the fourteenth Texas men's basketball head coach in the summer of 1937 at the age of 25.\nAfter his first two teams combined for a 24\u201321 record, Gray's 1938\u201339 team posted a 19\u20136 overall mark and won the Southwest Conference championship outright for UT's first basketball conference title in six years. The season featured the then-most anticipated intersectional matchup in school history, as Phog Allen's Kansas Jayhawks came to Austin. The Jayhawks appeared to be on their way to winning the first game until the Longhorns rallied late in the second half for a 36\u201334 victory. The second game the following night proceeded more in line with expectations, with Kansas winning handily, 49\u201335. Following the series against KU, Texas traveled to Oklahoma City to compete for the first time in the All-College tournament, which had begun in 1937. The 1939 edition of the holiday tournament featured 32 teams from the Southwest and Midwest. The Longhorns easily advanced through their tournament bracket, defeating Southeastern State College (Oklahoma), Westminster College (Missouri), Kansas State Teachers College, and tournament favorite Baylor before falling to Central Missouri State Teachers College in the championship game, 33\u201325. Texas began conference play with an upset loss to the Rice Owls before hosting the Arkansas Razorbacks for two games in Austin. The Longhorns won a close first contest, 41\u201337, before being thoroughly outclassed in the second, falling 65\u201341. With Texas reeling\u2014having started 1\u20132 in SWC play, and hosting no conference games in Austin for the next month\u2014the team's goal of ending the conference championship drought was in peril. The Longhorns began a four-game stretch of conference road games with a win over Baylor in Waco before continuing to Dallas to face the SMU Mustangs, who stood at 5\u20130 in conference play. Gray praised the Mustangs as \"probably the most powerful team in the history of the school,\" and SMU coach Whitey Baccus confidently announced that his team would dispatch the Longhorns. Instead, Texas handed SMU its first defeat of the conference season, 33\u201327. The Longhorns defeated the TCU Horned Frogs and the Texas A&M Aggies in their remaining two conference road games before winning all five SWC contests in Austin, concluding with a 66\u201332 rout of the Aggies. With a nine-game conference winning streak, Texas had finished at 10\u20132 in SWC play to claim sole possession of the SWC championship. The Longhorns were one of eight teams to qualify for the inaugural postseason NCAA tournament, where they fell 56\u201341 to the \"Tall Firs\" of the Oregon Webfoots (later known as the Ducks), the eventual NCAA champion. Texas lost the West Regional third-place game to Utah State, 51\u201349.\n\nHopes and expectations for the 1939\u201340 team were high, as all but one of the key players returned from the previous season's SWC champion and NCAA Tournament squad. Texas opened the season with seven wins by an average of 18 points (and by no fewer than 11), including two wins over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a home series that marked the first meetings between the two schools in basketball. Gray was intent both upon raising national recognition of the program and upon toughening his team in the early part of the season for the conference slate ahead, and to both ends he sought to involve the Longhorns in intersectional competition against prominent teams in high-profile venues across the country. Ned Irish, director of Madison Square Garden and a pioneer in the promotion of college basketball in the 1930s, had invited Gray's Longhorns to play Manhattan College as part of a doubleheader that included Southern California and Long Island University. The UT Athletic Council agreed to fund the team's trip to New York for the contest, followed by a stop in Philadelphia to play Temple. In front of 18,425 fans, the Longhorns overwhelmed Manhattan by a score of 54\u201332, earning the praise of the New York sports media and basketball fans for their speed and the accuracy of their one-handed shooting, which Gray had popularized as a player and continued teaching as a coach. Continuing on to Philadelphia, Texas fell 47\u201337 to Temple, winners of the first National Invitation Tournament two years prior. Having lost one of two road contests against Arkansas and a road game against SMU in overtime, Texas entered the penultimate game of the season at 18\u20133 and tied at 8\u20132 in conference play with the preseason conference favorite Rice Owls\u2014a team that the Longhorns had defeated on Rice's home court earlier in the season, 50\u201346. In front of a raucous pro-Texas crowd of more than 8,000 fans packed into Gregory Gymnasium, the Longhorns suffered a one-point loss to the Owls, 42\u201341, to see their hopes of winning a second consecutive outright SWC championship dashed and their chances of even sharing the championship greatly diminished. Another painful defeat followed in the final game of the season, as the Longhorns fell to a 10\u201311 Texas A&M team in College Station, 53\u201352, on a long running shot from the Aggies' backup center in the final seconds. Texas finished 18\u20135 with no invitation to a postseason tournament. The Premo-Porretta Power Poll retroactively assigned the 1939\u201340 Longhorn team a national ranking of No. 17.\nAfter his next two teams combined for a 28\u201319 overall record and a 12\u201312 record in conference play, Gray was notified of his acceptance for duty in the Navy in April 1942, four months after the United States had entered the Second World War. Gray's assistant Ed Price had also left for naval service. Longhorn football assistant coach Howard \"Bully\" Gilstrap was appointed to coach the team for the duration of the war.\n\nGilstrap as interim head coach (1942\u201345)\nIn addition to both coaches, three starters from the 1941\u201342 team had departed for service in the war. Accordingly, expectations for the 1942\u201343 Longhorns were low. Despite losses of coaches and players that were projected as insurmountable hardships, Texas defied expectations, winning 13 of its first 16 games. Gilstrap credited Gray and Price with encouragement and advice from afar and his players with a degree of cooperation he said he had not seen before. Gilstrap explained, \"There were a lot of things I didn't know about the system, and the boys realized that. They came to the rescue. They've been assistant coaches as well as players. We've just been trying to work it out together.\" After stumbling on a swing through North Texas late in the season with losses to TCU and SMU, the Longhorns concluded the regular season with victories over the Baylor Bears and Texas A&M to win a share of the SWC championship and qualify for the NCAA tournament for the second time. The Longhorns drew the Tournament co-favorite Washington Huskies for their first game. After falling behind by 13 points in the first half, Texas came back to win 59\u201355 behind 30 points from John Hargis and 15 from Buck Overall to advance to its first-ever Final Four, where it drew the other Tournament co-favorite, the Wyoming Cowboys. It was then the Longhorns who surrendered an early 13-point lead, as the bigger and stronger Cowboys regrouped to win 58\u201354, on their way to defeating the Georgetown Hoyas 46\u201334 for the NCAA championship. Texas finished the season with a 19\u20137 overall record.\nFollowing the 1943\u201344 and 1944\u201345 seasons, in which Gilstrap's Longhorn teams posted overall records of 14\u201311 and 10\u201310, respectively, Jack Gray returned as head coach with the end of the Pacific War in August 1945.\n\nPost-war Jack Gray years (1945\u201351)\nGray took charge of a 1945\u201346 Texas team that returned only five lettermen\u2014none of whom had ever played under him\u2014and which had very little size, as both forward John Hargis and Robert Summers would be out for the entire season. Little was expected of the Longhorns that season, but Texas managed to win its first seven games. The team's grave liabilities in defense and rebounding against bigger teams were never more evident that year than against defending\u2014and soon-to-be-repeating\u2014national champion Oklahoma A&M (later renamed Oklahoma State University) and its 7'0\" All-American center, Bob \"Foothills\" Kurland. Kurland and the Aggies (later known as the Cowboys) dominated the diminutive Longhorns from start to finish, winning 69\u201334 in the opening round of the eight-team All-College tournament in Oklahoma City. The Longhorns dropped the second game of the tournament to fellow SWC member Rice, 55\u201352. The Longhorns opened a new season of SWC play with a road win over TCU. Texas was not expected to fare significantly better in two consecutive games against the towering Arkansas Razorbacks in Fayetteville than it had against Oklahoma A&M. The Longhorns acquitted themselves well in a close loss in the first game, 55\u201347, but the pre-game prognostications came to fruition the following night, as Arkansas routed Texas 90\u201363 in the second contest. After having lost four of five games, Texas posted an 8\u20133 record in its final 11 contests to finish with a respectable mark of 16\u20137 and a third-place conference finish, significantly exceeding preseason expectations for the undersized 1945\u201346 team.\nDiscussions had begun about the projected need to build a larger arena for UT basketball team. Longhorn basketball had grown significantly in popularity under Gray and Gilstrap's guidance. Sellouts had not been particularly common during the war years, but the university was growing rapidly, and if Texas basketball continued to achieve success, a looming capacity problem was clearly foreseeable. Football and basketball were growing in popularity nationwide, and a spending and building boom was expected to take place in athletics departments around the country. No specific plans for basketball took shape at UT, but discussions of a larger gym or arena continued over the next three years.\nReturning all but one top player and adding some military veterans and players from the freshman team, Gray's 1946\u201347 Texas team was thought to have a legitimate chance of winning the SWC championship, along with Arkansas, SMU, and defending SWC champion Baylor. Future Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame member and five-time NBA champion guard Slater Martin and forward John Hargis returned to the team to join guards Roy Cox and Al Madsen, who had returned the previous season. All four men, along with three other of that year's letterwinners, had served in the war. Martin, Cox, and Madsen were dubbed the \"Mighty Mice.\" Though the return of Hargis helped, the Longhorns were again a team not possessed of great size, but they did possess great speed and scoring ability. The Longhorns began the season with four blowout wins, the last and closest coming by a score of 46\u201334 against the Continental Air Liners of Denver. The game against the Air Liners was the last game Texas would play against a semi-professional team, once a routine component of the nonconference schedule, until the 1955\u201356 season. Not content to play only overmatched local teams for the remainder of the nonconference slate, Gray wanted to harden his team for the season ahead, and the Longhorns next embarked upon a 10-day, 4,000-mile train trip to face Canisius in Buffalo, Long Island in New York City, and DePaul in Chicago. Texas defeated Canisius 52\u201346 before traveling to New York for the most-anticipated contest of the trip, the game in Madison Square Garden against Clair Bee's LIU Blackbirds, who were averaging 90 points per game and had recently defeated defending national champion Oklahoma A&M. In front of a strongly pro-LIU crowd of 18,453, the Longhorns upset the Blackbirds, 47\u201346. Texas next traveled to Chicago to face the DePaul Blue Demons of Ray Meyer, whose team had won the NIT two years earlier, and won the final game of their road trip in a rout, 61\u201343. Before returning to Austin, the 7\u20130 Longhorns stopped in Oklahoma City to play in the All-College Tournament. Texas dominated the Missouri Tigers 65\u201346 before falling to Oklahoma A&M, the two-time defending national champion, in the semifinal by a single point, 40\u201339. The Longhorns defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in the third-place game the following night by a score of 62\u201350. Texas was only occasionally challenged during the remainder of the regular season, winning its three remaining nonconference games by 29, 24, and 12 points and seven of its first 10 conference games by 12 or more points (and the first 10 SWC contests by an average of 16.6 points). The Longhorns entered the final weekend of the conference season needing only one win in two games against the second-place Razorbacks. In front of more than 8,000 fans at Gregory Gym, Arkansas led for most of the first game before Slater Martin led a late surge to secure the win and the outright conference championship for Texas, 49\u201344. The pressure to win the SWC championship thus relieved, the Longhorns easily dispatched the Razorbacks the following night, 66\u201346, to finish the regular season 24\u20131 overall and 12\u20130 in SWC play for their first undefeated conference season since Doc Stewart's 1923\u201324 team finished 23\u20130. Texas traveled to Kansas City to face Wyoming in the first game of the NCAA tournament. Four players from each team had been on the 1943 teams that faced off in the Final Four on Wyoming's way to the NCAA championship. Texas trailed until the final minutes of the second matchup, and Martin's long shot with 35 seconds remaining provided the margin of victory, with the Longhorns winning 42\u201340 to advance to the Final Four for the second time, where they would face Oklahoma. Despite having defeated the Sooners earlier in the season by 12 points, the Longhorns trailed 53\u201349 in the final minute of their second contest. Texas scored five points to take a 54\u201353 lead with seconds remaining, but OU scored on a 40-foot shot as time expired to defeat the Longhorns, 55\u201354. Texas returned to Madison Square Garden to play the City College of New York in the national third-place game prior to the NCAA championship game between OU and Holy Cross (won by the Crusaders, 58\u201347). Texas defeated CCNY 54\u201350 to finish the season with 26 wins and two last-second, one-point defeats.\nWith demand for tickets outstripping the seating capacity of Gregory Gym, calls began to grow louder for the construction of a new arena. At the same time, a group of Austin businessmen announced plans for the construction of a 10,000-seat arena adjacent to soon-to-be-built Interregional Highway, the precursor to Interstate 35, and 23rd Street and East Avenue\u2014plans which ultimately did not bear fruit. During the following season, members of the UT Development Board met with several dozen prominent alumni to discuss plans for the construction of a 20,000-seat coliseum, at a cost of roughly $2 million, to be located south of Memorial Stadium. UT architects had already begun to draw up designs for such an arena, but the effort did not progress beyond the planning stages.\n\nSlater Martin and Al Madsen returned to the 1947\u201348 Longhorn team, among others, but this team was short on depth compared to the previous season's Final Four team, with only seven players in Gray's rotation. For the first time in six years, freshmen were barred from playing on the varsity team. Texas started the season 6\u20130\u2014highlighted by a 51\u201342 win over the Texas Tech Red Raiders and a 51\u201330 blowout of the LSU Tigers, who proved too slow to handle the speed of another fast and quick Longhorn team\u2014before embarking on another road trip to the Northeast, stopping in New York for the third time in two seasons. In a rematch of the previous season's national third-place game, Texas faced the CCNY Beavers in Madison Square Garden. Texas surrendered an 18-point first-half lead but withstood a late CCNY rally, holding on to win, 61\u201359. Texas defeated the St. Joseph's Hawks in Philadelphia, 61\u201357, before returning to Oklahoma City for the All-College Tournament. There the Longhorns defeated the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets by a score of 54\u201345 and the Alabama Crimson Tide, 40\u201331, to advance to the title game against Oklahoma A&M. For the second consecutive year, the Aggies defeated the Longhorns by a single point, 32\u201331, after Bob Harris again provided the winning margin in the final five seconds. Texas opened conference play 5\u20130, pushing its overall record to 16\u20131, before suffering three consecutive losses to Baylor, Rice, and Arkansas to see its prospects for defending its SWC crown dashed. The Longhorns recovered to win the second game against the Razorbacks in their weekend trip to Fayetteville, 54\u201343, to halt the losing streak. By the time of the Longhorns' next contest, against Baylor, the Bears stood at 11\u20130 in conference play and had already secured the SWC championship. Although Texas could do no better than second place, more than 8,000 fans squeezed into 7,500-seat Gregory Gym to see the Longhorns hand the Bears their only defeat of the conference season, 32\u201329, after Al Madsen added a layup and a free throw in the final 20 seconds. The win over Baylor landed Texas an invitation to the 1948 NIT with two conference games remaining. (Baylor would go on to advance to the championship game of the 1948 NCAA tournament, where the Bears fell to Adolph Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats in the first NCAA championship game appearance for either program.) Texas narrowly avoided an upset loss to SMU at home before blowing out Texas A&M in College Station, 54\u201334, to finish 9\u20133 and in second place in the SWC play. The Longhorns boarded a train for New York the following morning to face the favored Violets of New York University, led by future fourth overall 1948 draft pick, 16-year NBA star, and Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame member Dolph Schayes. Martin and Madsen led Texas to a 43\u201339 lead with under four minutes remaining\u2014after Texas had trailed by seven points midway through the second half\u2014but NYU tied the game in the final minute and scored the final basket on a long shot with six seconds remaining to win the quarterfinals game, 45\u201343. The Longhorns finished the season 20\u20135, marking the first time in program history that Texas had won 20 or more games in consecutive seasons.\n\nTexas recedes from the national stage (1951\u201376)\nAfter two losing seasons during the program's first five years, Texas suffered only one losing season from 1912 to 1950, reaching two Final Fours and one Elite Eight during the first decade of the NCAA Tournament. The Longhorns would finish with losing records ten times from 1951 to 1976.\n\nAbrupt decline (1951\u201359)\nThurman \"Slue\" Hull was hired as men's basketball head coach prior to the 1951\u201352 season. In his five seasons as the Texas head coach, Hull led the Longhorns to one Southwest Conference championship (1953\u201354) and finished with an overall record of 60\u201358 (.508). He was dismissed following the 1955\u201356 season after his final two teams produced a combined record of 16\u201332\u2014easily the worst two-year period in the history of Longhorn basketball to that point. Hull was the first Texas coach since W. E. Metzenthin, who coached the basketball team for three years during the program's first five seasons (1909\u201311), to finish with a Texas career win percentage below .600.\nFollowing Hull's dismissal, Marshall Hughes was hired as the next men's basketball head coach prior to the 1956\u201357 season. Under Hughes, the Texas basketball program reached the nadir of its existence. Hughes was fired after only three seasons\u2014each with a losing record, and each worse than the one preceding it\u2014with an overall record of 25\u201346 (.352) after his final team posted a mark of just 4\u201320, tying the 1954\u201355 season as the then-worst in program history and concluding a five-year span of futility in which the Longhorns produced an overall record of 41\u201378 (.345).\n\nUneven recovery (1959\u201367)\nBetween coaches Harold Bradley, hired as head coach in 1959, and Leon Black, who directed the basketball team from 1967 to 1976, the Longhorns played in four NCAA Tournaments, two under each coach, as a result of winning the Southwest Conference five times (three times outright) in 17 years.\nIn Bradley's first season, the Longhorns won the SWC outright to reach the 1960 NCAA tournament, where they fell to the Kansas Jayhawks by a score of 80\u201371 in the Sweet Sixteen contest. Texas subsequently lost the Midwest Regional third-place game to DePaul by a score of 67\u201361. Texas finished the season ranked No. 13 in the UPI Coaches Poll, marking the first time that the basketball team had finished the season ranked since the introduction of the AP poll and the Coaches Poll for the 1948\u201349 and 1950\u201351 seasons, respectively.\nBradley's 1962\u201363 team again won the SWC outright and reached 20 wins for the first time since Jack Gray's 1947\u201348 Longhorns. Texas advanced to the NCAA tournament and defeated the Texas Western Miners by a score of 65\u201347 in its opening game to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where the Longhorns fell 73\u201368 to Ed Jucker's defending two-time national champion and fifth-consecutive Final Four participant Cincinnati Bearcats. Texas would go on to win the Midwest Regional third-place game against future Texas head coach Abe Lemons' Oklahoma City Chiefs by a score of 90\u201381. The Longhorns finished the season ranked No. 12 in the Coaches Poll.\nThe 1964\u201365 Longhorns tied SMU for the conference championship but lost the tiebreaker for the conference's NCAA tournament berth and thus did not participate in postseason play. In the following two seasons, Bradley's Texas teams posted overall records of 12\u201312 and 14\u201310. Bradley retired following the 1966\u201367 season. He finished with an overall record of 123\u201375 (.631) and a conference record of 73\u201339 (.651) as Texas head coach.\n\nResumed decline (1967\u201376)\nWith the hiring of Leon Black prior to the 1967\u201368 season, Texas entered a period that saw the reversal of most of its progress since the lost decade of the 1950s. Black opened with three losing seasons and one non-winning season before his 1971\u201372 team finished 19\u20139, won a share of the conference championship, and reached the 1972 NCAA tournament. The Longhorns defeated the Houston Cougars (who had been approved for SWC membership in 1971, but did not play a conference basketball schedule until 1975\u201376) 85\u201374 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where they fell to the Kansas State Wildcats by a score of 66\u201355. Texas also lost the regional third place game 100\u201370 to Southwestern Louisiana (now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, branded \"Louisiana\" for intercollegiate athletics), but that game, plus all Ragin' Cajun tournament games in 1972 and 1973, were scrubbed from NCAA records when USL was handed a two-year death penalty in August 1973 (the game vs. USL was not a forfeit win for Texas).\nAfter posting a 13\u201312 overall record in 1972\u201373, Black's Longhorns recorded three consecutive losing seasons, each with fewer wins and more defeats than the one before. Black's 1973\u201374 team managed to win the SWC championship outright, even with an overall record of 12\u201315, and advanced to the NCAA tournament, where the Longhorns fell to the Creighton Bluejays in the first round, 77\u201361.\nFollowing 10\u201315 and 9\u201317 seasons in 1974\u201375 and 1975\u201376, respectively, Black resigned from his position as Texas head coach. Black finished with an overall record of 106\u2013121 (.467) and a record of 63\u201365 (.492) in conference play. Prior to Black, only two Texas head coaches had finished with overall losing records\u2014W. E. Metzenthin (1909\u201311) and Marshall Hughes (1956\u201359)\u2014and each had only coached for three seasons. Black coached for nine seasons, only twice finishing with a winning record.\n\nAbe Lemons years (1976\u201382)\nFollowing Leon Black's resignation, Texas Athletic Director and Longhorn head football coach Darrell Royal selected then-University of Texas-Pan American and former longtime Oklahoma City University head coach Abe Lemons as his primary target for the open position. Lemons and fellow Oklahoman Royal agreed to a five-year contract worth roughly $30,000 per year, and Lemons was subsequently introduced as the twentieth Longhorn head basketball coach in the program's 72 seasons.\nThanks to his exuberant personality, quick and acerbic wit, and rare quote-making skill, the cigar-smoking Abe Lemons' growing status as a fan favorite anticipated any of his notable accomplishments in basketball at Texas. Though he and his staff inherited two players that would play central roles on his most successful Texas teams in freshman forward and Los Angeles high school player of the year Ron Baxter and sophomore Auburn transfer Jim Krivacs, Lemons was nevertheless assuming control of a moribund program coming off of three consecutive losing seasons, the last of which featured the then-third-most defeats in the history of the program. Lemons was less than sanguine about the Longhorns' prospects for the 1976\u201377 season. Asked in a preseason media session if he felt his first Texas team to be worthy of a top-twenty ranking, Lemons replied, \"You mean in the state?\" After starting the season with a 6\u20139 record, Texas managed a six-game winning streak against some of the conference's weaker teams before stumbling to a 1\u20134 finish over the final five games. Despite Lemons' dejected mood following the final game of the season, a loss to Baylor in the final men's basketball game in Gregory Gymnasium, his first team had posted a four-game improvement in its season record over the 9\u201317 squad of the prior year, finishing 13\u201313 on the season.\nNo significant preseason expectations attended the 1977\u201378 Texas Longhorns, a team that would produce one of the more successful seasons in Longhorn basketball history. After a one-point loss in the opening game against Southern California in Los Angeles, Texas inaugurated the $37-million, 16,231-seat Special Events Center with an 83\u201376 victory over the Oklahoma Sooners, the first of eight straight wins. Texas lost 65\u201356 to fifth-ranked, defending national champion Marquette before posting another nine straight victories, including a 75\u201369 upset of third-ranked and eventual Final Four participant Arkansas, with its famed \"Triplets\" (guards Sidney Moncrief, Ron Brewer, and Marvin Delph). The win over Eddie Sutton's Razorbacks vaulted Lemons' Longhorns to a No. 15 ranking in the Associated Press Poll, Texas' first appearance in the poll since a one-week showing at No. 20 in 1949, the inaugural season of the AP basketball poll. Texas would finish the regular season ranked No. 12 in the AP poll with records of 22\u20134 overall and 14\u20132 in conference play, sharing the Southwest Conference Championship with the Razorbacks. Despite the impressive season, Texas saw its hopes of playing in the 32-team NCAA tournament dashed in a two-point loss to Houston in the SWC Tournament Final. Houston claimed the automatic bid to the Tournament, Arkansas received an at-large bid, and the Longhorns were left to accept a bid to the 1978 National Invitation Tournament. Texas would storm through the tournament to reach the NIT Championship Game against the North Carolina State Wolfpack, defeating Temple, Nebraska, and Rutgers by an average of over 17 points in the first three rounds. The Longhorns posted an easy 101\u201393 victory over the Wolfpack to win the NIT Championship behind 22, 26, and 33 points, respectively, from point guard Johnny Moore and 1978 NIT Co-MVPs Ron Baxter and Jim Krivacs. After the end of the 1977\u201378 season, Abe Lemons was named National Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Lemons remains the only men's basketball coach in UT history to earn National Coach of the Year honors.\nWith its four leading scorers returning, Texas entered the 1978\u201379 season with a No. 6 ranking in the AP poll and as the near-unanimous favorite to win the SWC championship. The Longhorns struggled early, beginning the season 7\u20134 and falling out of the AP rankings after a 21-point road defeat to Bill Cartwright and the San Francisco Dons. After another blowout road loss to Texas Tech, Texas regrouped to win three straight road games and 12 of its next 13 games, including a three-point upset of 10th-ranked Arkansas in Fayetteville, a 23-point blowout of Shelby Metcalf's No. 15 Texas A&M Aggies in Austin, and an eight-point win over the 11th-ranked Aggies three weeks later in College Station. During the preceding thirty seasons, Texas had only managed a total of six wins against AP-ranked opponents, and never more than one such victory in a single year. A home loss to 14th-ranked Arkansas was the lone blemish during the 13-game stretch, a game that featured a shouting and shoving episode, famous in SWC lore, between Lemons and Eddie Sutton after Sutton had admonished Texas player Johnny Moore on the court. Police and assistant coaches intervened, but Lemons told the media following the game that if Sutton dared to address his players again, he would \"tear his Sunday clothes\" and \"liquidate his a**.\" Struggling SMU dealt Texas a shocking defeat in the final game of the regular season, depriving the Longhorns of sole possession of the SWC crown and forcing them to share the conference championship with Arkansas for the second straight season. Following a 39\u201338 loss to the ninth-ranked Razorbacks in the SWC Tournament Final, Texas received a No. 4 seed and a bye to the second round in the 1979 NCAA tournament. Texas fell to No. 5-seeded Oklahoma in the tournament to finish the season with a 21\u20138 overall record and a No. 15 final ranking in the UPI Coaches' Poll. The Longhorns drew an average of 15,886 fans per home game in 1978\u201379, a school and Erwin Center record that to this point has not been challenged.\nThe 1979\u201380 Texas Longhorns returned only one starter, forward Ron Baxter. LaSalle Thompson, 6'10\" center and future Longhorn great, joined the program as a freshman. Texas ended the regular season with an 18\u201310 overall record and a 10\u20136 conference record, finishing third behind Texas A&M and Arkansas in SWC play. Passed over by the NCAA Tournament selection committee, Texas received a bid to the 1980 NIT, the last postseason tournament a Lemons-coached Texas team would reach. The Longhorns posted a 70\u201361 win over St. Joseph's before falling to Southwestern Louisiana, 77\u201376, in the second round to finish with a 19\u201311 overall record. Baxter, the 1980 Southwest Conference Player of the Year, finished his UT career as the then-all-time school leader in both scoring and rebounding.\nThe 1980\u201381 Longhorn team carried little in the way of preseason expectations of success. Even before the season began, the program was embroiled in controversy and turmoil. Lemons had summarily fired assistant Steve Moeller, leading to a caustic public feud between the two men, with each blaming the other for recent disappointing recruiting results. Moeller charged that Lemons' lack of inhibition with regard to public and private criticism of players was damaging the program. Only one of the four players signed in the 1981 class\u20146'9\" forward Mike Wacker\u2014was considered a coveted prospect. Texas opened with a home loss to Pacific. The regular season's zenith, a two-point win over Arkansas in Fayetteville on January 12, did nothing to reverse the team's downward trajectory, with losses to TCU, SMU, North Texas, Rice following shortly thereafter. The Longhorns stumbled to a 10\u201314 overall record with two conference games remaining. Lemons' habitual sarcasm and indiscriminately acid tongue, heretofore endearing to fans if not academic administrators, began to draw criticism, with some citing his routinely quippish comments as evidence that he failed to take his team's poor performance sufficiently seriously. Nonetheless, just as Lemons began to face notable fan frustration and criticism for the first time at Texas, his team began an unexpected run of late-season success. Lemons' team managed to win the two remaining regular season games as well as three of four games in the SWC Tournament\u2014including a 76\u201373 victory over No. 15 Arkansas in the semifinal round\u2014to avoid finishing with a losing record. The end-of-season success quelled discontent for the time being, with fans and commentators pointing to the return of LaSalle Thompson, Mike Wacker, and a healthier and more experienced supporting cast as reason for renewed confidence about the near future and optimism about the program's prospects.\nWhile his teams' records and performance had declined since the 1977\u201378 season, Lemons was not thought to be in danger of losing his job as he entered the 1981\u201382 season, the first year for new Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds and Lemons' last at Texas. Preseason expectations had Texas posting improvement over the prior season, but the 1981\u201382 Longhorns were nonetheless not expected to challenge for Southwest Conference supremacy. Texas began the season unranked, only entering the January 12 AP Poll at No. 19 after winning the first ten games of the season. Consecutive double-digit wins over No. 10 and eventual Final Four participant Houston at Hofheinz Pavilion and No. 9 Arkansas in Austin vaulted Texas to No. 7 in the following poll. An 88\u201371 nationally televised win over South Carolina the following week moved Texas to No. 5 in the AP Poll, the then-highest ranking in program history. Keyed by the performance of 1982 All-American, national rebounding champion, and eventual fifth overall 1982 NBA draft pick LaSalle Thompson and the much-improved sophomore forward Mike Wacker, the Longhorns had started the season with a record of 14\u20130, then the program's finest season start in the NCAA Tournament era. Two weeks and five losses later, the Longhorns would drop from the polls altogether. The loss of Wacker to a devastating knee injury in the first half of a 69\u201359 loss to Baylor, the Longhorns' first defeat of the year, disrupted the team's on-court chemistry and confidence and ultimately derailed the season. Texas would win only two of its final 13 games, finishing the season with a 16\u201311 overall record.\nOn March 9, eight days after the Longhorns' final game, DeLoss Dodds announced Abe Lemons' firing. Dodds was not specific as to the reasons, vaguely citing a \"series of incidents from this and past years, along with the need for new leadership and direction.\" The news met with surprise and outrage from players and fans. Lemons, who, despite some struggles, had presided over the resurrection of Texas basketball during the preceding six seasons, professed shock. Even with the collapse following Wacker's injury, there had been no indications that his job was in jeopardy. Privately, though, Dodds had faced pressure from important administrators and boosters to dismiss the popular Lemons ever since he had arrived at Texas the prior autumn. A powerful faction of UT officials and donors felt that Lemons was presiding over an undisciplined program and that he had become excessively and irresponsibly outspoken. His refusal to enforce a curfew or to punish players for missing practices, for instance, had already drawn criticism in the past. A lack of academic progress during his time at Texas was another reflection of a shortage of discipline and another cause for embarrassment for UT officials. Only one player that Lemons recruited to Austin graduated during his tenure. Moreover, his sharp-tongued and indiscriminate public insults and criticism of people ranging from UT administrators and faculty to officials and coaches at other schools to SWC administrators and referees had progressively earned Lemons the ill will and resentment of a growing number of people with influence over UT athletics. Lemons remained a popular figure among fans, but his support among administrators and powerful donors had dissipated. Following the end of the season, the UT Office of the President and the Board of Regents directed Dodds to fire Lemons, who had two years at $52,000 per year remaining on his contract. The ousted head coach did not leave quietly, commenting that he wanted a glass-bottomed car so that he could see Dodds' face as he ran him over, and adding, \"I hope they notice the mistletoe tied to my coattails as I leave town.\" Despite the acrimonious parting, Lemons would be invited back to reunions in later years and would eventually be inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1994.\nLemons finished with an overall record of 110\u201363 (.636) and a conference record of 58\u201338 (.604) as Texas head coach.\n\nBob Weltlich years (1982\u201388)\nSecond-year Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds signaled his determination to change the culture of the basketball program, noting that the next Texas head coach would be expected to oversee significant improvements in players' academic progress and off-court discipline and the near-total elimination of contact between players and boosters. Texas players petitioned in support of Barry Dowd, a long-time Lemons assistant, for the vacant coaching position, but Dodds and UT administrators were intent on severing all connections to the Lemons era. Dodds ultimately chose 37-year-old Bob Weltlich, a former assistant coach under Bob Knight at Army and Indiana who came with Knight's recommendation, from the University of Mississippi to serve as the next Texas men's basketball head coach. Dodds and Weltlich agreed to a five-year contract worth $95,000 per year, and Weltlich was introduced as head coach on April 2, 1982. At his first press conference as Texas head coach, Weltlich remarked that \"titles are won with good character\u2014and not characters\"\u2014a statement many took to be a swipe at the way Lemons had run the program.\nNicknamed \"Kaiser Bob\" by Longhorn fans for his harshly disciplinarian approach, Weltlich was almost immediately faced with such a manpower shortage from the departures\u2014both voluntary and involuntary\u2014of so many Texas players that he famously had to press Texas male cheerleader Lance Watson into service during the Longhorns' abysmal 6\u201322 season of 1982\u201383. LaSalle Thompson, who was considering bypassing his senior season but was as yet undecided at the time Weltlich was hired, ultimately left for the 1982 NBA draft. More than a dozen Longhorn players would leave the program during Weltlich's first three years, and several would make negative comments about his grueling practices and his reliance on criticism and insults as a motivational tactic upon departing. Some players who remained publicly defended Weltlich and his methods. After the new coach's first season, junior forward Bill Wendlandt commented that he believed he had gained mental discipline that he had previously lacked. Nevertheless, even Wendlandt would leave the program after the fall semester of his senior year.\nOf the 1982\u201383 Longhorn team's six wins, only three came against NCAA Division I opponents\u2014two in non-conference play against Harvard and UNC Charlotte, and one in conference play against Rice in Austin, 47\u201345. The Longhorns' 15 losses in the conference regular season came by an average of 22.5 points. The season witnessed Texas's fourth, fifth, eleventh, and thirteenth most-lopsided defeats ever\u2014a 106\u201363 loss to the No. 4 Cougars in Houston, a 96\u201359 defeat to Texas A&M in College Station, a 76\u201343 defeat at the hands of Baylor in Waco, and an 82\u201348 loss to TCU in Fort Worth. Following the 34-point loss to the Horned Frogs, Weltlich savaged his players in public comments, calling them \"as phony as the day is long.\" Texas ended the season with losses in 17 of its last 18 games and with a 13-game losing streak. The Longhorns' 6\u201322 overall record and 1\u201315 mark in SWC play represent what remain the most total and conference losses incurred in one season in program history.\nWeltlich's next three teams posted yearly improvements in overall records, although the 1983\u201384 Longhorns did so by the margin of a single game over the prior year, finishing the season 7\u201321. Texas managed four wins against Division I competition, with a 62\u201361 road win over Utah in non-conference play, to end a 21-game road losing streak, and three wins against conference competition\u2014two against Baylor and one over Rice. The Longhorns were also generally more competitive in their many defeats, with their 13 SWC losses coming by an average of 15.0 points, for a one-third reduction in the average margin of defeat from the previous season. Texas played respectably in two losses to eventual second-consecutive national runner-up Houston, losing by 11 to the No. 7 Cougars in Houston and by the same margin to No. 5 Houston in Austin. After trailing 19th-ranked Arkansas 45\u201327 at halftime in Austin, Texas narrowed the Razorbacks' lead to 68\u201366 in the final minute before Arkansas added two final points to secure the win. Nonetheless, the 1983\u201384 season saw a number of particularly lopsided defeats, with a 103\u201372 loss to SMU and a 74\u201347 loss to Texas Tech representing what remain the third- and ninth-worst home losses in program history. As fan criticism of Weltlich began to mount, Dodds professed to be \"losing no sleep over basketball at UT\" and said, \"I don't think there's any question that the direction Bob has taken is the right one. No one expected this to be easy.\"\nThough defections would continue for the remainder of Weltlich's tenure, the pace of the exodus had slowed considerably, and the team's roster began to accumulate a semblance of stability, depth, and experience by the start of his third season as head coach. Weltlich stated before the season began that his third Texas would be \"vastly improved\" over the previous two. The 1984\u201385 Longhorn team would more than double the win total of the previous year's team, posting 15\u201313 overall and 7\u20139 conference records. The Longhorns were also significantly more competitive in almost every game they played. Texas lost a hard-fought contest to No. 9 LSU in Baton Rouge in the third game of the season, 87\u201379,  and battled eventual SWC champion SMU closely during the conference season, falling 54\u201346 to the No. 3 Mustangs in Austin and 64\u201360 to No. 9 SMU in the second-to-last game of the conference slate. Of the Longhorns' 12 regular-season losses, only two came by margins greater than nine points (with 14 points being the largest margin of defeat). Texas also achieved its first victory over an NCAA Tournament-bound team under Weltlich, defeating Pac-10 Conference champion Southern California in the final game of the regular season, 71\u201370. The Longhorns were genuinely uncompetitive only in their final game of the year, a 66\u201346 loss to Arkansas in the SWC Tournament.\nThe 1985\u201386 team\u2014which finished with a 19\u201312 overall record and a share of the SWC championship\u2014marked the zenith of Weltlich's tenure at Texas. The Longhorns posted a 3\u20132 record in their first five games, losing on the road 67\u201366 to South Alabama and in an 84\u201362 blowout at Southern California. After a home win over Oral Roberts, the Longhorns traveled to Norman to face an eighth-ranked and 7\u20130 Oklahoma. Texas pushed the Sooners to overtime and led 90\u201389 with 28 seconds remaining, but an OU steal and two subsequent scores led the Sooners to a 93\u201392 win. Weltlich bemoaned his team's decision-making in the backcourt, commenting in the postgame press conference, \"We've lost our last two road games in the last second, and we haven't learned from it.\" Texas returned from Norman at 3\u20133 to face faced ninth-ranked and 7\u20130 LSU in Austin. The Longhorns led 35\u201328 at halftime, but the Tigers recovered to win, 72\u201365. LSU head coach Dale Brown described the game as his team's most difficult to date and the Texas team as sound in fundamentals. After two more home wins, Texas traveled to Atlanta to play in the Cotton States Classic. After a 35-point loss to No. 7 Georgia Tech in the opening round\u2014in what remains the second-largest margin of defeat in a neutral-site game in program history\u2014Texas posted its third one-point loss of the season in the consolation game against 20th-ranked DePaul, falling 63\u201362. The Longhorns had again built and then surrendered an early lead, having opened a 10-point advantage over the Blue Demons in the first half. Texas opened conference play with four consecutive wins, including its first win over Arkansas under Weltlich, before falling 55\u201354 to the Texas A&M Aggies in College Station. After a 63\u201356 loss to SMU in Dallas, Texas won eight consecutive conference contests, including a 61\u201357 win over Arkansas in Fayetteville\u2013Texas's first win at Barnhill Arena since 1981\u2013completing Texas's first season sweep of the Razorbacks since 1974. On February 15, Texas recorded its first sold-out home game since Abe Lemons' final year as head coach in a 58\u201347 win over Texas A&M. The Longhorns suffered their fifth one-point defeat of the season against TCU in Dallas in their penultimate conference game, falling 55\u201354 as Horned Frog guard Jamie Dixon scored on an off-balance, 30-foot jump shot at the buzzer. Texas followed up the loss to TCU with its sixth one-point loss of the season\u2014and third out of four total losses in SWC games\u2014against Texas Tech in Austin in the conference finale to surrender sole possession of first place in conference play and ultimately share the SWC championship with TCU and Texas A&M. After a semifinal loss to A&M in the conference tournament, the Longhorns were invited to the 1986 NIT\u2014the Longhorns first postseason appearance under Weltlich, and the first since the 1979\u201380 season. Texas defeated New Mexico in the first round, 69\u201366, before falling to eventual NIT champion Ohio State in the second round, 71\u201365.\nThe Longhorns opened the 1986\u201387 season with a one-point loss to No. 17 North Carolina State, 69\u201368, and an 80\u201368 loss to Alaska Anchorage. In its third game of the season, Texas stunned No. 2-ranked and defending national champion Louisville, 74\u201370, the highest-ranked opponent the Longhorns had defeated in school history. The victory presaged little about the season to come, however, as Texas finished 14\u201317 overall and 7\u20139 in SWC contests, for its third losing season in five seasons under Weltlich. Six of the Longhorns' seven victories in conference play came by five points or fewer, while six of the nine conference losses came by 10 points or more.\nFor the first time since the 1974\u201375 season, Leon Black's second to last as head coach, Texas faced no ranked opponents during the 1987\u201388 season. Nonetheless, the Longhorns finished 6\u20136 in non-conference play, losing to all three eventual NCAA tournament participants they faced\u2014falling 100\u201383 at Iowa State, 80\u201375 at home to Utah State, and 71\u201370 at Chattanooga\u2014and losing 86\u201374 at home to New Mexico, the one eventual NIT participant they faced. Texas suffered its most lopsided non-conference defeat, 85\u201356, on the road at the hands of a Miami (FL) team that would miss the postseason entirely. Texas posted a 10\u20136 record in SWC play, tying for fourth place, and lost the first game of the conference tournament to Houston, 72\u201357. For the fifth time in Weltlich's six seasons, Texas failed to advance to a postseason tournament. Four days after the loss to Houston, Weltlich was dismissed with two years remaining on his contract.\nWeltlich compiled a 77\u201398 (.440) record during six seasons as the head coach at Texas. None of his six teams managed an appearance in the NCAA Tournament; only the 1985\u201386 team participated in postseason competition, losing in the second round of the NIT. With the combination of poor overall results and an ultra-slow-tempo style of play that fans found unappealing, attendance plummeted from the lofty marks achieved during the tenure of the popular Lemons to an average of barely more than 4,000 fans per game during Weltlich's final season (far below the turnout for Jody Conradt's Lady Longhorns teams at that time).\n\nTom Penders era (1988\u201398)\nHired from the University of Rhode Island on April 6, 1988, to replace Weltlich as the Texas head coach, Tom Penders rapidly revitalized the moribund Longhorn basketball program. Months before coaching in his first game at Texas, Penders set about reviving fan enthusiasm for Longhorn men's basketball. He canvassed the state, speaking to every University of Texas alumni chapter and booster club in Texas. Penders called his team the \"Runnin' Horns,\" and he promised an exciting, fast-paced style of play that would stand in stark contrast to the basketball on display during the prior six seasons. Early on, Penders promised Texas fans, \"We'll run after made shots, missed shots, turnovers, timeouts, TV timeouts, you name it. We'll run and pressure and play 94 feet of defense.\"\nUnlike his entrance, Weltlich's departure did not result in an exodus of players from the program. Penders' first team returned four starters from the previous season, and two talented transfers\u2014Lance Blanks and Joey Wright\u2014gained eligibility, giving Texas a starting five with three future NBA Draft picks and a fourth starter who would play in the NBA. Penders led his first team to a 25\u20139 overall record, marking the first 20-win season in ten years at Texas and the then-second-highest win total in school history. He quickly validated his promise to bring high-scoring offense to Texas: in the first nine games of the 1988\u201389 season, the Longhorns scored more than 100 points five times. In Bob Weltlich's 175 games as head coach, Texas had never scored 100 or more points in a game\u2014and had only scored 90 or more points on four occasions (twice requiring an overtime period to reach that mark). The Longhorns opened the season with an 8\u20131 record before traveling to Oklahoma City to compete in the four-team All-College Tournament. Texas players openly marveled at the wholesale change in coaching philosophy from prior seasons to one that now encouraged them to shoot in large volumes, and some expressed eagerness to see how they would fare against elite competition with their new style of play. Texas defeated the OSU Cowboys 85\u201384 in the first contest behind 32 points from sophomore guard Joey Wright and two late free throws from junior guard Lance Blanks, who had transferred from Virginia. The win matched Texas in the tournament final against a high-scoring, sixth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners team only nine months removed from a four-point loss as a prohibitive favorite in the 1988 national championship game. Billy Tubbs' Sooners revealed the distance that remained between Texas and college basketball's elite teams, building a 63\u201337 halftime lead en route to an easy 124\u201395 win. Texas won six games in conference play by five or fewer points to finish in second place in the SWC with a 12\u20134 record, with two losses to Arkansas and one loss apiece to Houston and Texas A&M. Interspersed among the conference contests were games against NCAA Tournament-bound Vanderbilt, which Texas lost by a score of 94\u201379, and Miami (FL), which the Longhorns won easily, 123\u2013104. Texas defeated both SMU and TCU in overtime in the SWC Tournament to advance to the final, in which Arkansas defeated the Longhorns for the third time in 10 weeks. Texas was subsequently selected as a No. 11 seed to play in the NCAA tournament for the first time in 10 seasons, where the Longhorns would defeat the sixth-seeded Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, 76\u201370, for the program's first NCAA Tournament victory since 1972. Texas fell in the second round to the sixth-ranked and third-seeded Missouri Tigers, 108\u201389, to end the season at 25\u20139, a nine-win improvement over Weltlich's final season. The Longhorns' on-court success\u2014in combination with Penders' appealing, fast-tempo brand of basketball and his tireless promotion of the Texas program\u2014produced a rise in average home attendance from the prior season of almost 149 percent (from 4,028 to 10,011), the largest such increase in NCAA Division I basketball for the 1988\u201389 season.\n\nFor the 1989\u201390 season, Texas returned its high-scoring trio of guards, Lance Blanks, 1989 SWC player of the year Travis Mays, and Joey Wright\u2014dubbed \"BMW\u2014the ultimate scoring machine\" by the Texas sports information department and labeled the third-best set of guards in the country by Dick Vitale. Penders' second team finished 24\u20139 and qualified for the NCAA tournament for the second straight year\u2014a first in Longhorn basketball history\u2014and for only the second time since the Tournament field expanded to 64 teams. Texas defeated No. 24 Florida in Austin, 105\u201394, in the fifth game of the season for its first win against ranked competition under Penders. The Longhorns would go on to lose their remaining regular-season contests against ranked opponents\u2014to Shaquille O'Neal, Stanley Roberts, and No. 11 LSU in a neutral-site contest, 124\u2013113; to No. 4 Oklahoma in Norman, 103\u201384; to No. 6 Arkansas in Fayetteville, 109\u2013100, in a game that saw Mays depart in the first minutes due to a finger injury; and, finally, to No. 3 Arkansas in overtime in Austin, 103\u201396, in a famously bitter defeat that became known in UT lore as the \"Strollin' Nolan\" game. The Longhorns led by one point with 14 seconds remaining when Arkansas head coach Nolan Richardson, after an intentional foul call against a Razorback player, slowly walked off the court to the Arkansas locker room. The SWC officiating crew did not assess a technical foul against Richardson for leaving the court\u2014a decision that the NCAA's chief rules interpreter would label a mistake. Nonetheless, Texas appeared to have the game in hand\u2014leading by three, after Blanks made two free throws\u2014until Arkansas's Lee Mayberry, the national leader in three-point field goal percentage, made a contested 30-foot shot with four seconds remaining to tie the game at 86\u201386 and send the game into overtime. Richardson then returned to the court, eliciting a resounding chorus of boos from the crowd, and Arkansas outscored Texas 17\u201310 in the overtime period to claim the win. Two losses to Houston left Texas with a 12\u20134 record and third-place finish in conference play. The Longhorns added wins against Rhode Island\u2014the team Penders had coached before being hired by Texas\u2014and DePaul during the regular season. Against Rhode Island, Travis Mays surpassed Ron Baxter's career scoring total to become the then-leading scorer in UT history. After their third win that season over Texas A&M in the SWC Tournament, the Longhorns would fall to Houston for the third time, 89\u201386. At 21\u20138, Texas was awarded a No. 10 seed in the NCAA Tournament. After an easy 100\u201388 win over the No. 7-seed Georgia Bulldogs, the Longhorns upset Gene Keady's No. 2-seeded Purdue Boilermakers, 73\u201372, to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 18 seasons. With a come-from-behind 102\u201389 win against the 28\u20134 Xavier Musketeers\u2014in which Blanks, Mays, and Wright combined for 86 points\u2014Texas advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time in 43 years to face its SWC archrival, the Arkansas Razorbacks, for the third time that season. Trailing by 16 points with 12 minutes remaining, the Longhorns mounted a comeback that fell just short, falling 88\u201385 as Travis Mays' last-second three-point attempt came off the rim. Mays finished the season as the Southwest Conference's all-time leading scorer, with 2,279 career points. Texas was ranked No. 12 in the post-Tournament Coaches Poll, matching the 1962\u201363 team for the highest end-of-season poll ranking in program history.\nMays and Blanks having been selected in the first round of the 1990 NBA draft, the Longhorns entered the 1990\u201391 season without two-thirds of the Elite Eight team's \"BMW scoring machine.\" Even so, Texas received a preseason AP ranking of No. 22, and Penders' third team finished with a 23\u20139 overall record, advancing to the NCAA tournament and finishing with 23 or more wins for the third consecutive year. After opening with a win over Florida in Gainesville, Texas fell to No. 20 LSU in Baton Rouge, 101\u201387, and No. 16 OU in Austin, 96\u201388. Texas remained ranked until losing to No. 17 Georgia in Athens three weeks later. The Longhorns would defeat Steve Fisher's Michigan Wolverines, 76\u201374, and fall to a Tournament-bound Arizona State team, 89\u201382, before beginning conference play. After a 101\u201389 road loss to No. 2 Arkansas, Texas won ten straight games\u2014nine over SWC opponents and one over DePaul\u2014to Texas resurface in the AP Poll for one week in mid-February at No. 24. Penders finally ended both a personal and program seven-game losing streak to Arkansas in the final game of the conference regular season with the Longhorns' 99\u201386 win over the No. 3 Razorbacks in Austin, which gave Texas a 13\u20133 record and second-place finish in conference play. Texas would fall to Arkansas six days later in the SWC Tournament final\u2014the last meeting between the Longhorns and the SEC-bound Razorbacks as conference archrivals. Texas nonetheless ended the season ranked No. 23 in the final AP Poll, for the Longhorns' first appearance in the final AP Poll since the 1978 NIT Championship team, and for only the second time in program history. Texas received a No. 5 seed in the 1991 NCAA Tournament, and the Longhorns would advance from the first round for the third consecutive year before falling 84\u201376 to fourth-seeded St. John's in the second round, which made 61 percent of its shots\u2014and 71.4 percent of its first-half shots\u2014while holding Texas to just 40 percent in field-goal percentage.\nWhile the departure of Arkansas would hasten the demise of the SWC altogether in the longer term, it immediately consigned the conference\u2014one not regarded as a significant player in college basketball for several decades\u2014to virtual irrelevance in the college basketball landscape. Texas would play just three games against ranked conference opponents\u2014all against the same team, and all occurring in the same season\u2014in the remaining five seasons of the league's existence. Houston was the only remaining program that had resided among the nation's elite in recent years, but the Guy Lewis era had ended six years prior, and UH had only advanced to the NCAA Tournament twice\u2014winning no games on either occasion\u2014since its famed \"Phi Slama Jama\" teams had reached three consecutive Final Fours and two national championship games from 1982 to 1984. Penders' revived Texas program, by default, became the weakened SWC's bell cow, winning or sharing three of the final five SWC championships.\nTexas quickly took advantage of Arkansas's absence, as Penders' 1991\u201392 team finished with a 23\u201312 overall record, for his fourth consecutive season of 23 or more wins, and a share of the SWC championship. Although Texas had lost leading scorer and eventual second-round NBA draft pick Joey Wright and first-team all-SWC forward and second-leading scorer Locksley Collie to graduation, the Longhorns added transfer guard and eventual first-round draft pick B. J. Tyler and freshman guard Terrence Rencher, a prolific scorer who would receive first-team all-SWC honors as a freshman and hold several program and conference records by the end of his senior year. The Longhorns opened the season with wins over Washington and Princeton in the Preseason NIT in New York City, before falling to No. 18 Georgia Tech and No. 24 Pittsburgh in the semifinal and third-place games by scores of 120\u2013107 and 91\u201387, respectively. Texas defeated non-conference opponents Clemson and Georgia over the course of the season, but fell to No. 17 Oklahoma in Norman, 109\u2013106; No. 8 Connecticut in Austin, 94\u201377; unranked UTEP in El Paso, 92\u201388; unranked LSU in New Orleans by a score of 84\u201383; and unranked Rhode Island in Providence by a score of 92\u201379. The Longhorns nonetheless compiled an 11\u20133 conference record\u2014losing road contests to TCU, Baylor, and Rice\u2014to share the SWC championship with Houston. Texas defeated Texas A&M and Texas Tech in the SWC Tournament to advance to the final against Houston. Despite having won both regular season games against the Cougars, the Longhorns were uncompetitive in a 91\u201372 loss in their third contest. Texas was subsequently selected as a No. 8 seed in the NCAA tournament. The Longhorns lost to the Iowa Hawkeyes in the opening game by a score of 98\u201392, marking the only time in eight first-round NCAA Tournament contests under Penders that Texas would fail to advance to the second round.\nFollowing 95 wins in Penders' first four seasons at Texas\u2014with never fewer than 23 wins in a single season\u2014an injury-plagued 1992\u201393 season saw Texas struggle to an 11\u201317 overall record and a 4\u201310 record and seventh-place finish in the eight-team SWC. Point guard B. J. Tyler\u2014a key offensive player both as a scorer and as a facilitator, having averaged 18.3 points and 6.5 assists as a sophomore in 1991\u201392\u2014would miss the majority of the season. Forward-center Albert Burditt\u2014who led the 1991\u201392 team in rebounds and blocks\u2014would average 14.9 points, 14.1 rebounds, and 4.2 blocks per contest in the 1992\u201393 season, but would be limited by injury to playing in only 12 games. Following a 63\u201353 win over Princeton in the first game in a four-team tournament in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Longhorns suffered one of the most lopsided losses in school history to Dean Smith's No. 7 and eventual national champion North Carolina Tar Heels, 104\u201368. Texas fell to Utah in Salt Lake City, 87\u201376, defeated Illinois in Austin, 89\u201372, and suffered an 85\u201376 loss to No. 15 Oklahoma in the All-College Tournament before beginning conference play. Texas began 0\u20134 in SWC play and suffered four home losses among its 10 total conference defeats. In the course of the conference season, the Longhorns lost to unranked non-conference opponents LSU in a neutral-site game, Georgia in Athens, and Virginia Commonwealth (VCU) in Austin by scores of 84\u201381, 78\u201370, and 66\u201360, respectively. Texas defeated Rice in the SWC Tournament before losing to Houston in the semifinals to end the season.\nDespite the disastrous 1992\u201393 season, Texas returned a healthy roster deep with talent and experience for the 1993\u201394 season. Point guard B. J. Tyler, the future 20th overall pick in the forthcoming 1994 NBA draft, and Albert Burditt, future second-round selection in the 1994 Draft, returned in full health (Tyler after missing the first four games) after each having missed the majority of the previous season. Texas was not ranked in the preseason polls, but the potential for significant improvement was evident. Prior to the beginning of the season, sportswriter Gene Wojciechowski labeled the 1993\u201394 Longhorns a Final Four candidate, opining that Tyler, Burditt, and Terrence Rencher were the three best players in the SWC. With Tyler still absent, Texas struggled in its first four games, narrowly defeating Nebraska in Lincoln, 78\u201375, and losing a road contest to LSU and a home game against Florida by scores of 86\u201366 and 76\u201368, respectively. The Longhorns' struggles continued, as Texas fell 96\u201386 to No. 16 Connecticut in Storrs and 86\u201361 to Rick Pitino's Kentucky Wildcats in Maui to post a 2\u20134 record in its first six games. Texas won its final game in Maui against Notre Dame before facing Oklahoma in Austin. Against Oklahoma, the Longhorns were finally able to end a nine-game program losing streak (extending back to 1979) and a five-game losing streak under Penders, defeating the Sooners 87\u201375 in Austin. The Longhorns avenged the previous season's loss to Utah with a 93\u201391, double-overtime home win over Rick Majerus's Utes before losing a closely contested game at Illinois, 83\u201378. After losing its first SWC game, Texas won 18 of its next 19 games in the regular season and in winning the SWC Tournament, with its only loss coming in double-overtime to Texas Tech in Lubbock, 128\u2013125, and with its wins coming by an average of 22.1 points (and only once by fewer than 12). The Longhorns finished the SWC Tournament with a 25\u20137 overall record, a 12\u20132 conference record and outright SWC championship, and a No. 20 ranking in the final AP Poll. Texas received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA tournament and defeated Western Kentucky by a score of 91\u201377 to advance to a second-round contest against third-seeded Michigan, national runner-up the preceding two years. The Longhorns lost a close game to the Wolverines, 84\u201379, who would advance to the Elite Eight before falling to eventual national champion Arkansas, which defeated Michigan by the second-narrowest margin of its six NCAA tournament wins in 1994. Texas finished the season with a 26\u20138 overall record, matching Jack Gray's 1946\u201347 Final Four team and Abe Lemons' 1978 NIT Championship team for most wins in program history. Albert Burditt earned first-team all-SWC honors for the 1993\u201394 season. B. J. Tyler was recognized as the Southwest Conference Player of the Year and became the first Texas men's basketball player to receive All-American honors since LaSalle Thompson in 1982.\nPenders resigned on April 3, 1998, following a scandal involving the unlawful release of player Luke Axtell's grades to the media. Longhorn players Axtell, Chris Mihm, Gabe Muoneke, and Bernard Smith had met with Texas Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds \"to say that they had lost faith in Penders and his program.\"\nIn ten years at Texas, Penders' teams appeared in eight NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship NCAA Tournaments, advancing past the first round in all but one appearance. Penders finished as the then-winningest coach (by win total) in program history, with an overall record of 208\u2013110 (.654).\n\nRick Barnes era (1998\u20132015)\nHired as the twenty-third men's basketball coach in Texas history on April 12, 1998, Rick Barnes left Clemson University to take over a Texas program coming off of a losing season and \"in disarray\" following Tom Penders' resignation.\nDespite playing with just seven scholarship players for the majority of the 1998\u201399 season\u2014and opening the season with a 3\u20138 record\u2014Barnes engineered one of the greatest midseason turnarounds in school history. The Longhorns won 16 of their final 21 games, posting a 13\u20133 record in conference play and winning the school's first regular season Big 12 Conference championship by a two-game margin. Texas finished the year with a record of 19\u201313, earning with a No. 7 seed in the NCAA tournament.\nIn 2002, Texas advanced to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen for the first time since the 1996\u201397 season, and for only the third time since the expansion of the tournament to 64 participants in 1985. The 2003 Longhorn basketball team matched the school record for most basketball victories in a season with their 26\u20137 mark and advanced to the NCAA tournament Final Four round for the first time in 56 years, and for the third time in school history. Along the way, Texas earned its highest ranking in school history in both the Associated Press and the ESPN/USA Today polls (No. 2 in both polls on Dec. 2, 2002) and received its first No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Sophomore point guard T. J. Ford became the first UT male player to earn the Naismith and Wooden Awards as college basketball's National Player of the Year in 2003.\nDespite the early departure of Ford to the NBA as the eighth overall pick (Milwaukee Bucks), Texas compiled a 25\u20138 overall record in 2004 and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen round for a school-record third consecutive year. The four senior starters on the 2004 team graduated as the winningest class in school history (98 wins) to that point. In 2006, the Longhorns recorded the program's first 30-win season (30\u20137), claimed a share of the Big 12 Conference regular season championship, received a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, and advanced to the Elite Eight (Texas fell to LSU in overtime), marking the fourth time in five years that Texas had advanced to at least the NCAA Sweet Sixteen. The 2006 class, which finished with 101 wins in four years, bested the 2004 class's mark of 98 wins to become the then-winningest class in the history of Longhorn basketball.\nThe 2005\u201306 season also marked the hundredth anniversary of basketball at UT. Special logos were placed on the uniforms to commemorate this anniversary.\n\nIn 2006, the Longhorns introduced blue-chip recruit and future NBA superstar Kevin Durant to Austin. A recruiting class which included in-state talents such as Damion James and D. J. Augustin helped garner unforeseen levels of hype and scrutiny for the Texas basketball program. Durant's spectacular lone season at Texas resulted in his receiving unanimous National Player of the Year honors. The Longhorns, however, saw their season end at the hands of the USC Trojans in the second round of the 2007 NCAA tournament. Durant became the No. 2 overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the former Seattle SuperSonics, and was the 2014 NBA Most Valuable Player with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nIn the 2009 NCAA tournament, Texas earned a No. 7 seed in the East Region. The Longhorns defeated the Minnesota Golden Gophers in the first round by a score of 76\u201362 behind the sharp shooting A.J. Abrams. The Longhorns' season came to a close with a 74\u201369 second-round loss at the hands of the Duke Blue Devils. The 2009 graduating class finished with 109 wins, besting the 2006 class's mark of 101 wins to become what remains the winningest class in school history.\nDuring the 2009 recruiting cycle, Texas acquired top-tier prospects Avery Bradley and Jordan Hamilton. Partnered with veteran Damion James, center Dexter Pittman and a solid stable of guards, the Longhorns achieved their first-ever No. 1 ranking in 2010, roaring to a 17\u20130 start. Texas' fortunes turned upside-down with a 71\u201362 loss on the road to Kansas State and the ensuing 88\u201374 loss to Connecticut, beginning a 7\u201310 finish and raising the pressure for Barnes' Texas teams to reach over the hump, a recurring theme in the head coach's final six seasons in Austin. More of the same occurred in 2011, when Texas garnered two elite prospects in Canadians Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph and had a similar scorching (23\u20133) start\u2014only to lose the league to Kansas again and fall in the second round of the NCAA tournament to the Arizona Wildcats. Bradley left the program for the NBA in 2010, and Hamilton, Thompson, and Joseph followed suit in 2011.\nIn the 2012\u201313 season, Barnes' Longhorns finished 16\u201318 and missed their first NCAA tournament since 1997\u201398\u2014the season prior to Barnes' arrival. This began a slow, yet cascading trend by fans and media to replace what had become Texas' winningest basketball coach. Not much change was expected, but turbulence within the Texas athletic department ensued following Dodds' retirement in 2013. New UT Athletic Director Steve Patterson set out to dramatically change the entire Longhorn program, with the resignation of popular football coach Mack Brown following the 2013 football season. Fans and media began to speculate that Barnes' job was at similar risk; even in recruiting\u2014seen as Barnes' specialty\u2014the program could not capture much of the elite Texas talent that had begun to emerge in recent seasons.\nAfter a 2013\u201314 season in which the Horns defied very low expectations by finishing with a 24\u201311 record, tying for third place in the Big 12, and reaching the NCAA tournament, Barnes was named Big 12 Coach of the Year, and calls for his job tempered again. The 2014\u201315 season began with raised expectations from Longhorns fans and media, especially with the signing of top-ranked Dallas-area center Myles Turner. The Horns were ranked as high as No. 6 in the AP and coaches polls, yet only managed to finish sixth in the Big 12 in a very competitive season of conference play. The 20\u201314 Longhorns' loss to Butler in the opening round of the NCAA tournament marked the final game coached by Barnes at the university. After declining to meet Patterson's demand that he fire his assistants in order to save his job, Barnes was removed from his post as head basketball coach in late March.\n\nShaka Smart era (2015\u20132021)\nAfter many days of deliberation and speculation over who would fill Barnes' post, which included names such as Wichita State coach Gregg Marshall (who was heavily courted by Alabama), Villanova coach Jay Wright, and Virginia's Tony Bennett, Texas reached an agreement with Virginia Commonwealth head coach Shaka Smart on April 2, 2015. Smart was introduced as the 24th Texas men's basketball head coach the following day at a press conference in Austin.\nThe Longhorns finished 20\u201313 in Smart's first season, including a fourth-place finish in the Big 12 Conference. The scheduled included the school's first-ever basketball game in China - a 77\u201371 loss to Washington. Point guard Isaiah Taylor returned to lead the team in scoring for the second straight season, averaging 15 points per game. The Longhorns struggled at times in the season after center Cameron Ridley went down with an injured foot that caused him to miss all of conference play, returning for a brief stint in the conference tournament and in Texas' NCAA tournament game. Texas won four of its last six regular season games, including a 76\u201363 win over a top-five Oklahoma team in Austin, but lost in the first round of the Big 12 Conference tournament to Baylor, 75\u201361. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, the Longhorns lost, as a half-court shot off the backboard lifted Northern Iowa to a 75\u201372 win.\nIn 2017, the Longhorns went 11\u201322, finishing with their most losses since the 1983 season. Texas struggled with consistency early in the season, but after leading scorer Tevin Mack was suspended in January, the Longhorns went 4-12 the rest of the way, including seven straight losses to end the regular season. Mack, a sophomore guard, left the team and transferred to Alabama. Freshman center Jarrett Allen led Texas the rest of the way, averaging 16 points and almost 10 rebounds in Big 12 Conference play. Allen declared for the NBA draft after the season, and the Brooklyn Nets selected him with the 22nd pick of the first round.\nUnder Smart, the Longhorns' recruiting situation improved dramatically, with players such as Matt Coleman, Andrew Jones, Mo Bamba, Jaxson Hayes, and Greg Brown standing out for the team during that time. Texas made the NCAA tournament in 2018, losing to Nevada in the first round, followed by an NIT win in 2019. The 2019\u201320 season was seen as a failure until a late-season rally by the Longhorns, which arguably saved Smart's job, along with the COVID-19 pandemic which canceled the NCAA tournament that year.\nIn 2020\u201321, the Longhorns won their first Big 12 tournament title, following a strong showing in a regular season marred by COVID-19 cancellations (including the Longhorns' own semifinal against Kansas). After defeating Oklahoma State for the Big 12 title, Texas suffered arguably its most infamous loss in school history, as the third-seeded Longhorns fell, 53\u201352, to 14th-seeded Abilene Christian in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Smart, under duress, decamped for Marquette on March 26.\n\nChris Beard era (2021\u20132023)\nOn April 1, 2021, Texas Tech head basketball coach Chris Beard accepted the head coaching position at Texas. Widely considered the top candidate from the moment Smart departed, Beard is a 1995 alumnus of the University of Texas and served as student manager under Tom Penders during his time on campus.\nIn Beard's only full season of coaching at the school, Texas managed 22 wins and an NCAA appearance, which ended in the second round at the hands of Purdue. The 2022\u201323 'Horns started strongly at 7\u22121 before Beard was suspended in December for allegations of domestic violence.\nOn January 5, 2023, Beard was fired as head coach amid a felony domestic violence charge, which was later dropped as the alleged victim recanted her initial statements.\n\nRodney Terry as interim coach (2022\u22122023)\nRodney Terry, Beard's top assistant, was given the reins on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. Terry guided a senior- and transfer-heavy Longhorn team to a second-place Big 12 finish, behind perennial conference power Kansas. Silver linings in Terry's interregnum included an emphatic 75\u221259 victory over the Jayhawks in the final regular season game, which portended the team's eventual performance in the 2023 Big 12 tournament.\nTexas would defeat Kansas in the tournament final to clinch an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament, the second time in three years this has occurred and the first tournament final win over Kansas in school history.\nIn the NCAA tournament the Horns would defeat Colgate, Penn State, and Xavier en route to the school's first Elite Eight appearance in 15 years; the squad would lead Miami by double-figures in the second half but ultimately fell short, 88\u201381. The team finished with a 22\u20138 record with Terry as interim coach.\n\nRodney Terry era (2023\u20132025)\nOn March 27, 2023, Rodney Terry agreed to a deal to become Texas's full-time Head Coach. Terry signed a 5-year, $15.3 million contract.\nTerry would advance to three NCAA tournaments, two further after being named permanent head coach. He notably guided the Longhorns in the university's first season as a member of the Southeastern Conference, which yielded a narrow NCAA tournament qualification. Terry was fired by Texas in 2025 after losing an NCAA tournament First Four game to Xavier, who was coached by the man who immediately followed Terry, Sean Miller.\n\nSean Miller era (2025\u2013present)\nSean Miller was named Texas head coach on March 25, 2025. He received a six-year deal to coach the Longhorns.\n\nFacilities\nClark Field (1906\u201312, 1914\u201316)\nClark Field, originally known as Varsity Athletic Field, was an on-campus, outdoor stadium that was the original home of the Texas Longhorns men's basketball team, as well as the Longhorn football, baseball, and track teams. The stadium opened in 1887. In its final years, the facility held 20,000 spectators.\nThe Texas Longhorns men's basketball team moved indoors to the new Men's Gym in 1917.\n\nBen Hur Temple (1913)\nHead coach Carl C. Taylor, seeking an indoor home venue for the basketball team, reached an agreement with the Ben Hur Temple in downtown Austin to rent the building's theater for basketball games and five hours of practice weekly for the 1913 season for $75. The building was originally constructed in 1872 as an opera house for the Turnverein, a German gymnastics, social, and cultural society, and it had been purchased in 1912 by the Shriners and Scottish Rite Masons. Basketball goals were mounted on the balcony and in front of the stage, boundary lines were drawn on the double-layer pine floor, and bleachers were erected on each side of the diminutive court, bringing seating capacity to roughly 350 people, including spectators in the balcony and on the stage.\nDue to the insufficient size of the court and capacity of the theater, the off-campus location, and the added expense of renting the facility, the basketball team returned to its outdoor home at Clark Field for the 1914 to 1916 seasons.\n\nMen's Gym (1917\u201328)\nThe university constructed the Men's Gym adjacent to Clark Field to serve as the temporary home of the Texas men's basketball team pending the construction of a permanent gymnasium. Built for a total cost of $8,500, the all-wood Men's Gym measured 115' by 105' and 23' high and featured a pinewood floor, an electric scoreboard, and seating for 2,500 spectators.\nThe Texas men's basketball team played home games in the Men's Gym beginning with the 1917 season through the end of the 1927\u201328 season. On March 25, 1928, the Men's Gym caught fire and burned to the ground. While the loss of the Men's Gym advanced the timeline for the construction of a new gymnasium for men's basketball, the team would be left without an on-campus home for the following two seasons, playing instead in the gymnasiums of the Texas School for the Deaf and Austin High School before moving into the new Gregory Gymnasium for the 1930\u201331 season.\n\nTexas School for the Deaf and Austin High School Gymnasiums (1928\u201330)\nFor the 1928\u201329 season, the university reached an agreement with the Texas School for the Deaf for the Texas men's basketball team to play its home games in TSD's recently constructed fieldhouse. The TSD fieldhouse had a seating capacity of just one-sixth of the Men's Gym, precluding the sale of tickets to the general public and requiring the use of a lottery for the allocation of tickets to students and existing season ticket holders.\nProlonged inclement weather delayed the completion of Gregory Gymnasium, originally intended to debut in the 1929\u201330 season with the Southwest Conference opening home game against Baylor, and, consequently, the Longhorns had to play home games away from campus for the entirety of the season. Texas played its nonconference games in the TSD Gym before moving into the recently completed 1,500-seat Austin High School Gymnasium for its five SWC home games.\n\nGregory Gymnasium (1930\u201377)\nOriginally built in 1930, Gregory Gymnasium was named after its main advocate and planner, Thomas Watt Gregory. An alumnus of the university, Gregory served on the university's Board of Regents and as United States Attorney General (1914\u201319) before the gym was built. Gregory Gymnasium is located on the UT central campus, a short distance southeast of the UT Main Building, Tower, and Main Mall and facing west onto Speedway Avenue, the campus's central north\u2013south street.\nThe Texas men's basketball team played home games in Gregory Gymnasium beginning with the 1930\u201331 season until moving into the Special Events Center (later renamed the Frank Erwin Center) for the 1977\u201378 season.\n\nFrank Erwin Center (1977\u20132022)\nThe Texas men's basketball team opened the Frank Erwin Center on November 29, 1977, with an 83\u201376 victory over the Oklahoma Sooners. The Longhorns won their first 25 games in the Erwin Center before falling to Arkansas in February 1979.\nBuilt for a total cost of $34 million, the building is named for former UT alumnus and Board of Regents member Frank Erwin. Originally known as the Special Events Center, the facility was renamed in 1981 to honor Erwin, who had died earlier that year. The Erwin Center is located at the southeastern corner of the UT central campus and is bounded on the east by Interstate 35.\n\nA two-level layout (the lower arena and upper mezzanine) currently accommodates up to 16,540 spectators for basketball games. UT undertook extensive renovations of the facility from 2001 to 2003 at a cost of $55 million, adding, among other things, new and renovated seating, new video and sound systems, new lighting, and 28 suites. As part of the project, UT constructed the Denton A. Cooley Pavilion, a state-of-the-art practice and training facility that sits adjacent to the Erwin Center.\nThe master plan released in 2013 for the university's new Dell Medical School indicated that the Erwin Center would be demolished in a later phase of construction within 6\u201315 years. In 2022, the Erwin Center was replaced by the Moody Center\n\nDenton A. Cooley Pavilion practice and training facility (2003\u20132022)\nBuilt during the final phase of the renovation of the Erwin Center, the Denton A. Cooley Pavilion opened in the fall of 2003. The two-level, 44,000-square-foot building sits adjacent to the Erwin Center and serves as a state-of-the-art practice and training facility for the Texas men's and women's basketball teams. The Pavilion is named for Dr. Denton A. Cooley, a UT alumnus, basketball letterman (1939\u201341), and pioneering heart surgeon.\nThe Texas men's and women's basketball teams have separate 9,000-square-foot practice court areas, each consisting of one full-court and one half-court practice area with seven basket stations. The practice facility also includes a locker room with a players' lounge, an instructional film theater, a 4,100-square-foot strength and conditioning area, an athletic training and hydrotherapy area, an academic resource and activity center, and a coaches' lounge and locker room.\nThe Cooley Pavilion will be demolished and replaced during the same phase of construction of the Dell Medical School as the Erwin Center.\n\nMoody Center (2022\u2013present)\nMoody Center is a $375M, 15,000+ seat premier venue featuring over 150 nights a year of unique entertainment. Moody Center features the best and biggest names in the music industry while hosting The University of Texas Women's and Men's basketball games, family shows and other sporting and local events.\n\nNew Texas basketball and rowing training facility\nTo replace the Cooley Pavilion, Texas is building a new basketball practice facility adjacent to the new Moody Center. This new facility will include locker rooms for both teams, training areas, 2 full-sized practice courts, weight room, and team offices. It will also be combined with a practice facility for the Texas Rowing team.\n\nCoaching records\nChampionships\nNational championships\n\nConference championships\n\nInvitational tournament championships\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nTexas has appeared in the NCAA tournament on 39 occasions (ninth-most appearances all time, and second only to Kentucky among Southeastern Conference members). The Longhorns' overall record in the Tournament is 40\u201342, with one loss vacated by NCAA action taken against a Longhorn opponent.\n\n*Following the introduction of the \"First Four\" round in 2011, the Round of 64 and Round of 32 were referred to as the Second Round and Third Round, respectively, from 2011 to 2015.\n\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the Tournament in 1979. Texas has appeared in 32 of the 46 seeded Tournaments (and in 31 of the last 36).\n\nNIT results\nThe Longhorns have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 11\u20133. Texas won the NIT Championship in 1978 and 2019.\n\nCBI results\nThe Longhorns have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time. Their record is 0\u20131.\n\nPolls\nAP and coaches polls\nTexas has been ranked in at least one of the final AP or coaches polls in 21 seasons since their introduction prior to the 1948\u201349 and 1950\u201351 seasons, respectively. The Longhorns have recorded seven top-ten finishes and three top-five finishes in one or more of the final polls. Ten of Rick Barnes' teams, five of Tom Penders' teams, two of Abe Lemons' teams, and two of Harold Bradley's teams finished the season ranked. As of April 1, 2025, Texas teams have been ranked in 318 of 1300 total weekly AP Polls (24.5%) since the inception of the poll in the 1948\u201349 season (31st all-time in AP Poll appearances), and in 361 of 1286 total weekly coaches polls (28.1%) since the inception of the poll in the 1950\u201351 season.\n\nPremo-Porretta Power Poll (pre-1949)\nTexas has been ranked in the retroactively assigned Premo-Porretta Power Poll rankings in 11 seasons from the 1906 season through the 1947\u201348 season, the final season before the introduction of the AP Poll. Five Longhorn teams were ranked among the top-ten teams in their respective years, and three Texas teams received top-three rankings. Texas was selected as the poll's national champion for the 1932\u201333 season.\n\nAll-time series records\nAll-time series records against SEC members\nAll-time series records against former Big 12 members\nAll-time series records against non-Big 12 former SWC members\nIn series against former Southwest Conference members who are not current members of the Big 12, Texas does not trail any opponent.\nIn contests against these opponents since the dissolution of the Southwest Conference, Texas holds the lead against all opponents but SMU, whom the Longhorns have not played since joining the Big 12. The Longhorns hold the advantage against every opponent in the last five games played and in the last ten games played against each respective opponent.\n\nRecords against all other collegiate opponents\nRivalries\nBig 12 rivals\nOklahoma Sooners\nWith the formation of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, the Oklahoma Sooners became the Longhorns' main rival in basketball. Texas and Oklahoma are not traditional rivals in any sport other than football, due to their prior residence in different conferences (UT in the Southwest Conference and OU in the Big Eight Conference); nonetheless, the two basketball programs had already compiled a significant series history prior to formation of the Big 12, having met 14 times from 1947 to 1957, 11 times from 1986 until the beginning of Big 12 competition in 1997, and at various other times in the programs' histories. The Sooners entered the Big with a 29\u201313 lead in the all-time series, having won 10 of the 11 games played from 1986 to 1996. In the Big 12, the competitiveness of the Texas and OU basketball programs\u2014which are second and third in all-time Big 12 regular season conference wins, respectively\u2014only accelerated the development of the basketball rivalry.\nThe Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners play one game in Austin and one game in Norman each year during the regular season. Oklahoma leads the overall series 54\u201339; Texas leads 26\u201325 in games played since the inception of the Big 12. Texas has held the upper hand in recent years, winning 23 of 35 meetings from 2003 to 2018.\n\nKansas Jayhawks\nRick Barnes' tenure also coincided with the emergence of a rivalry between Texas and the Big 12 Conference's traditional national basketball powerhouse, the Kansas Jayhawks. Under Rick Barnes, the Longhorns emerged as Kansas's most consistent competition for Big 12 Conference supremacy. From the inception of the Big 12 through February 18, 2018, Texas has produced a 223\u2013139 (.616) mark against conference competition during the regular season, trailing only Kansas's record of 299\u201363 (.826).\nThe first decade of the 2000s saw the peak of this new rivalry, with the Longhorns at one point trailing Kansas only 5\u20137 in games played over an almost-nine-season period, and with many of the contests being closely contested classics. Since the beginning of the 2008\u201309 season, Texas has been less competitive both nationally and in the rivalry, trailing Kansas 2\u201315 in games played since that time.\nTexas and Kansas played one game during the regular season until the 2011\u201312 season, when the two schools began meeting twice per year. Kansas leads the overall series 30\u20138 and has won 26 of the 33 contests since the Big 12 was formed. Current KU head coach Bill Self is 20\u20136 in games against Texas since becoming the Jayhawks' head coach prior to the 2003\u201304 season.\n\nBaylor Bears\nThe Longhorns' series with the Baylor Bears has featured more games played than any other UT basketball series; it is also the conference series most lopsided in UT's favor, with the exception of the Longhorns' series against former Southwest Conference opponent Rice and the much more abbreviated series against former Big 12 member Nebraska. Texas leads 162\u201390 in the overall series with Baylor.\nThe intensity of the in-state rivalry has grown sharply in recent years with Baylor's emergence as a nationally competitive program under current head coach Scott Drew. Through the end of the 2008\u201309 regular season, Texas held a 25\u20133 record against Baylor in Big 12 competition and a 24\u20130 record against the Bears under Rick Barnes. In games played since the 2009 Big 12 conference tournament semifinals, Baylor holds a 15\u20137 edge over Texas.\n\nTexas Tech Red Raiders\nTexas and Texas Tech have played at least twice yearly since the 1957\u201358 season. The Longhorns and the Red Raiders play one game in Austin and one game in Lubbock each year during the regular season.\nAt the time that UT and Texas Tech entered the Big 12, Texas Tech held a 49\u201345 lead in the all-time series against Texas. Longtime Red Raider coach Gerald Myers' teams dominated the Longhorns for much of the 1970s and 1980s, with the only interlude of Longhorn success occurring during the six-year tenure of Abe Lemons (1976\u201382), who finished 8\u20134 against the Red Raiders. By the time Tom Penders became the Texas head coach prior to the 1988\u201389 season, Texas Tech held a 43\u201332 lead in the series. Penders narrowed Texas Tech's lead to 50\u201349 during his tenure (1988\u201398). During Rick Barnes' 17 seasons as head coach (1998\u20132015), the Longhorns posted a 33\u20134 record against the Red Raiders, for a period of dominance unequaled at any other point in the series.\nTexas currently leads the overall series 86\u201357 and has won 41 of the 49 contests since the formation of the Big 12.\n\nOklahoma State Cowboys\nThe formation of the Big 12 led to the development of a competitive rivalry between Texas and the Oklahoma State Cowboys, two programs that had already compiled a significant series history despite their residence in different conferences since OSU's departure from the Southwest Conference following the 1924\u201325 season. Between 1941 and 1979, Texas and OSU met 32 times, with the Cowboys winning 21 of the meetings. At the time of the formation of the Big 12, OSU held a 24\u201319 lead in the all-time series.\nThe rivalry reached its peak in the early years of the Big 12, above all when the tenures of Rick Barnes and Eddie Sutton coincided at the two schools, a time when both programs were nationally prominent. From the 1999\u20132000 season through the 2004\u201305 season, at least one of the two teams was ranked in 13 of 14 total contests, and both teams were ranked at the time of eight of the 14 meetings. In recent years, the rivalry has declined in intensity as both programs have receded from the national spotlight.\nTexas and Oklahoma State have played at least twice yearly since 1997, the first Big 12 basketball season. The Longhorns and the Cowboys play one game in Austin and one game in Stillwater each year during the regular season. Texas currently leads the overall series 49\u201343 and holds a 30\u201319 lead in games played in Big 12 competition.\n\nOther rivals\nArkansas Razorbacks\nTexas and Arkansas shared a bitter rivalry in basketball\u2014stoked by the mutual enmity that characterized their primary rivalry in football\u2014throughout most of the existence of the Southwest Conference. Until Arkansas' departure for the Southeastern Conference after the 1990\u201391 season, the Longhorns and the Razorbacks had played at least twice\u2014and often three times\u2014each year since the 1924 season. Texas and Arkansas each won or shared 22 SWC championships (nine more than the nearest competitor, SMU)\u2014although Texas claimed seven of these in the years before Arkansas established its basketball program in 1924 and in the years after Arkansas left the conference.\nThe Texas\u2013Arkansas basketball rivalry was particularly competitive in its first quarter-century, and both programs enjoyed substantial overall success during this time, with each appearing in two Final Fours and one Elite Eight with the beginning of the NCAA Tournament in 1939 through the end of the 1940s. Arkansas led the series 29\u201325 over this span.\nBoth Texas and Arkansas faded from national significance with the end of the 1940s. From the 1949\u201350 season through the 1975\u201376 season, Arkansas won only two SWC championships, made only a single NCAA Tournament appearance, and posted an overall record of 312\u2013338 (.480). Texas fared modestly better during this time, winning seven SWC championships, making four NCAA Tournament appearances, and posting an overall record of 342\u2013323 (.514). The Longhorns and Razorbacks split their conference series during this period, with each winning 29 games.\nThe rivalry grew especially heated from the mid-1970s onward as both schools' athletic departments poured additional resources into their basketball programs, both for coaching hires and for facilities, each seeking to revive programs that had receded from the national stage over the preceding quarter-century. While both Texas and Arkansas appeared to be on the verge of establishing nationally competitive programs with the hires of Abe Lemons and Eddie Sutton, respectively, only Arkansas managed to achieve sustained success in the following years, winning at least 20 games in 13 seasons from 1977 to 1991, with Sutton (1974\u201385) and Nolan Richardson (1985\u20132002) each reaching a Final Four and an Elite Eight. (Richardson would lead the Razorbacks to two more Final Fours and a national championship after Arkansas' departure from the SWC.) Arkansas dominated the series over this final phase of the SWC rivalry, winning 27 out of 37 games played during this period.\nArkansas led the series 85\u201364 upon leaving the SWC; the Razorbacks currently lead the all-time series 87\u201368, with Texas having won four of the six games played since Arkansas joined the SEC.\n\nTexas A&M Aggies\nBefore the Texas A&M Aggies' departure for the Southeastern Conference at the end of the 2012 academic year, Texas and Texas A&M had played at least twice (and up to four times) yearly since 1917. During their concurrent membership in the Big 12, the Longhorns and the Aggies played two games during the regular season, with the venue alternating between the home courts of each school. Texas leads the overall series 137\u201386.\nBy the time the Big 12 was formed, the in-state rivalry was at a low ebb. The Longhorns had won 18 of the previous 21 contests against the Aggies, dating back to the 1987\u201388 season. Texas continued to dominate the series in Big 12 play, winning 15 of the first 16 contests between the schools in their new conference. By the time the Aggies hired Billy Gillispie prior to the 2004\u201305 season, the lopsided nature of the series\u2014and the lack of Aggie fan interest in a program that had gone ten consecutive years without a winning season or postseason appearance under prior coaches\u2014had long since diminished the stature of the once-heated rivalry.\nWith the rejuvenation of the Texas A&M basketball program under Billy Gillispie (2004\u201307) and Mark Turgeon (2007\u201311), the basketball rivalry between Texas and Texas A&M quickly intensified. The Aggies successfully defended their home court from Gillispie's first year through the 2009\u201310 season, Mark Turgeon's second-to-last season with A&M. The Longhorns defeated the Aggies in all three games in Turgeon's final season and in both games in Billy Kennedy's first season with the Aggies. Texas is 12\u20137 against Texas A&M since Gillispie was hired in 2004.\nThe rivalry will be renewed when Texas joins A&M in the SEC prior to the 2024\u201325 season.\n\nIndividual honors, awards, and accomplishments\nHonors, awards, and accomplishments by player\nThe individual honors, awards, and accomplishments listed in the succeeding subsections are aggregated by player in the following table. Players with only all-conference honors (other than conference player of the year), lower than first-team All-America honors, or later than second-round draft positions are not included.\n\nNaismith Basketball Hall of Fame\nSlater Martin is the only Longhorn men's basketball player to have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. Martin was inducted on May 3, 1982.\n\nRetired numbers\nThree Longhorn men's basketball players have had their Texas jersey numbers retired: Slater Martin, T. J. Ford, and Kevin Durant.\nThe primary requirement for the retirement of a UT student-athlete's number is that the individual have won a widely recognized National Player of the Year award. Former UT Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds stated that an exception was made in the case of Slater Martin because, as a Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, he was a legend in the sport of basketball but had competed before any of the widely recognized awards were established (the Sporting News Men's College Basketball Player of the Year was established in 1943, but it was not awarded from 1947 to 1949).\n\nNational honors and awards (players)\nNational Player of the Year\nT. J. Ford and Kevin Durant are the only Texas players to win one or more of the widely recognized National Player of the Year awards. Ford won the Naismith Trophy and the Wooden Award\u2014as well as four of the other eight widely recognized awards\u2014in 2003 as a sophomore. Durant was the unanimous national player of the year in 2007 as a true freshman, winning all 10 awards. Durant was the first freshman ever to win any of the National Player of the Year awards.\n\nBob Cousy Collegiate Point Guard of the Year Award\nThe Bob Cousy Award is awarded annually by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to the top point guard in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The award was presented for the first time following the 2003\u201304 college basketball season (the season following T. J. Ford's departure to the NBA). D. J. Augustin is the only Longhorn to win the Bob Cousy Award.\n\nPerry Wallace Most Courageous Award\nThe Perry Wallace Most Courageous Award is the men's version of the USBWA Most Courageous Award, presented annually by the United States Basketball Writers Association to one or more individuals (not necessarily players) who, in the organization's words, have \"demonstrated extraordinary courage reflecting honor on the sport of amateur basketball.\" First presented in 1978 as a single award, separate men's and women's awards were first presented in 2010. The award's bifurcation by sex or gender does not reflect that of the recipient, but is instead based on whether the recipient was involved with the men's or women's game. This award was originally not restricted to college basketball, but every recipient since 1980 has been associated with the college game. The men's award was renamed in 2021 in memory of Wallace, the first African American to play basketball in the Southeastern Conference. Andrew Jones is the first Longhorn to receive this award; he shared 2022 honors with Justin Hardy, a player at NCAA Division III Washington (MO). Both averaged double figures in scoring for their respective teams in 2021\u201322 while battling cancer (leukemia for Jones, stomach cancer for Hardy).\n\nAll-America honors\nTwenty Texas basketball players have received All-America honors on 26 occasions; six have been recognized as All-Americans in two different seasons. Seven Longhorns have received consensus first-team All-America honors, and three others have received consensus second-team All-America honors. Thirteen Texas players have received first-team All-America honors in 14 seasons, with one Longhorn player having been selected as a first-team All-American twice.\n\nConference honors and awards (players)\nConference Player of the Year\nTexas players have won conference player of the year honors on ten occasions\u2014eight times in the Southwest Conference and twice in the Big 12 Conference. Two Longhorn basketball players won SWC player of the year honors twice. Three Texas players have won Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year honors.\n\nFirst-team all-conference honors\nSeventy-two Texas men's basketball players have received first-team all-conference honors on 96 occasions. Of these 72 players, 18 have received first-team all-conference honors in two seasons, and three players have received them in three seasons.\nFirst-team All-Southwest Conference\n\nFirst-team All-Big 12 Conference\n\nFreshman Player of the Year\nEight Longhorn freshmen men's basketball players have won conference freshman of the year honors\u2014three players in the Southwest Conference and five players in the Big 12 Conference.\nSouthwest Conference Freshman of the Year\n\nBig 12 Conference Freshman of the Year\n\nSEC Freshman of the Year\n\nConference tournament most valuable player\nFive Longhorn men's basketball players have won conference tournament most valuable player honors\u2014four players in the Southwest Conference tournament and one player in the Big 12 Conference tournament.\nSouthwest Conference tournament Most Outstanding Player\n\nBig 12 Conference tournament Most Valuable Player\n\nProfessional basketball\nNBA draft history\nAs of July 30, 2021, 48 Longhorn men's basketball players have been selected in the NBA draft in the history of the program. Of these, 19 were selected in the first round, and 13 were selected in the second round. Among Big 12 programs, Texas trails only Kansas (33) in the number of players drafted in the first round all-time.\nSince 1997, Texas has had 23 players drafted overall; of these, 15 were drafted in the first round. Among Big 12 programs, Texas trails only Kansas (34 picks overall, 22 first-round picks) in the numbers of players drafted overall and in the first round during this period. The 15 Longhorn players drafted in the first round from 1997 to 2021 exceed the all-time numbers of first-round picks at each Big 12 school but Kansas.\n\nNBA players\nAs of October 23, 2025, 42 Texas players have played in the NBA in league history. Of these, 20 played at Texas under Rick Barnes. Seven Longhorn players currently play in the NBA.\nAll-time NBA players\n\nCurrent NBA players\n\nNon-NBA professional players\nAll-time non-NBA professional players\nCurrent non-NBA professional players\n\nAndrew Jones (born 1997), Austrian Basketball Superliga\nSir'Jabari Rice (born 1998), Czech Republic National Basketball League\nZe'Rik Onyema (born 2002), Finland Korisliiga\nMarcus Carr (born 1999), German Basketball Bundesliga\nJulian Larry (born 2002), German ProA\nElijah Mitrou-Long (born 1996), Greek Basketball League\nMatt Coleman III (born 1998), Israeli Basketball Premier League\nKadin Shedrick (born 2001), Israeli Basketball Premier League\nTimmy Allen (born 2000), Italian Lega Basket Serie A\nJ'Covan Brown (born 1990), Turkish Basketbol S\u00fcper Ligi\nChristian Bishop (born 2000), Turkish Basketbol S\u00fcper Ligi\nKai Jones (born 2001), Turkish Basketbol S\u00fcper Ligi\n\nOlympians\nFour Longhorn men's basketball players have competed in the Olympic Games in men's basketball on six occasions, with three players winning gold medals.\nKevin Durant was the leading scorer on the United States men's basketball team that won the gold medal in the 2012 Olympics. Durant's 156 total points during the Olympic tournament set a record for most points scored by an American basketball player in Olympic competition, surpassing the record previously set by Spencer Haywood in the 1968 Olympics by 11 points. Durant also set the U.S. record for most made three-point shots in an Olympic competition with 34 (on 65 attempts). In addition to leading the U.S. team in scoring, he finished second on the team in rebounding, first in blocked shots, and second in steals.\nIn the 2016 Olympics, Durant again led the U.S. men's team in scoring with 155 total points\u2014one point fewer than his U.S. Olympic record from 2012\u2014and in minutes played. He finished second on the team in steals, third in assists, and fourth in rebounding. Durant converted 25 three-point shots on only 43 attempts (.581).\n\nCoaching honors and awards\nNational Coach of the Year honors\nAbe Lemons (1976\u201382) won the NABC National Coach of the Year award following his second season at Texas, a season that saw the Longhorns finish 26\u20135, win a share of the Southwest Conference title, and win the 1978 NIT Championship. Texas had finished just 9\u201317 two years earlier in Leon Black's last season as head coach.\nRodney Terry was named Sporting News National Coach of the year for the 2022\u201323 season, becoming the first Texas coach to win the award since it was introduced in 1964.\n\nJohn R. Wooden Legends of Coaching Award\nThe Wooden Legends of Coaching Award is a lifetime achievement award established prior to the 1998\u201399 season. Selection for the award depends upon a number of on- and off-court factors, from coaching success and philosophy to evidence of good character to graduation rates. Rick Barnes won the Wooden Legends of Coaching Award following the 2008\u201309 season.\n\nConference Coach of the Year honors\nAbe Lemons was recognized as the Southwest Conference Coach of the Year for the 1977\u201378 season, the season that saw him win the NABC National Coach of the Year award. Tom Penders received Southwest Conference Coach of the Year honors in 1994 and 1995, and Rick Barnes was named Big 12 Coach of the Year in 1999, 2003, 2008, and 2014.\n\nDistrict-level Coach of the Year honors\nRick Barnes won recognition as NABC District 9 Coach of the Year in five seasons (1999, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2014). Barnes was also a four-time recipient of USBWA District VII Coach of the Year honors (1999, 2001, 2003, 2011).\n\nRecords\nTeam records include single-season, single-game, and NCAA tournament records for the Texas program. Program records for individual players include career totals and averages as well as single-season totals and averages.\nAll records are current as of the end of the 2014\u201315 season.\n\nTeam

    "summary": "The Texas Longhorns men's basketball team represents the University of Texas at Austin in NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball competition. The Longhorns competed in the Big 12 Conference through the 2023\u201324 season and moved to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) on July 1, 2024.\nThe University of Texas began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1906. The Longhorns rank 15th in total victories among all NCAA Division I college basketball programs and 23rd in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 60 years in Division I, with an all-time win\u2013loss record of 1,920\u20131,158 (.624). Among Southeastern Conference men's basketball programs, Texas is second only to Kentucky in all-time wins and trails only Kentucky and Arkansas in all-time win percentage.\nAs of the end of the 2024\u201325 season, the Longhorns have won 29 total conference championships in men's basketball and have made 39 total appearances in the NCAA tournament (ninth-most appearances all time, with a 40\u201342 overall record), reaching the NCAA Final Four three times (1943, 1947, 2003) and the NCAA regional finals (Elite Eight) eight times. As of the end of the 2024\u201325 season, Texas ranks fourth among all Division I men's basketball programs for total NCAA Tournament games won without having won the national championship (40), tied with Kansas State and Notre Dame, and trailing Oklahoma (43), Illinois (46), and Purdue (51).\nThe Texas basketball program experienced substantial success during the early decades of its existence, but its success in the modern era is of relatively recent vintage. After two losing seasons during the program's first five years, Texas suffered only one losing season from 1912 to 1950, achieving a winning percentage of .703 during that span, reaching two Final Fours and one Elite Eight during the first decade of the NCAA Tournament, and receiving retroactive recognition as the 1933 national champion from the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. From 1951 to 1988, the Longhorns finished with losing records 14 times, recorded a winning percentage of .522, and participated in the expanded Tournament only five times. Texas achieved some measure of national recognition during the tenures of head coaches Abe Lemons (1976\u201382) and Tom Penders (1988\u201398), but the program rose to its highest level of prominence under the direction of former head coach Rick Barnes (1998\u20132015). Barnes guided Texas to 16 NCAA tournament appearances in his 17 seasons with the program, including a school-record 14 consecutive appearances (1999\u20132012), as well as fifteen 20-win seasons overall and a school-best 13 consecutive 20-win seasons (2000\u201312).\nTexas plays its home games in the Moody Center, which opened prior to the start of the 2022\u201323 season. The team is led by first-year head coach Sean Miller, formerly the head coach at Xavier and Arizona, who was hired on March 24, 2025, following the dismissal of former head coach Rodney Terry.",

  "Texas Tech Red Raiders": {
    "biography": "The Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball team represents Texas Tech University in basketball. Texas Tech competes in NCAA Division I and has been a charter member of the Big 12 Conference since its first season in 1996. The team previously competed in the Border Conference and Southwest Conference. The team was founded in 1925, having since won 13 regular season conference championship, and made 21 appearances in the NCAA tournament as of the 2024\u20132025 season. Since 1999, the Red Raiders have played their home games at the United Supermarkets Arena on the university's campus in Lubbock, Texas.\n\nHistory\n1925\u20131935\nTexas Tech's basketball program was founded the same year the school opened its doors in 1925. The inaugural game was a 37\u201325 loss to Daniel Baker College. Tech would lose two more games before finally clinching their first ever victory\u201435\u201321 at Sul Ross University.\nGrady Higginbotham was the first coach, earning a 14\u201318 record over two seasons. Until Pat Knight, Higgenbotham was the only Tech basketball coach to garner an overall losing record (.438) during his stay. Following Higgenbotham's departure, Victor Payne led the Matadors (as the school's teams were known until 1936) from 1927 to 1930. His final tally stood at 32 wins and 20 losses. W. L. Golightly coached only one season, bringing in an 11\u20139 record. Dell Morgan held the head coaching job from 1931 to 1934, chalking up 42 wins to 29 losses. He was followed by Virgil Ballard. Though Ballard coached only a single season, it was during his time that the team won their milestone 100th game, a one-point victory over House of David. Ballard left with a 15\u20139 record.\n\n1935\u20131971\nBerl Huffman was twice the head basketball coach at Texas Tech\u2014first from 1935 to 1942 and then from 1946 to 1947. During his total of eight seasons, he garnered a record of 121\u201367. Polk Robison was the only other person to serve two different times as the head basketball coach at the school. When Huffman left in 1942, Robison took the job. And, when Huffman left a second time in 1947, it was Robison who again filled the position, this time remaining until 1961. At a total of 18 seasons, his stay is the second longest of any Red Raiders basketball coach, behind Gerald Myers. He departed after leading his teams to 254 wins, 195 losses, and the first two NCAA tournaments in school history.\nGene Gibson followed Robison into the position. In his eight seasons, he chalked up the second best conference record in Texas Tech history and led the Raiders to a Southwest Conference Championship in 1962. Bob Bass led the program to a 22\u201315 record over a season-and-a-half before returning to professional basketball coaching duties.\n\n1971\u20132001\nGerald Myers became coach of the Red Raiders mid-year during the 1970/71 season and stayed until 1991. His stay was the longest of any head basketball coach at Tech, and several milestones were passed during his tenure, including wins #600 (TCU), #700 (SMU), #800 (at SMU), and #900 (Texas A&M). With a Texas Tech career record of 326\u2013261, Myers has more wins with the Red Raiders than any other men's basketball coach in school history. Myers led Tech to 16 winning seasons, two Southwest Conference championships, three SWC tournament titles, and four NCAA tournament berths. Myers served as the school's athletic director from 1996 to 2011.\nJames Dickey replaced Myers as head coach prior to the 1991/92 season and would remain at Texas Tech until his dismissal at the end of the 2000/01 season. During his 10 seasons at Texas Tech, Dickey amassed a 166\u2013124 win\u2013loss record (164\u2013123 with vacated games omitted). The program also won its 1,000th game under Dickey\u2014a 71\u201362 victory at UALR.\nDickey took over a Texas Tech program that had finished with a 13\u201345 combined record over Myers' final two years and led his first team to a winning season and fifth-place finish in Southwest Conference play, after having been picked to finish last in the conference. In his second year as head coach, the Red Raiders won the Southwest Conference tournament championship, the school's fourth, to secure the league's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Texas Tech finished the 1994/95 season with a 20\u201310 record, sharing the SWC regular season championship with Texas and earning a berth in the 1995 National Invitation Tournament. In the SWC's final season, Dickey's 1995\u201396 Red Raiders produced one of the most successful seasons in school history and one of the more memorable seasons in the history of the conference, finishing 30\u20132 overall and undefeated in conference play, winning both the SWC regular season championship and the conference tournament title, advancing to the \"Sweet Sixteen\" in the NCAA Tournament, and finishing #8 in the AP poll and #10 in the Coaches' Poll.\nThe Raiders moved to the Big 12 for the 1996/97 season, and appeared to pick up right where they left off with a solid 19\u20139 season. For all intents and purposes, however, Dickey's tenure ended on the first day of the inaugural Big 12 basketball tournament. During the Raiders' first-round game, it was discovered that two players had played the entire season while academically ineligible. Hours after that game, Texas Tech announced that it was withdrawing from postseason consideration and forfeiting its entire conference schedule. The Raiders had lost that game, and would have had to forfeit it if they had won. A subsequent investigation revealed massive violations dating back to 1990 in men's basketball and nine other sports. As a result, the NCAA stripped Tech of its two NCAA tournament wins in 1996 and docked it nine scholarships over four years. Dickey was unable to recover from the lost scholarships, and his Red Raiders finished with four consecutive losing seasons, during which they only won a total of 18 games in Big 12 play. He was fired after his 2000/01 team produced a 9\u201319 overall record.\n\nBob Knight era: 2001\u20132008\nBob Knight served as the Texas Tech men's basketball head coach from 2001\u20132008.\nHired in March 2001 to replace James Dickey as head coach, Bob Knight quickly improved the program, which had not received a bid to the NCAA tournament nor achieved a winning record since 1996. Knight led the Red Raiders to three NCAA Tournament appearances and one NIT appearance in his first four years at Texas Tech, including an appearance in the Sweet Sixteen in 2005. Texas Tech finished the 2005/06 season with a 15\u201317 overall record, marking the only time that Knight finished a complete season at Tech with a losing record and fewer than 21 wins. During the 2005\u201306 season, the ESPN reality TV show centering on Knight and the Red Raiders, Knight School, was filmed. The Red Raiders recovered in 2006/07, finishing 21\u201313 and again earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament, where they would lose to Boston College in the first round. In both 2006 and 2007, Knight's Texas Tech teams defeated two top 10-ranked teams in consecutive weeks. During Knight's first six years at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders won 126 games, an average of 21 wins per season.\nOn New Year's Day 2007, Texas Tech recorded a 70\u201368 defeat of New Mexico to give Knight his 880th career victory, making him the highest winning coach in men's college basketball history.\nOn January 16, 2008, Knight registered his 900th career victory when the Red Raiders upset the ninth-ranked Texas A&M Aggies, 68\u201353. Knight won two more games as head coach\u2014against Missouri and Oklahoma State\u2014prior to announcing his retirement on February 4, 2008, after having led his 2007\u201308 team to a 12\u20138 mid-season record. His son Pat Knight, the head coach designate since 2005, was immediately named as his successor. The younger Knight stated that, after many years of coaching, his father was exhausted and ready to retire.\nBob Knight finished with an overall win\u2013loss record of 138\u201382 at Texas Tech.\n\nPat Knight era: 2008\u20132011\nAfter assuming the head coaching role midseason, Pat Knight's initial two games were defeats on the road. The first was an 80\u201374 loss to Baylor on February 6, 2008. The second came three days later at Nebraska. Knight's first head coaching win came at home when the Red Raiders upset #18 Kansas State, 84\u201375, at United Spirit Arena. Going into the game, KSU was in sole possession of first place in the Big 12. On March 1, 2008, the Red Raiders again defeated the top team in the conference by beating #5 Texas, 83\u201380, ending a month-long, eight-game winning streak for the Longhorns.\nThe Red Raiders finished the regular season with back-to-back losses, first at Kansas and then to Baylor. At the 2008 Big 12 men's basketball tournament, they added another loss\u2014to Oklahoma State\u2014in the first round. The team did not receive an invitation to play at either the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship or at the National Invitation Tournament. Texas Tech did get an invitation to the inaugural College Basketball Invitational, but declined the offer.\nIn the third game of the 2008\u201309 season, Tech defeated Division II opponent East Central 167\u2013115, setting a new school record for most points scored in a game. The previous record of 128 was set in the double overtime victory over Texas on February 20, 1994. The combined total of 282 points also became a new record.\nOn March 7, 2011, Texas Tech terminated Knight's position as head coach. He left with an overall record of 50\u201361, becoming the second coach in the school's history to depart with more losses than wins.\n\nBilly Gillispie era: 2011\u20132012\nBilly Gillispie became the head coach of the team on March 20, 2011. He only stayed for one season before resigning on September 21, 2012, in the wake of a school investigation into his treatment of his players.\n\nTubby Smith era: 2013\u20132016\nTubby Smith was hired to replace interim head coach Chris Walker on April 1, 2013, after 6 seasons as head coach of Minnesota. Smith's first season showed some signs of progress, with Texas Tech picking up its first victory over a top-25 team since 2009. Texas Tech's victory over the then #12 Baylor Bears was the first win over a ranked opponent since December 2009, when the team defeated #10 Washington. Smith would later earn another top 25 upset with a victory over #19 Oklahoma State on February 8, 2014. Following outreach by Smith and the athletic department, Texas Tech students broke both school and Big 12 Conference records for student attendance at the United Spirit Arena during a February 25, 2014, loss to Kansas State. The record of 6,086 students fell less than 2,000 short of the national record.\nThe Red Raiders ended Smith's first season with a home victory over the Texas Longhorns, but the Raiders fell to Oklahoma State in the first round of the Big 12 tournament in March. They ended the season with a 14\u201318 overall record, Smith's first losing season as a head coach. \n\nUnder Smith, the 2015\u20132016 Red Raiders finished 9\u20139 in Big 12 play and advanced to their first NCAA Tournament in nine years, earning an 8-seed in the East Regional. Their season ended in the Round of 64 with a loss to the 9-seed Butler Bulldogs.\nFollowing the season, the Smith era came to an end as Smith resigned on April 14 to coach the Memphis Tigers.\n\nChris Beard era: 2016\u20132021\nTexas Tech hired former Arkansas-Little Rock coach Chris Beard on April 15, 2016, a week after he was appointed to the same position at UNLV. In his second season at the helm, Texas Tech reached the Elite Eight for the first time in school history, with a 78\u201365 win over the Purdue Boilermakers, where they lost to the eventual national champions, the Villanova Wildcats, 71\u201359.\nWith a share of the Big 12 regular season title, the Red Raiders returned to the NCAA Tournament in 2019 as a #3 seed. Their second trip to the Elite Eight in as many years saw them defeat the #1 seed Gonzaga Bulldogs 75\u201369, clinching their first ever Final Four appearance. They proceeded to defeat the Michigan State Spartans 61\u201351, reaching their first-ever national title game, where they ultimately lost to another #1 seed, the Virginia Cavaliers, 85\u201377 in overtime, ending the most successful season in school history.\nBeard departed the program after the 2020\u201321 season, to take the head coaching job at his alma mater, the University of Texas. Given the rivalry between the two schools, Texas Tech athletic director Kirby Hocutt later remarked, \"Had he gone to any other university, he'd be celebrated. But there's just certain things you cannot do, and one of them is you can't leave Texas Tech for Texas.\"\n\nMark Adams era: 2021\u20132023\nMark Adams, a Texas Tech alumnus and longtime coach around West Texas who had served as Beard's assistant for the last six seasons, was elevated to head coach on April 5, 2021. The Dustin R. Womble Basketball Center, a new 58,000-square foot, $32.2 million practice facility for the men and women's basketball teams, was inaugurated a month later. Coach Adams swept former coach Chris Beard and the University of Texas in his first season at the helm. \nOn March 5, 2023, Texas Tech University announced that they suspended Coach Adams for using \"racially insensitive\" terms and possibly spitting on a player; Corey Williams led the team in the Big 12 tournament. On March 8, Adams resigned his position.\n\nGrant McCasland era: 2023\u2013Present\nOn March 31, 2023, Grant McCasland was hired as the 19th head coach of the Red Raiders. He had previously been the head coach of North Texas. Previously, he worked as the Director of Basketball Operations at Texas Tech from 1999-2001. He also earned his master's degree from Texas Tech in 2001. In Coach McCasland's first season, he notched a 23-11 record including a berth to the NCAA Tournament. The Red Raiders were upset in the first round by NC State.\nIn 2024\u201325, McCasland guided the Red Raiders to a top-10 AP ranking and a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament. The Red Raiders advanced to their third Elite Eight as a program and their first under a coach not named Chris Beard.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Red Raiders have appeared in the NCAA tournament 20 times. However, their 1996 appearance was vacated. Their combined record is 22\u201321 (20\u201320 without vacated games).\nOn April 6, 2019, Texas Tech earned their first trip to the NCAA tournament championship game with a Final Four win over Michigan State. Two days later, the Red Raiders lost the NCAA tournament championship game in overtime 85\u201377 to Virginia.\n\nNIT results\nThe Red Raiders have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) four times. Their combined record is 6\u20134.\n\nNAIA tournament results\nThe Red Raiders have appeared in the NAIA tournament two times.

Since their inaugural season, the Blazers have made 17 appearances in the NCAA men's basketball tournament, and 13 appearances in the National Invitational Tournament.  UAB has been productive in its NCAA tournament appearances, reaching the Elite Eight once, and the Sweet Sixteen 3 times.

  "UCF Knights": {
    "biography": "The UCF Knights men's basketball team represents The University of Central Florida, located in unincorporated Orange County, Florida near Orlando, United States. UCF competes in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the Big 12 Conference. The Knights play their home games in the Addition Financial Arena located on the university's main campus. They are coached by Johnny Dawkins who was hired in 2016.\nThe Knights have appeared in the NCAA Division II Tournament six times (1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982), including the Final Four in 1978. UCF has reached the NCAA Division I Tournament five times (1994, 1996, 2004, 2005, and 2019). UCF has won seven regular season conference championships and five conference tournament championships.\n\nHistory\nUCF played its first intercollegiate basketball game before the team even had a nickname. In the Division II era, under Torchy Clark, UCF found great success including a DII Final Four appearance. UCF has competed in the Atlantic Sun Conference (formerly called the Trans American Athletic Conference), from 1992 until 2005, when all sports joined Conference USA. Prior to 2013\u201314 all UCF sports joined the American Athletic Conference for its inaugural season. As a Division II team, the Knights had been a charter member of the Sunshine State Conference from 1975 to 1984. The Knights also had a brief one-year stint in the Sun Belt Conference.\n\nHead coaches\nUCF has had seven head coaches since organized basketball began in 1969. The Knights have played nearly 1,200 games in their 44 seasons. In that time, four coaches have led the Knights to the postseason: Torchy Clark, Kirk Speraw, Donnie Jones, and Johnny Dawkins. Clark in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, and 1982, Speraw in 1994, 1996, 2004, and 2005, and Jones in 2011 and 2012. Clark is the only coach to successfully lead the Knights past the first round of the NCAA tournament, reaching the 1978 Final Four following a 24\u2013game winning streak. Speraw is the longest tenured coach in program history at 17 seasons. Clark remains the winningest coach in school history with 274 wins in 14 seasons. Donnie Jones, who was hired in 2010 was fired by UCF on March 10, 2016. Johnny Dawkins, who was fired by Stanford, was hired on March 22, 2016. In Dawkins\u2019 first season, he led the Knights the NIT semifinals at Madison Square Garden. In 2018\u201319, Dawkins\u2019 UCF team earned the program's first at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and then won the program's first NCAA Tournament game, defeating VCU in the first round.\n\nClark era\nEugene \"Torchy\" Clark, served as FTU's, then UCF's, first head basketball coach. In 1969, Clark, who was a Wisconsin high school coach, was responsible for starting the university's basketball program from scratch. The creation of the program had only been approved by the Florida Board of Regents five months prior to his hire. That year, as a club level team, the Knights went 11\u20133, including a 99\u201338 victory in their first game over Massey Tech. The first season would serve as an omen for UCF basketball, with Clark bringing the university unprecedented success as a Division II team. Roaming the sidelines for 14 seasons, Clark never had a losing season, and built UCF into a national power, bringing the Knights five Sunshine State Conference regular season championships, one conference tournament championship and six NCAA tournament appearances in eight years. In 1978, Clark led the Knights, which at the time were riding a 24\u2013game winning streak, to the Final Four in Minnesota. During his tenure, the Knights were ranked in the top 10 nationally for seven consecutive years.\nClark earned Sunshine State Coach of the Year honors four times and won the conference's coach of the decade award. While at UCF, Clark coached both of his sons, Bo and Mike. All three men are members of the UCF Athletic Hall of Fame, and Clark is a member of the Sunshine State Conference Hall of Fame. Bo is the Knight's all-time leading scorer with Mike second on the list, and as a freshman in 1976 Bo was the nation's leading scorer. The father-son duo were featured in a 1979 Sports Illustrated issue.\nOn February 26, 1983, Clark coached his last game as a Knight, with UCF falling to Florida Southern. During his tenure, Clark's squads went 274\u201389 (.754), winning 20 or more games in a year on seven occasions. Clark enjoyed a 71\u201313 (.845) record in the Sunshine State Conference. In the decade after Clark retired, the Knights had only one winning season, the year after he left.\n\nLost decade: Machock, Carter and Dean\nReplacing the legendary Torchy Clark would prove impossible for his successors. The three men that would replace him, went a combined 96\u2013180 (.347) in 10 seasons, including only one season with a winning record. Hired to be Clark's replacement, Chuck Machock, an assistant coach at Ohio State, took the helm for the 1983\u201384 season. That year, Machock led the Knights to a 15\u201313 record, earning the team's sixth Sunshine State Conference regular season championship in their final year in the conference. The next year, UCF ascended to the ranks of Division I, earning a 10\u201318 record under Machock in what would be the Knights first losing season, and Machock's final season with the team. In two seasons, Machock led the Knights to a 25\u201331 (.446) record.\nFollowing their first losing season, the Knights hired Phil Carter. Carter would coach the Knights for four years, earning a 34\u201376 (.309) record. In his first year with the team, the Knights suffered a disappointing 6\u201322 record. The next year, Carter engineered one of the top improvements in the nation, leading UCF to a 12\u201315 campaign. From there the club would falter under his lead, earning 9 and 7 win seasons respectively. Carter finished his tenure without a winning season, manufacturing a 34\u201376 (.309) record.\nComing from Birmingham-Southern, coach Joe Dean replaced Carter. Dean led the Knights through a tumultuous four-year period, with two conference affiliation changes. In his second year with the team, UCF joined the American South Conference, the team's first affiliation since joining Division I.  The next year the conference became the Sun Belt Conference, and the next year the Knights joined the Atlantic Sun Conference. In 1991, the Knights moved from their original home-court, which was in the education building, to their new court inside what's now known as \"The Venue\"  In their last game in the education gymnasium, the team lost to Louisiana-Lafayette 85\u201394 on February 23, 1991. On November 30, 1991, the Knights posted an 82\u201374 victory over Campbell in their first game in the new arena.  In his four seasons with the Knights, Dean earned a 37\u201373 (.336) record. Like his predecessor, Dean did not enjoy a single winning season during his tenure.\n\nSperaw era\nFollowing the departure of Joe Dean, on July 28, 1993, Kirk Speraw, an assistant coach at Florida, was hired as the Knights new head coach. During his 17-year tenure, Speraw led the Knights to four Atlantic Sun Conference tournament champions, one regular season championship, and their first four NCAA tournament appearances (94, 96, 04, 05).\nWhen Speraw took the helm in 1993, UCF had only one winning season since Torchy Clark left a decade earlier. In his first year with the team, Speraw led the Knights to an 11-game turnaround (21\u20139), earning the team their first Division I NCAA Tournament Appearance. After a down 1994\u20131995 season, Speraw once again led the Knights to an NCAA Tournament appearance in 1996 despite their 8\u201318 regular season record (tied for the worst regular season record of any NCAA Division I Tournament team ever) after winning the TAAC Tournament as massive underdogs, their second NCAA Tournament appearance in his first three years. In the team's last two years in the Atlantic Sun Conference, the Knights won both the 2004 and 2005 conference tournaments, and were the 2005 regular season champions as well. Despite their success, the Knights have never progressed past the first round of the NCAA tournament as a Division I team. UCF made its debut in Conference USA in 2005, and the team earned a berth in the Conference USA Championship Tournament in their first year. The Knights would fall to Houston in the second round and close out the season with the program's first losing record (14\u201315) since 2000\u20132001. The Knights made a huge turnaround in the 2006\u201307 season, finishing 2nd in conference play to Memphis with an overall record of 22\u20139. Speraw won 2007 Conference USA Coach of the Year honors.\nThe Knights would play their first game in the new UCF Arena on November 3, 2007, an 86\u201378 win over the Saint Leo Lions.  In their first regular-season game in the new arena, the Knights would win 63\u201360 over the Nevada Wolf Pack, on November 11, 2007. In thrilling fashion, the Knights defeated the Tulsa Golden Hurricane in triple overtime 97\u201391 in front of an announced crowd of 7,097, in their first home C-USA game in the arena on January 11, 2008. In what would be his final season with the team, on February 2, 2010, the Knights defeated the East Carolina Pirates 67\u201356, earning Speraw his 275th win at UCF, passing Torchy Clark as the winningest coach in program history.\nFollowing a disappointing 2009\u201310 season in which the Knights went 15\u201317, the university decided not to retain Kirk Speraw bringing an end to his 17-year tenure. Speraw garnered a school-high 279 wins (on 233 losses\u2013.544), including 118\u201390 (.567) in the Atlantic Sun and 40\u201338 (.512) in Conference USA.\n\nJones era\nOn March 30, 2010, UCF announced Donnie Jones as the university's new Men's Basketball Head Coach. On December 1, 2010, the Knights upset the #16 Florida Gators 57\u201354 giving the Knights their first victory over a top 20 opponent as well as their first victory over the Gators. Following a 10\u20130 start to the 2010\u201311 season, the Knights were nationally ranked for the first time in program history at the Division I level. At the time, UCF was one of nine unbeaten teams, and one of only four schools to be ranked in the BCS standings and the AP basketball poll. The Knights would continue to start the season 14\u20130, their best start since moving to Division I, ranking as high as #18, and would open conference play with a defeat of Jones' former team, the Marshall Thundering Herd. UCF would finish the season 21\u201312 (6\u201310), with an appearance in the College Basketball Invitational.\nJones led the Knights to the biggest win in program history, when on November 25, 2011 they defeated the defending national champions and then-ranked #4 Connecticut Huskies 68\u201363 in the inaugural Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. Jones would lead the Knights to a 22\u201311 record in 2012, including the programs first ever NIT berth.\n\nRecruiting scandal\nFollowing an investigation into recruiting violations in the men's basketball program in 2011, on July 31, 2012, the NCAA announced sanctions \u2013 in addition to penalties UCF self-imposed. The NCAA imposed a one-year postseason ban on the program. The penalty is in addition to a $50,000 fine, adding two years to UCF's previously proposed three years' probation, reduction of basketball scholarships, and the vacating of 53 basketball victories for three seasons in which there was an ineligible player. Despite the sanctions, Jones led the Knights to their third consecutive twenty-win season in 2013 with a 20\u201311 record. Jones was fired on March 10, 2016, leaving with a 100\u201388 record at UCF.\n\nDawkins era\nFormer Stanford coach Johnny Dawkins replaced Jones as head coach on March 22, 2016.\nThe Knights made it back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005 during the 2018\u20132019 season after going 24\u20138, which included an upset win over #9 Houston breaking their 33-game home winning streak. UCF won its first NCAA Tournament game on March 22, 2019 by beating VCU in the first round.\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA Division I tournament results\nThe Knights have appeared in five NCAA Division I Tournaments. Their combined record is 1\u20135.\n\nNCAA Division II tournament results\nThe Knights appeared in the NCAA Division II Tournament six times. Their combined record was 6\u20139.\n\nNIT results\nThe Knights have made four appearances in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). Their combined record is 4\u20134.\n\nCBI results\nThe Knights have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational (CBI). Their record is 2\u20131.\n\nCBC results\nThe Knights have appeared in the College Basketball Crown once.  Their overall record is 3\u20131.\n\nHome courts\nThe Knights have taken the hardwood in three venues, all of which are still standing on UCF's main campus.\n\nThe Knight's first permanent home was in the College of Education's gymnasium. Seating under 1,000, this court served the team for over 20 years. The UCF Arena, now known as the Venue, broke ground in 1990 and opened for play in 1991. The Knights played their final season in the venue in 2007, going 15\u20131 at home only losing to the Elite Eight bound Memphis Tigers. The final game saw UCF defeating East Carolina 77\u201364 in front of 3,725 people. UCF averaged a then-school record 2,706 average attendance during the season.\nUCF moved into its new home for the 2007\u20132008 season, the 10,000 seat CFE Arena. The Knights opened up their new arena against the reigning Western Athletic Conference champion Nevada Wolf Pack on November 11, 2007 in front of a crowd of 4,668. The attendance record in the new Arena is 10,011, which was against the Illinois Fighting Illini.\n\nTraditions\nKnightmare\nWhen the basketball program moved into the New UCF Arena in the fall of 2007, the facility could hold more students than ever before. To go along with its new facility and its new commitment to basketball, a new student section was formed. The \"Knightmare\" debuted on January 11, 2008. Adorned in their black Knightmare shirts, the students completely filled the bleachered section behind the basket and the overflow section in the upper deck. In what will go down as one of the greatest basketball games in UCF basketball history, the Knights defeated Tulsa 97\u201391 in triple overtime in front of a then-record crowd of 7,097 fans.\nOne of UCF's most unusual basketball traditions is its free throw chant. Started by the \"Kirk's Jerks\" in the 1990s, UCF fans started holding their right arms with clenched fists almost straight up when a UCF player shoots a free throw. When the basketball is made, the fans would stomp their right foot twice, clap their hands twice, make a shooting motion with their right hand while chanting \"woosh.\" In the more recent years, after the appropriately named Stomp Stomp, Clap Clap, Woosh chant, fans will chant U-C-F afterwards, making a U, a C, and an F over their heads. During the 2010\u20132011 season, a group of students attempted to start a new tradition; if a UCF player makes all of his free throws, the chant is followed by \"ballin'.\"\n\nNotable alumni\nRetired numbers\nKnights in the NBA\nJoey Graham (Toronto Raptors, Denver Nuggets, and Cleveland Cavaliers)\nStephen Graham (Houston Rockets, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers, Charlotte Hornets, and Brooklyn Nets)\nMark Jones (Orlando Magic)\nStan Kimbrough (Detroit Pistons and Sacramento Kings)\nJermaine Taylor (Houston Rockets and Sacramento Kings)\nMatt Williams (Miami Heat)\nTacko Fall (Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers)\nBrandon Goodwin (Denver Nuggets, Atlanta Hawks, and Cleveland Cavaliers)\nTaylor Hendricks  (Utah Jazz)\n\nNBA draft selections\nThere have been four former UCF players selected in the NBA draft:\n\nBennie Shaw (1976, 9th round 146th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks)\nJoey Graham (2005, 1st round 16th overall by the Toronto Raptors)\nJermaine Taylor (2009, 2nd round 32nd overall by the Washington Wizards)\nTaylor Hendricks (2023, 1st round 9th overall by the Utah Jazz)\n\nKnights in overseas leagues\nChad Brown (born 1996), basketball player in the Israeli Basketball Premier League\nAubrey Dawkins, basketball player in the Turkish Basketbol S\u00fcper Ligi\nKeith Clanton, basketball player in the Romanian Liga Na\u021bional\u0103 league\nDarius Perry, basketball player in the Hungarian Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I/A league\nMatt Milon, basketball player in the Swiss Basketball League\nIsaiah Sykes, basketball player recently playing for the West Asian club Al Sulabikhat\nA.J.

    "biography": "The UCLA Bruins men's basketball program represents the University of California, Los Angeles, in the sport of men's basketball as a member of the Big Ten Conference. Established in 1919, the program has won a record 11 NCAA titles. Coach John Wooden led the Bruins to 10 national titles in 12 seasons, from 1964 to 1975, including seven straight from 1967 to 1973. UCLA went undefeated a record four times (1964, 1967, 1972, and 1973). Coach Jim Harrick led the team to another NCAA title in 1995. Former coach Ben Howland led UCLA to three consecutive Final Four appearances from 2006 to 2008. As a member of the AAWU, Pacific-8 and then Pacific-10, UCLA set an NCAA Division I record with 13 consecutive regular season conference titles between 1967 and 1979 which stood until tied by Kansas in 2017. In 2024, UCLA departed the Pac-12 Conference and joined the Big Ten Conference on August 2, 2024.\n\nNCAA records\nUCLA men's basketball has set several NCAA records.\n\n11 NCAA titles\n7 consecutive NCAA titles (1967\u20131973)\n13 NCAA title game appearances*\n10 consecutive Final Four appearances (1967\u20131976)\n25 Final Four wins*\n38 game NCAA Tournament winning streak (1964\u20131974)\n134 weeks ranked No. 1 in AP Top 25 Poll\n54 consecutive winning seasons (1949\u20132002)\n88 game men's regular season winning streak (1971\u20131974)\n4 undefeated seasons (1964, 1967, 1972, 1973)\n13 straight conference championships (Tied with Kansas)\n* 1980 tournament final vacated by NCAA\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1919\u20131948)\nIn 1919, Fred Cozens became the first head coach of the UCLA basketball and football teams. Cozens coached the basketball team for two seasons, finishing with an overall record of 21\u20134. Caddy Works was the head coach of the Bruins from 1921 to 1939, guiding them to a 173\u2013159 record. Works was a lawyer by profession and coached the team only during the evenings. According to UCLA player and future Olympian Frank Lubin, Works was \"more of an honorary coach\" with little basketball knowledge. Dick Linthicum was UCLA's first All-American in any sport, earning selections in 1931 and 1932. Wilbur Johns was the UCLA basketball head coach from 1939 to 1948, guiding the Bruins to a 93\u2013120 record.\n\nJohn Wooden era (1948\u20131975)\nFrom 1948 to 1975, John Wooden, nicknamed the \"Wizard of Westwood\", served as UCLA's head coach. He won ten NCAA national championships in a 12-year period, including a run of seven in a row that shattered the previous record of only two consecutive titles; to this day, no other team has won more than two straight titles. Within this period, his teams won a men's basketball-record 88 consecutive games.\nPrior to Wooden's arrival, UCLA had only won two conference championships in the previous 18 years. In his first season, Wooden guided a UCLA team that had finished with a 12\u201313 record the previous year to a 22\u20137 record\u2014then the most wins in a season in program history\u2014and the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) Southern Division championship. In his second season, Wooden led the Bruins to a 24\u20137 record and the PCC championship. The Bruins would win the division title in each of the next two seasons and the conference title in the latter season. Up to that time, UCLA had won only two division titles since the PCC began divisional play, and it had not won a conference title of any kind since winning the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1927.\nIn 1955\u201356, Wooden guided the Bruins to their first undefeated PCC conference title and a 17-game winning streak that only came to an end in the 1956 NCAA Tournament at the hands of a University of San Francisco team that featured Bill Russell. However, UCLA was unable to maintain this level of performance over the immediate ensuing seasons, finding itself unable to return to the NCAA Tournament as the Pete Newell-coached California teams took control of the conference at the end of the decade. Also hampering the fortunes of Wooden's team during that time period was a probation imposed on all UCLA sports in the aftermath of a scandal involving illegal payments made to players on the school's football team, along with USC, Cal and Stanford, resulting in the dismantling of the PCC conference.\n\nBy 1962 the probation was no longer in place and  Wooden had returned the Bruins to the top of their conference (now the Pac-12 Conference). This time, however, they would take the next step, and go on to unleash a run of dominance unparalleled in the history of college sports. A narrow loss due largely to a controversial foul call in the semifinal of the 1962 NCAA Tournament convinced Wooden that his Bruins were ready to contend for national championships.  Two seasons later, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when assistant coach Jerry Norman persuaded Wooden that the team's small-sized players and fast-paced offense would be complemented by the adoption of a zone press defense.  The result was a dramatic increase in scoring, giving UCLA a powerhouse team led by Walt Hazzard and Gail Goodrich that went undefeated on its way to the school's first basketball national championship.\nWooden's team repeated as national champions the following season before the squad fell briefly in 1966 when it finished second in the conference to Oregon State. UCLA was ineligible to play in the NCAA tournament that year because in those days only conference champions went to the tournament. However, the Bruins' incarnation returned with a vengeance in 1967 with the arrival of sophomore All-America and MVP Lew Alcindor. The team reclaimed not only the conference title but the national crown with an undefeated season.\nIn January 1968, UCLA took its 47-game winning streak to the Astrodome in Houston, where Alcindor, below par with an injured eye,  squared off against Elvin Hayes in the Game of the Century, which was the nation's first nationally televised regular season college basketball game. Houston upset UCLA 71\u201369 behind Hayes' 39 points. In a post-game interview, Wooden stated, \"We have to start over.\" They did, and went undefeated the rest of the year, avenging Houston 101\u201369 in the semi-final rematch of the NCAA tournament en route to the national championship. Hayes, who had been averaging 37.7 points per game, was held to only 10 points. Wooden credited Norman for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained the Houston center.\n\nThe emergence of the Bruins under Wooden vastly increased the program's popularity.  Since 1932, the Bruins had played at the Men's Gym.  It normally seated 2,400, but had been limited to 1,500 since 1955 by order of the city fire marshal.  This forced games to be moved to Pan Pacific Auditorium, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and other venues around Los Angeles when larger crowds were expected\u2014an increasing inconvenience since the Bruins' first national title.  At Wooden's urging, a much larger on-campus facility was built in time for the 1965\u201366 season, the nearly 13,000 seat Pauley Pavilion.\nWooden coached his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, when UCLA trounced Stanford 93\u201359. Four weeks later, following a 75\u201374 overtime victory over Louisville in the 1975 NCAA Tournament semifinal game, Wooden announced that he would retire at age 64 immediately after the championship game. His legendary coaching career concluded triumphantly, as his team responded with a win over Kentucky to claim Wooden's first career coaching victory over the Wildcats and his unprecedented 10th national championship in a twelve-year span.\nDuring his tenure with the Bruins, Wooden became known as the \"Wizard of Westwood\", although he personally disdained the nickname. He gained lasting fame at UCLA by winning 620 games in 27 seasons and 10 NCAA titles during his last 12 seasons, which included seven in a row from 1967 to 1973. His UCLA teams also had a then-record winning streak of 88 games and four perfect 30\u20130 seasons. They also won 38 straight games in NCAA Tournaments and 98 straight home game wins at Pauley Pavilion. Wooden was named NCAA College Basketball's \"Coach of the Year\" in 1964, 1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. In 1967, he was named the Henry Iba Award USBWA College Basketball Coach of the Year. In 1972, he shared Sports Illustrated magazine's \"Sportsman of the Year\" award with Billie Jean King. He was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973, becoming the first to be honored as both a player and a coach.\n\nAssociation with Sam Gilbert\nDuring Wooden's time at UCLA, and after his retirement in 1975, he faced criticism for the program's relationship with local businessman and booster Sam Gilbert, known by many of Wooden's players as \"Papa Sam.\" Gilbert, a multi-millionaire contractor, was known for forging close financial relationships with UCLA players, supplying them with cars, clothes, stereos, travel, and apartments, as well as allegedly arranging abortions for players' girlfriends. He represented several UCLA stars, including Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton, as an agent after they turned pro.\nA 1981 Los Angeles Times investigation, interviewing 45 people affiliated with the basketball program, revealed the extent of Gilbert's involvement, describing him as \"a one-man clearinghouse who has enabled players and their families to receive goods and services usually at big discounts and sometimes free.\" The Times investigation found that Gilbert's involvement in the program began in 1967, when UCLA stars Alcindor and Lucius Allen were considering transferring to Michigan State. They approached former UCLA star Willie Naulls, who introduced them to Gilbert. Gilbert met with the two players, and both remained at UCLA. Alcindor, later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, said later that he would have stayed regardless but called Gilbert \"like my surrogate father.\" Allen credited Gilbert with dissuading him from transferring: \"There were two people I listened to. Coach Wooden as long as we were between the lines. Outside the court \u2014 Sam Gilbert.\" Allen said Gilbert paid for multiple abortions for players' girlfriends, including one of his own. \"Everybody knew what was going on,\" UCLA player David Greenwood said. \"Nobody was so naive. It was common knowledge in the whole town.\"\nUCLA assistant Jerry Norman, who coached under Wooden from 1957 to 1968, recalled that Gilbert began \"to come around our program right when I was ready to leave. What normally happens is, alumni come to you and say, 'Coach, is there any way I can help?' Well, maybe. A lot of kids want summer jobs. But Gilbert started going behind the coaches. Alcindor calls me one day in the spring. I ask him, 'Where are you?' and he says, 'I'm in Mr. Gilbert's office.'\" In his autobiography Giant Steps, Abdul-Jabbar called Gilbert \"that odd combination, a cagey humanitarian with a lot of muscle. Guys would go to him when they were in trouble, and he would find a way to fix it...Sam steered clear of John Wooden, and Mr. Wooden gave him the same wide berth. Both helped the school greatly...once the money thing got worked out, I never gave another thought to leaving UCLA.\"\n\"The way Sam explained it to me, it was within the rules,\" Allen said in a 2007 documentary. \"But it wasn't.\" In 1973, freshman center Richard Washington told The New York Times the reason he'd chosen UCLA: \"I took a dip in Sam Gilbert's pool and it cooled me off and that was the convincer.\"\nIn 1978, NCAA field investigator J. Brent Clark testified before a Congressional subcommittee that he had begun investigating Gilbert's activities the year before but was told to back off by a superior at the NCAA, Bill Hunt. \"If I had spent a month in Los Angeles, I could have put them [UCLA] on indefinite suspension,\" Clark said later, but \"as long as Wooden was there, the NCAA would never have taken any action.\" Clark told Congress: \"The conclusion I draw is that it is an example of a school that is too big, too powerful, and too well respected by the public, that the timing was not right to proceed against them.\nWooden was aware of Gilbert's closeness with his players. In 1972, Wooden said \"I personally hardly know Sam Gilbert...I think he's a person who's trying to be helpful in every way that he can. I sometimes feel that in his interest to be helpful it's in direct contrast with what I would like to have him do to be helpful. I think he means very well and, for the most part, he has attached himself to the minority-race players. I really don't want to get involved in saying much about that, to be honest with you.\"\nDespite concerns about Gilbert, Wooden said he chose not to ask players to cut off contact, telling the Times in 1981: \"There's as much crookedness as you want to find. There was something Abraham Lincoln said \u2014 he'd rather trust and be disappointed than distrust and be miserable all the time. Maybe I trusted too much.\" The Times reporters, Mike Littwin and Alan Greenberg, concluded: \"Wooden knew about Gilbert. He knew the players were close to Gilbert. He knew they looked to Gilbert for advice. Maybe he knew more. He should have known much more. If he didn't, it was only because he apparently chose not to look.\"\nWooden did pass along his concerns to UCLA athletic director J. D. Morgan, but Morgan did not pursue the matter aggressively, in part because he believed Gilbert was connected to the Mafia. Former UCLA chancellor Charles E. Young recalled Morgan \"saying to me in that deep voice of his, 'Chuck, you don't know about Sam Gilbert. Do you want to end up on a block of concrete at the bottom of the ocean?' J. D.'s view of him was that if you cross Sam, you're likely to be killed, literally.\"\nGene Bartow, who succeeded Wooden as UCLA coach, felt similarly. In 1991, he wrote a letter to an NCAA official thanking him for suppressing Brent Clark's investigation into Gilbert. \"I want to say 'thank you' for possibly saving my life...I believe Sam Gilbert was Mafia-related and was capable of hurting people. I think, had the NCAA come in hard while I was at UCLA, Gilbert and others associated with the program would have felt I had reported them, and I would have been in possible danger...Without question, he put out some front-end money to recruits in a few cases, and I think that could have been proven.\"\nIn 1981, after Wooden's retirement, an NCAA investigation sanctioned UCLA for its relationship with Gilbert, putting the program on probation for two seasons and ordering the school to disassociate itself from him. Three players at other universities told NCAA investigators that Gilbert had offered them cars to commit to UCLA.\nIn 1987, Gilbert was indicted in Florida for conspiracy, racketeering, and money laundering as part of a drug smuggling scheme, but he died of heart failure before he could be prosecuted. His son, Michael Gilbert, was convicted on four counts in the case. Trial testimony revealed that Sam Gilbert had used Miami drug money to build The Bicycle Hotel & Casino in Bell Gardens, California.\n\nPost-Wooden era (1975\u20131988)\nFrom 1975 to 1977, Gene Bartow served as the head coach of UCLA.  He guided them to a 52\u20139 record, including a berth in the 1976 Final Four. He coached the 1977 College Player of the Year, Marques Johnson.\nGary Cunningham  became the head coach at UCLA in 1977. He coached two seasons, winning the Pacific-8 and Pacific-10 conference championships and leading UCLA to a #2 ranking in the final polls both seasons.\n\nLarry Brown then moved on to coach UCLA from 1979 to 1981, leading his freshman-dominated 1979\u201380 team to the NCAA title game before falling to Louisville, 59\u201354.  However, that runner-up finish was later vacated by the NCAA after two players were found to be ineligible. This was one of the few times a Final Four squad had its record vacated (Villanova had its runner-up finish vacated in 1971 because Howard Porter had signed a pro contract).\nLarry Farmer was the head coach of UCLA from 1981 to 1984, guiding them to a 61\u201323 (.726) record. He had recruited Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson to come play at UCLA, but then told Johnson (was drafted into the NBA in 1979) to hold off on a visit as he was more interested in Albert King. Farmer signed neither King nor Johnson, and neither recruit played for UCLA.\nIn 1984, Walt Hazzard was named the UCLA  basketball coach 20 years after he was an All-America when UCLA won its first national championship. He coached for four seasons, winning 77 out of 125 games. The 1984\u20131985 UCLA Bruin basketball team won the NIT championship. The 1986\u20131987 UCLA Bruin basketball team won both the Pac-10 regular season championship as well as the inaugural Pacific-10 Conference men's basketball tournament.\n\nJim Harrick era (1988\u20131996)\nIn 1988, Jim Harrick returned to UCLA (he had spent two years as an assistant coach from 1978 to 1979) to assume head coaching duties after the firing of Walt Hazzard. During the recruiting period before his first season, he recruited Don MacLean, the most significant recruit to commit to UCLA in several years. McLean's arrival helped start a revival of the basketball program. Within four years, the Bruins were in the Elite Eight--\"officially\" their deepest advance in the tournament in 13 years, and only the second time they had gone that far since Wooden's departure.\nDuring the 1994\u20131995 season, he led UCLA to a 32\u20131 record (a loss to California  was subsequently forfeited to the Bruins) and the school's eleventh national championship, its first since the 1974\u201375 season.  The 31 actual  wins would stand as a school record until the 2005\u201306 season. In 1996, Harrick's Bruins were upset in the first round by Princeton. Shortly before the 1997 season, UCLA fired Harrick for lying about who attended a recruiting dinner. At the time, Harrick was the second-winningest coach in school history and the only coach to achieve a National Championship at UCLA post John Wooden to date.\n\nSteve Lavin era (1996\u20132003)\nAfter the sacking of Harrick and with the departure of assistants Mark Gottfried and Lorenzo Romar for head coaching jobs shortly after the 1995 NCAA Championship season, Steve Lavin, as the assistant with the longest tenure at UCLA, was selected as interim head coach.\nLater that season on February 11, 1997, with the Bruins tied for first place in the Pac-10 with an 8\u20133 record, UCLA removed the \"interim\" tag from Lavin's title and formally named him as its 11th head coach. The Bruins then won their next 11 games en route to the Pac-10 title, before being eliminated by the Minnesota Gophers in the NCAA Midwest Regional Final. In seven seasons as head coach Lavin's record was 12\u20134 in games involving overtime. Additionally Lavin's Bruins had a 10\u20134 record against the rival USC Trojans. During the period 1997\u20132002, Lavin's Bruins compiled nine consecutive overtime victories. These included victories over Arizona, Cincinnati (2002 NCAA second round double overtime victory over No. 1 West Region seed), Kentucky, and Stanford (then ranked No 1). The Stanford win was sealed by a last second jumper by star sophomore guard JaRon Rush.\nAt UCLA from 1996 to 2003, Lavin compiled a record of 145\u201378.  As both an assistant and head coach, Lavin participated in 13 consecutive NCAA tournament appearances (1990\u20132002), while working at Purdue and UCLA. During Lavin's tenure as a head coach, he was one of only two coaches in the country to lead his team to five NCAA \"Sweet 16s\" in six years (1997, 1998, 2000\u20132002), the other coach being Duke's Mike Krzyzewski. Lavin guided UCLA to six consecutive seasons of 20 or more wins, as well as six consecutive NCAA tournament appearances.\nLavin signed seven McDonald's High School All-Americans.  Seven of Lavin's former Bruin recruits became roster members of NBA teams: Trevor Ariza, Matt Barnes, Baron Davis, Dan Gadzuric, Ryan Hollins, Jason Kapono, and Earl Watson.\nDuring Lavin's tenure as head coach, the Bruins qualified for six consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1997\u20132002). Lavin's record in the first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament is 10\u20131.  His winning percentage (90.9%) in the first two rounds is second only to Dean Smith in NCAA Tournament history. However, Lavin also coached the Bruins to their only loss in an NCAA tournament game played in the State of California (a 2002 loss to Missouri in San Jose).\nIn seven seasons as head coach Lavin's record was 12\u20134 in games involving overtime. The Bruins defeated the No. 1 team in the country in four consecutive collegiate seasons: Stanford in 2000 and 2001, Kansas in 2002 and Arizona in 2003.\nIn March 2003, following UCLA's first losing season (10\u201319) in 55 years, Lavin was fired.\nDespite some success under the watch of Steve Lavin, the program wanted to regain its position in the college basketball upper echelon. Even the success in the NCAA tournament belied the fact that UCLA had earned no better than a number 4 seed with the exception of the 1997 season.  The 2002\u201303 season turned out to be the back-breaker for Lavin as the Bruins stumbled to a 10\u201319 record and a 6\u201312 record in the conference.  It was the first losing season for UCLA in over five decades.  Lavin was dismissed following the season.\n\nBen Howland era (2003\u20132013)\nUCLA looked to find a coach that could move the Bruins back to the elite ranks of the Pac-10 and the country.  Ben Howland's success at the University of Pittsburgh and his southern California roots made him an attractive candidate.  In 2003, he left Pitt and accepted the head coaching duties at UCLA.\nHowland remedied this disappointment in his recruiting efforts.  Howland produced a top tier recruiting class from athletes in southern California that fit his Big East style.  Behind Lavin hold-over Dijon Thompson and Howland recruits Jordan Farmar and Arron Afflalo, UCLA produced a winning season for the first time in three years and returned to the tournament, where they lost in the first round.\nStarting the 2005\u201306 season with the majority of the roster made over in Howland's image and with the Lavin hold-overs (e.g.,  Ryan Hollins and Cedric Bozeman), the Bruins produced an excellent campaign.  They finished the regular season 24\u20136, winning the Pac-10 Conference title. They then roared through the Pac-10 tournament, winning each game by double digits en route to only the second Pac-10 tournament championship in school history.  The momentum continued into the NCAA tournament as the second-seeded Bruins defeated Gonzaga in the Sweet Sixteen.  They then upset top-seeded Memphis to reach the school's first Final Four in 11 years. The run ended in the championship game against Florida, whose imposing front-line proved to be a matchup problem for the Bruins.\nHowland continued his success at UCLA the following year. The Bruins finished undefeated at home for the first time in 22 years, winning the Pac-10 conference title. However they lost in their first Pac-10 tournament game and were seeded second in the NCAA Tournament West Region. After a close second-round win over Indiana, Howland led the Bruins to a win over his former team, Pitt in the Sweet Sixteen. The Bruins then again upset the top seed in the West Region, Kansas, and reached the second of UCLA's first consecutive Final Fours since the John Wooden era, only to lose again to Florida in the national semifinal.\nAt the start of the 2007\u201308 season, expectations for UCLA were the highest ever with the arrival of Kevin Love, one of the best low-post prospects in the high school class of 2007. Combined with the emergence of Russell Westbrook and Darren Collison in the back-court, the Bruins won their 3rd consecutive Pac-10 conference title, and their second Pac-10 tournament title in three years. They received their first No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament since 1995, and once again reached the Final Four, where they faced another top seed, the Memphis Tigers. Memphis got the better of the Bruins, who returned to Westwood without a championship once again.\nHowever, the Bruins program under Howland began to struggle in subsequent seasons. After 2008, UCLA did not advance past the first weekend of the NCAA tourney, and did not qualify for the tournament in 2010 and 2012. With a 77\u201373 victory over Penn on December 10, 2011; Howland passed Jim Harrick for second on UCLA's all-time wins list behind John Wooden. Nonetheless, questions about how Howland was running the program began to come into focus. In February 2012, a Sports Illustrated article portrayed UCLA player Reeves Nelson as a bully on and off the court, who at times intentionally tried to injure his teammates. According to the article, Howland looked the other way and did not discipline Nelson for over two years. From 2008\u2014the Bruins' last Final Four appearance\u2014through 2012, at least 11 players left the UCLA program.\nAlthough the 2012\u20132013 Bruins won the Pac-12 regular season championship, they quickly bowed out in the first round of the NCAA tournament. On March 25, 2013, three days after being eliminated by 11th seed Minnesota, UCLA fired Howland.\n\nSteve Alford era (2013\u20132019)\nOn March 30, 2013, Steve Alford signed a seven-year, $18.2-million contract to become the head coach of UCLA, replacing the fired Ben Howland. In his first year as head coach Alford led UCLA to a Pac-12 tournament championship, a feat not accomplished since 2008. The team later went on to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as a 4 seed in the South regional before losing to the 1 seed Florida.\nIn his second year, the team was controversially chosen to participate in the 2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as an 11 seed in the South Region, where they upset the 6 seed SMU on a game-winning goaltending call. The Bruins went on to defeat the University of Alabama at Birmingham Blazers before losing to Gonzaga in the Sweet Sixteen.\nAfter a disappointing third season in which UCLA suffered their fourth losing record since 1948, the team rebounded in the following season, going 31\u20135 before falling to Kentucky, again in the Sweet Sixteen, considered an underachievement given the talent level and overall record of the team. Freshman point guard Lonzo Ball, as well as the program in general, garnered national media attention for the outspoken behavior of his father LaVar Ball.\nPrior to the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, the team travelled to China to participate in the annual Pac-12 China Game. On November 6 in Hangzhou, during a block of free time allotted to the players, freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill shoplifted sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton department store. They were placed under house arrest by local police the next day and required to hand over their passports. The controversy garnered immense attention due to the reputation of LiAngelo as a member of the Ball family and received significant media coverage. President Donald Trump, who was concurrently visiting China, reportedly asked General Secretary Xi Jinping to pardon the three men, and they were released back to the United States shortly after, although Ball's family questioned if the President's request was a direct reason for the release. Xi himself later reportedly denied that Trump had asked him about pardoning the UCLA players and that the General Secretary had nothing to do with their release. The players were placed on suspension from basketball activities, and were eventually suspended for the entirety of the season on December 22. LaVar Ball maintained that his son had not deserved suspension; LiAngelo Ball withdrew from UCLA and signed with a sports agent, making him ineligible for further NCAA competition.\nUCLA finished the regular season in a three-way tie for third (tied with Utah and Stanford) in the Pac-12 (21\u201310, 11\u20137), disappointingly falling to St. Bonaventure in the NCAA First Four Play-in Round.  Junior  guard Aaron Holiday was named to the First-team All-Pac-12 and the Pac-12 All Defensive Team, the first player to do so in the Alford era. Holiday was drafted 23 by the Indiana Pacers in the First Round of the 2018 NBA Draft.\nUCLA started the 2018\u201319 season ranked No. 21 in the AP Poll and won seven of its first nine games. However, they concluded non-conference play with four consecutive losses, including back-to-back home losses to mid-major teams Belmont and Liberty. The 73\u201358 loss to Liberty on December 29 was UCLA's most lopsided home loss in Alford's tenure. Two days after that loss, UCLA announced that Alford had been fired and that assistant coach Murry Bartow would serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. They failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament, and ended the decade without a Final Four appearance for the first time since the 1950s.\n\nMick Cronin era (2019\u2013present)\nOn April 9, 2019, UCLA announced the hiring of Mick Cronin as the program's 14th head coach. He was named Pac-12 Coach of the Year in his first season in 2019\u201320. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pac-12 Tournament and NCAA Tournament were cancelled. The following season in 2020\u201321, the Bruins opened  the NCAA Tournament in the First Four, advancing to the Final Four after defeating No. 1 seed Michigan. No. 11 seed UCLA became the second First Four team to reach the Final Four, the school's first national semifinal since 2008, which had also been their last trip to the Elite Eight. In 2022\u201323, the Bruins received a No. 2 seed in the 2023 NCAA tournament, their highest seeding since they were placed No. 1 in 2008. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the third straight season, but losing two starters due to injuries, they were eliminated from the tournament for the second time in three years by Gonzaga.\n\nSeason-by-season results\nPostseason results\nComplete NCAA tournament results\nThe Bruins have appeared in the NCAA tournament 52 times. Their combined record is 116\u201346.\n\n*UCLA's appearances in the 1980 and 1999 tournaments were both vacated by the NCAA. Their record in the tournament excluding those two appearances is 110\u201343.\n\nNIT results\nThe Bruins have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) two times. Their combined record is 5\u20131.\n\nFacilities\nThe men's basketball team played in the 2,400 seat Men's Gym from 1932 to 1965. They also played at other venues around Los Angeles, including the Pan-Pacific Auditorium and Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, when larger crowds were expected for games.\n\nPauley Pavilion\nFollowing UCLA's second championship in 1965, the idea of constructing a new arena to accommodate increased interest in the team was proposed. In 1965, Pauley Pavilion, named for oil magnate Ed Pauley, was built on campus and has been the home of the Bruins basketball programs since that time. During the 2011\u201312 season, Pauley Pavilion underwent a complete, $136 million renovation, both inside and out, earning it the nickname of \"New Pauley.\" A new attendance record was set on March 2, 2013, when 13,727 fans watched the Bruins defeating the Arizona Wildcats 74\u201369.\n\nMo Ostin Basketball Center\nThe Mo Ostin Basketball Center  south of the Los Angeles Tennis Center and close to Pauley Pavilion, the basketball team's home court was completed in 2017 to serve as a practice facility and hub for the basketball team. On December 14, 2015, Russell Westbrook had donated a \"significant\" sum to the construction of the center, for which the facility's court was named in his honor. Westbrook's former teammate, Kevin Love, matched his contribution on September 20, 2016, for which the strength and conditioning center was named after him.\n\nCoaches\nThe team has had 12 head coaches in its history, and they have won 11 NCAA Championships, the most of any school. John Wooden won 10 national championships between 1964 and 1975, and Jim Harrick won the other in 1995. The New York Times wrote that Wooden \"made UCLA the most successful team in college basketball.\" After Wooden retired, the four coaches that succeeded him resigned, and the following three\u2014Harrick included\u2014were fired. The average tenure of those coaches after Wooden was four years. Former coach Ben Howland led the Bruins to three consecutive Final Four appearances from 2006 to 2008.\n\nRivals\nUSC\nWhen John Wooden became the coach, UCLA turned into a national basketball powerhouse. UCLA has won 11 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournaments and has dominated the conference, winning two games for every one that USC won. As of the 2013\u20132014 season, UCLA has won or shared the conference title 31 times, and USC has won or shared the title 7 times. There have been a number of significant games in this rivalry.\n\nArizona\nSince the mid-1980s, UCLA has also had a basketball rivalry with Arizona under coach Lute Olson, as the two schools competed for the Pac-10 Championship every year. Since 1985 the two teams have combined to win 27 out of the 38 conference titles. The UCLA\u2013Arizona basketball rivalry still is seen as the match up of the two premier teams in the conference. Also, the performance of the two schools influences the national opinion of the conference.\n\nNotre Dame\nUCLA had a basketball rivalry with Notre Dame that started when Digger Phelps was the Notre Dame coach and John Wooden was the UCLA coach. UCLA and Notre Dame played a home-and-home meeting for several seasons, which is otherwise uncommon outside conference play. This rivalry existed from the desire of the Notre Dame athletic department to schedule the top schools for intersectional competition. UCLA and Notre Dame played 42 times between 1966 and 1995, and the height of the rivalry was when Notre Dame ended UCLA's consecutive-game winning streak at 88 on January 19, 1974. UCLA also broke a 60-game Notre Dame winning streak in South Bend. Previous UCLA head coach Ben Howland scheduled Notre Dame four times: in 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2009. After Notre Dame's victory on December 14, 2019, UCLA leads the all-time series 29\u201321.\n\nBy the numbers\nNational titles \u2013 11\nFinal Four \u2013 19*\nElite Eights \u2013 23*\nSweet Sixteens \u2013 35*\nConference titles \u2013 31\nConference tournament titles \u2013 4\nUndefeated conference seasons \u2013 11\nUndefeated seasons \u2013 4\n20-win seasons \u2013 72\n30-win seasons \u2013 69\nWinning seasons \u2013 72\nNon-losing seasons (.500 or better) \u2013 74\nNCAA tourney bids \u2013 47\nAll-Americans \u2013 38\nAll-conference (1st team) \u2013 119\nNBA MVP winners \u2013 8\nNBA 1st round draft picks \u2013 36\nOlympians \u2013 8\nMcDonald's All-Americans \u2013 31\nNaismith Hall of Famers \u2013 9\n* Includes 1980 tournament results vacated by NCAA\n\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\nUCLA players\nAll individuals were (or will be) inducted as players unless otherwise noted.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (1995)\nDon Barksdale (2012), contributor\nGail Goodrich (1996)\nReggie Miller (2012)\nBill Walton (1993)\nJamaal Wilkes (2012)\n\nUCLA coaches\nAll individuals were inducted as coaches, though not necessarily for their service at UCLA.\n\nLarry Brown (2002)\nDenny Crum (1994)\nJohn Wooden (1972) \u2013 Also inducted separately as a player in 1961 for his career at Purdue and in early professional leagues.\n\nNotable players\nSix former UCLA Bruins went on to be named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Reggie Miller, Gail Goodrich, Jamaal Wilkes, Bill Walton and Don Barksdale. Barksdale was also notable as the first player to break many color barriers, including being the first African American to be named an NCAA All-American and NBA All-Star, and the first to be selected to the US Olympic basketball team.\nIn 2021, when the NBA named its 75th Anniversary Team, four former Bruins were included: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Reggie Miller and Russell Westbrook. UCLA is tied with the University of North Carolina for the most players on the list.\nAll 14 players who have played on three NCAA Division I Championship basketball teams are from UCLA: Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe, Lynn Shackelford, Larry Farmer, Henry Bibby, Steve Patterson, Kenny Heitz, Jon Chapman, John Ecker, Andy Hill, Terry Schofield, Bill Sweek, and Larry Hollyfield.\nUCLA became the first school to have a top winner in both basketball and football in the same year with Gary Beban winning the Heisman Trophy and Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) winning the U.S. Basketball Writers Association player of the year award in 1968.\nUCLA has produced the most NBA Most Valuable Player Award winners, six of them by Abdul-Jabbar, one to Walton, who was Abdul-Jabbar's successor, and one to Russell Westbrook. As of the 2024\u201325 NBA season, 106 former UCLA players have played in the NBA.\nAt the 2015 NBA All-Star Game and the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, former Bruins Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder was the MVP and Zach LaVine of the Minnesota Timberwolves was the winner of the Slam Dunk Contest.\n\nRetired numbers\nConsensus All-Americans\nThe following Bruins have been named consensus first-team All-Americans:\n\nSchool records\nIndividual career\nTeam season records\nCareer leaders\nUpdated through 2016\u201317 season\n\nConferences\nRecord vs. former Pac-12 opponents\nNote all-time series includes non-conference matchups and the Pac-12 Tournament.\nUpdated March 20, 2022\n\nRecord vs. Big Ten Opponents\nAll-time series includes non-conference matchups.\n\nUpdated April 4, 2024\n\nSee also\nNCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by coaches\nNCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by school\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",
    "summary": "The UCLA Bruins men's basketball program represents the University of California, Los Angeles, in the sport of men's basketball as a member of the Big Ten Conference.

    "biography": "The UConn Huskies men's basketball program is the NCAA Division I men's college basketball team of the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. They currently play in the Big East Conference and are coached by Dan Hurley. With six national championships and 45 conference titles, the program is considered one of the blue bloods of college basketball.\nUConn has won six NCAA tournament championships (1999, 2004, 2011, 2014, 2023 and 2024), which puts the program in a tie for third most all time and is the most of any program since the tournament expanded to 64 teams. The Huskies have won eight Big East tournament championships (tied for most all time) and 11 Big East regular season championships (most all time). UConn has 37 NCAA tournament appearances (tied for 11th most all time) and has played in seven NCAA Final Fours (tied for 10th most all time), 13 NCAA Elite Eights (11th most all time) and 19 NCAA Sweet Sixteens (tied for 11th most all time). UConn won the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship in 1988 and the NIT third-place game in 1997, with 13 NIT appearances in total. The Huskies also have one American Athletic Conference tournament championship and two ECAC New England regional tournament championships.\nFrom the Huskies' first game in 1900\u201301 season to the end of the 2024\u201325 season, the program has amassed 1,861 wins and compiled a .645 winning percentage, both top 25 in NCAA Division I history. Initially a New England regional powerhouse, UConn won multiple conference championships in the 1920s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including a run of 10-straight Yankee Conference championships from 1951 to 1960. The Huskies appeared in the NCAA tournament 11 times between 1939 and 1970\u2014second most of any school in the tournament's early era\u2014reaching their first Sweet Sixteen in 1956 and first Elite Eight in 1964. The program began its emergence as a national powerhouse after becoming a charter member of the newly formed Big East Conference in 1979, building steadily from its first national postseason championship in the NIT in 1988 to its first NCAA championship in 1999.\nSince 1999, the Huskies have won six national championships in a span of 25 years, one of the best runs in the sport's history. In 2024, UConn became the eighth school in NCAA Division I history to win back-to-back national championships, and the first to do so in 17 years. After the 2023\u201324 season, Fox Sports dubbed the Huskies' sustained success \"the greatest run of the 21st century\" and recognized UConn as \"one of the greatest programs in the history of college basketball.\"\n\nHistory\nEarly history (1901\u20131946)\nConnecticut Agricultural College played its first organized men's basketball game on February 8, 1901, a 17\u201312 win against Willimantic High School. The victory led the school to add men's basketball as a varsity sport the following year. The program's first intercollegiate game came in the 1904\u201305 season, a 66\u201322 loss to UMass. Connecticut did not have a home court during these early years and eventually ceased competition in 1908 as a result. An independent team was given permission to compete under the school's name from 1910 to 1914. Connecticut resumed sponsorship of men's basketball as a varsity sport in the 1914\u201315 season following the construction of Hawley Armory, the school's first on-campus basketball court. The Aggies, as they were called at the time, had no coach from 1901 to 1915 and posted a 1\u20134 record on the 1914\u201315 season.\n\n1915\u20131921: John Donahue and Ross Swartz\nLooking to improve on its performance in the previous seasons, Connecticut named John F. Donahue as the program's first head coach in 1915. However, he led the team to four losing seasons and an 11\u201323 overall record during his tenure as head coach. Connecticut named M. Ross Swartz as Donahue's replacement in 1919. He posted a 7\u20135 record in his first year\u2014the school's first winning season since returning basketball as a varsity sport\u2014but finished 7\u20139 in his second.\n\n1921\u20131922: Wilder Tasker\nWith losing records in five out of the previous six years, Connecticut finally turned the corner when it named J. Wilder Tasker as head coach for the 1921\u201322 season. The Aggies played their most aggressive schedule to date, and opened the season with a 38\u201333 win against Harvard in Cambridge. In its second game, the team notched the program's first major upset, a 33\u201331 win over Army at West Point on December 21, 1921. Army was ranked No. 3 in the nation that season by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Connecticut finished the year 15\u20134 overall, the program's best season to date. Tasker returned for the 1922\u201323 season but abruptly resigned after the team's first game, a 52\u201319 loss to Army. He left Connecticut with a 15\u20135 overall record. Roy J. Guyer coached the remainder of the season, finishing 8\u20136 as interim head coach.\n\n1923\u20131927: Sumner Dole\nConnecticut named Sumner Dole as head coach ahead of the 1923\u201324 season. After posting a losing record in his first season, Dole led Connecticut to back-to-back New England Conference championships in 1925 and 1926. Hugh Greer was captain of the 1925\u201326 team. That season included a 30\u201326 win over UMass, a team ranked No. 25 in the country that season by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll. After the 1926\u201327 season, Dole stepped down as men's basketball head coach, but continued to coach the school's football team. He finished with a 34\u201322 record over four seasons as head coach.\n\n1927\u20131931: Louis Alexander\nWith Dole shifting his focus to the school's football team, Louis A. Alexander was named Connecticut's first men's basketball-only head coach in 1927. In his first season, Alexander won the school's third New England Conference championship. That season included a 39\u201336 win over Springfield College, a team ranked No. 11 in the nation that year by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Alexander led the team to winning records again in the next two seasons before stepping down halfway through the 1930\u201331 season. He left Connecticut with a 35\u201319 overall record. Dole, who was still head coach of Connecticut's football team, coached the remainder of the men's basketball season, posting a 5\u20133 record as interim head coach and bringing his overall record to 39\u201325.\n\n1931\u20131936: John Heldman Jr.\nConnecticut named John Heldman Jr. head coach ahead of the 1931\u201332 season. Harrison \"Honey\" Fitch, the program's first African American player, joined the team in the 1932\u201333 season. Heldman made the controversial decision to bench Fitch in a game against the US Coast Guard Academy in 1934 after Coast Guard refused to play if Fitch was on the floor. Heldman coached the following year, but resigned after the first game of the 1935\u201336 season, a loss to the school's alumni. Heldman finished with a 19\u201342 overall record. J. O. Christian coached the remainder of the 1935\u201336 season, finishing with a 3\u201310 record as interim head coach.\n\n1936\u20131945: Don White\nAfter five straight losing seasons, Don White was named head coach of the Huskies for the 1936\u201337 season. Prior to arriving at UConn, White spent 12 seasons as the head coach at Washington University. He led Connecticut to an 11\u20137 record in his first year. In the 1940\u201341 season, the team went 14\u20132 and won the school's fourth New England Conference championship. One of the first true stars from Connecticut was Hartford's Bernie Fisher, who played under White. He was captain of the 1944\u201345 team, which was the first Huskies team to play a game in Madison Square Garden. That season also included a 67\u201359 win over Rhode Island, a team ranked No. 19 in the country that year by the retrospective Premo-Porretta Power Poll. White left the Huskies after eight seasons to become the head coach at Rutgers. He compiled an overall record of 94\u201359 during his time with Connecticut.\n\n1945\u20131946: Blair Gullion\nConnecticut hired Blair Gullion as White's replacement for the 1945\u201346 season. Gullion spent three seasons as head coach at Tennessee prior to World War II and took over as Connecticut's head coach after returning from his service in the war. He coached the Huskies to a 12\u20136 record in his first season. At the start of the 1946\u201347 season, Connecticut joined the newly formed Yankee Conference. Gullion left the team six games into the season to accept a position as Washington University's athletic director, finishing with a 15\u20138 overall record as head coach.\n\nHugh Greer era (1946\u20131963)\nThe modern era of UConn basketball began in 1946, when Hugh Greer became head coach after Gullion's midseason departure. Greer, a former player at the school in the 1920s, was in his second season as UConn's freshman team coach when Gullion resigned. Prior to that, Greer had coached at South Windsor's Ellsworth High School, winning five state championships between 1939 and 1945.\nLed by senior Walt Dropo, a three-sport star at the school, the Huskies started the 1946\u201347 season 4\u20132 under Gullion, with road losses to rival Rhode Island and an NYU team that appeared in the NCAA tournament the previous year. Gullion resigned after the loss to NYU. The school then asked Greer to helm the team. He led UConn to a perfect 12\u20130 mark to finish the year, giving the team an overall record of 16\u20132 on the season. This was the best single season finish in school history to that point.\nIn the 1947\u201348 season, UConn moved into a new home arena, the Storrs Cage, replacing Hawley Armory. The structure was built by salvaging parts from a World War II airplane hangar, leading to the nickname \"the Hangar.\" This facility had a capacity of 4,000 seats, allowing general admission attendance for the first time. The team's first game in the Storrs Cage was a 63\u201329 win over Maine in January 1948. The Huskies won their first Yankee Conference title at the end of that season.\nUConn made its first NCAA tournament appearance in the 1950\u201351 season, where they lost to St. John's 63\u201352 at Madison Square Garden. The Huskies finished the season with a 22\u20134 overall record. In the 1953\u201354 season, Greer famously led UConn to a 78\u201377 victory against undefeated Holy Cross, breaking the Crusaders' 47-game home winning streak and keeping them out of the NCAA tournament. Holy Cross won the NIT title a few weeks later. UConn made its second NCAA tournament appearance and finished the year with a 23\u20133 overall record after a first round loss.\nThe UConn Field House replaced the Cage as the team's home court at the start of the 1954\u201355 season. UConn defeated rival Rhode Island in resounding fashion, 116\u201377, in the field house's inaugural game on December 1, 1954. The Huskies ended the season with their first National Invitation Tournament appearance and a 20\u20135 overall record.\n\nIn the 1955\u201356 season, Greer led UConn to its third NCAA tournament appearance and its first trip to the Sweet Sixteen following an 84\u201375 win over Manhattan in the first round. The Huskies narrowly lost to Temple 65\u201359 in the East Regional semifinal game played at Madison Square Garden. UConn made five consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament between 1956 and 1960, but lost in the first round in each one.\nIn 1960\u201361, UConn unexpectedly posted the program's first losing season in 17 years. It was the only losing season of Greer's tenure. The reason for the Huskies' struggles became apparent in March 1961, when two players were questioned as part of the 1961 NCAA men's basketball gambling scandal that resulted in the arrest of 37 players from 22 schools. Team captain Pete Kelly and center Glenn Cross were ultimately found to have accepted bribes to shave points throughout the season. Greer was devastated and never recovered from the scandal.\nThe Huskies improved to winning form in the 1961\u201362 season, but finished one game behind UMass in the race for the Yankee Conference title. Greer died of a heart attack 10 games into the 1962\u201363 season. His final game was a 92\u201364 win over Maine, played at the UConn Field House on January 12, 1963. He died two days after and was replaced by assistant coach George Wigton. Wigton and the Huskies posted an 11\u20133 record through their final 14 regular season games to win the Yankee Conference title and advance to the NCAA tournament for the eighth time in program history. The team lost in the first round to West Virginia, 77\u201371.\nUnder Greer, UConn won 12 Yankee Conference titles in 16 seasons, including 10 consecutive titles from 1951 to 1960. Greer also led UConn to its first seven NCAA berths and one NIT appearance while compiling an overall head coaching record of 286\u2013112.\n\nFred Shabel era (1963\u20131967)\nUConn named Fred Shabel as Greer's permanent replacement at head coach on April 1, 1963. Shabel previously spent six seasons as an assistant coach at Duke, four of which were under College Basketball Hall of Fame coach Vic Bubas. He played a role in Duke's first Final Four run in 1963 and initially accepted an offer to coach at Rutgers the following season, but withdrew after feeling unprepared to lead their program to success. Instead, he chose to accept an offer from Connecticut, which he believed had a clear path to the NCAA tournament in the Yankee Conference.\nShabel implemented a number of changes that had a significant impact on UConn's program and its culture. He introduced multiple defensive schemes for the first time, began calling offensive sets from the bench and pushed for the creation of the UConn pep band. Unlike Greer, who remained seated during most games, Shabel often stood and walked along the sideline.\nShabel's first year at the helm was an uneven one, with a 6\u20138 record in non-conference play in the 1963\u201364 season. However, the Huskies went 8\u20132 in Yankee Conference regular season play, tying with Rhode Island atop the conference standings to claim the program's 14th Yankee Conference title. In a one-game playoff, UConn defeated Rhode Island 61\u201360 on the road to break the tie, clinching the program's ninth appearance in the NCAA tournament. In the first round, UConn avenged a regular season loss to Temple, beating the heavily favored Owls 53\u201348 in Philadelphia. They faced even more difficult matchup with Princeton in the Sweet Sixteen. Before the game, Princeton coach Butch van Breda Kolff said he was so confident in his team's ability to win that he did not watch the Huskies' game against Temple. A tightly contested game throughout, UConn's Dom Perno stole the ball from future Hall of Famer Bill Bradley in the final seconds to seal a 52\u201350 win, sending the Huskies to the Elite Eight for the first time ever. The run ended there, however, as UConn lost to Shabel's former team, Duke, by a score of 101\u201355 in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nUnder Shabel, the Huskies won four Yankee Conference championships in four years, leading to three NCAA tournament berths. By the mid-1960s, UConn had appeared in the NCAA tournament 11 times, second most in the country. After the 1966\u201367 season, Shabel stepped down as head coach to become the athletic director at Penn. He later attributed the move to the school's ambivalence about committing greater financial resources to athletics, including the administration's decision to decline an invitation to the NIT in 1966 without consulting him.\n\nBurr Carlson era (1967\u20131969)\nAfter Shabel's departure, UConn offered the head coaching job to Larry Brown, then a young assistant coach at North Carolina. Brown declined, saying he felt he was too \"young\" to take a head coaching position.\nThe job ultimately went to Burr Carlson, a former player and an assistant under Shabel. Carlson led UConn to back-to-back losing seasons for the first time in over 30 years and was fired.\n\nDee Rowe era (1969\u20131977)\nUConn named Dee Rowe head coach ahead of the 1969\u201370 season. Under Rowe, the Huskies returned to form, winning the Yankee Conference title in his first year. Rowe posted six winning seasons in eight years, with one NCAA berth and two NIT appearances. On Feb. 19, 1974, UConn became the first school in New England and one of the first in the country to start five black players in an intercollegiate basketball game. In 1976, UConn won the ECAC New England regional championship to earn an NCAA berth and then beat Hofstra in the first round of the 1976 NCAA tournament to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the fourth time ever. They ultimately lost to Rutgers in the Sweet Sixteen matchup, 93\u201379.\nAt the end of the 1975\u201376 season, the Yankee Conference dropped basketball, which left UConn as an independent. Rowe coached the Huskies' first season as an independent before retiring from coaching at 48 years old, citing heath issues at the time. He later would cite \"burn out\" as the reason for his decision.\n\nDom Perno era (1977\u20131986)\nFormer UConn star Dom Perno was tapped as Rowe's successor for the 1977\u201378 season. Perno oversaw UConn's transition from an independent program to a member of the newly formed Big East Conference in 1979, where UConn was one of the seven founding schools. Under Perno, the Huskies had some early success, winning an ECAC New England regional championship in 1979 and earning one NCAA berth (1979) and three NIT appearances over his first five years. However, after four consecutive losing seasons, Perno resigned on April 14, 1986.\n\nJim Calhoun era (1986\u20132012)\n1986\u201387 Season: Calhoun's First Year\nUConn hired Northeastern head coach Jim Calhoun to take over the program in the 1986\u201387 season. Before coming to Connecticut, Calhoun spent 14 seasons at Northeastern, leading the team to the NCAA tournament five times in his last six years with the school. In his final season, Calhoun's Northeastern team defeated UConn 90\u201373 in a game at the Hartford Civic Center.\nCalhoun inherited a team that included future NBA player Clifford Robinson. However, Robinson and fellow starter Phil Gamble were declared academically ineligible halfway through the year. Calhoun finished his first year with a record of 9\u201319 overall and 3\u201313 in Big East conference play to garner his only losing season as UConn's head coach.\n\n1987\u201388 Season: NIT Champions\nHeading into the 1987\u201388 season, Robinson and Gamble regained their academic eligibility and the team showed significant improvement. The Huskies won a game in the Big East tournament for the first time since 1980 and gained a berth in the National Invitation Tournament. UConn went on a run in the tournament and defeated Ohio State 72\u201367 at Madison Square Garden to win the NIT, the school's first national basketball title. UConn finished the season with a 20\u201314 record, its first winning season since 1981\u201382. The Huskies would ultimately achieve winning records in every season from 1987\u201388 through 2015\u201316.\n\n1989\u201390 Season: 'Dream Season', National Breakthrough\nThe 1990 \u201cDream Season\u201d brought UConn basketball back to the national stage. Led by Chris Smith, Nadav Henefeld, Scott Burrell, Tate George, and Rod Sellers, UConn went from unranked in the preseason to winning the Big East regular season and tournament championships, both for the first time. January 1990 in particular marked several major milestones for the team. After an already historic 13\u20133 start to the season, the Huskies were able to defeat No. 5 Syracuse and No. 2 Georgetown in back-to-back games played at the Hartford Civic Center. After their 70\u201365 victory over the Hoyas on January 20th, the Huskies entered the AP ranking for the first time ever at #20. 1990 also marked the opening of Gampel Pavilion, the program's new on-campus home, which opened on January 21st.\nUConn entered the Big East tournament ranked No. 8 in the nation and with a 12\u20134 record in conference play. As the #2 seed in the tournament, the Huskies handily defeated Seton Hall in the quarterfinals before capturing a 65\u201360 victory over No. 5 Georgetown the following day. On March 11, UConn defeated No. 4 Syracuse 78\u201375 in the championship game to capture their first ever Big East title, thus assuring their place in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1979.\nIn the NCAA tournament, the Huskies garnered a #1 seed in the East Region for the first time ever. They easily won their first two matches, winning both games by 20 points or more. In the Sweet Sixteen, UConn trailed #5 seeded Clemson 70\u201369 with 1 second remaining. Scott Burrell's full-court pass found Tate George on the far baseline. George spun, fired, and hit a buzzer-beater that is known in Connecticut simply as \"The Shot\". However, they would be eliminated on a buzzer-beater two days later by #3 seeded Duke in the Elite Eight, losing in overtime 79\u201378. UConn finished the season with a 31\u20136 overall record. The 1989\u201390 season ultimately marked the beginning of UConn's' sustained success in men's basketball on the national level, and the program began making regular appearances in the NCAA tournament going forward.\n\n1990s: Creation of a Basketball Powerhouse\nDuring the 1994\u201395 season, the Huskies hosted Syracuse on ESPN. During an exciting stretch of the second half of that game, ESPN color commentator Dick Vitale declared that Storrs was the \"basketball capital of the world\" as both the men's and women's teams were having undefeated seasons so far. The Huskies beat Syracuse but later lost to Kansas to end their undefeated season. UConn ultimately continued to rise as a national program throughout the 1990s, winning five Big East regular season (1990, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998) and three Big East tournament championships (1990, 1996, 1998), as well as making the Elite Eight three times (1990, 1995, 1998), prior to their 1998\u201399 National Championship season.\nOne of the most notable players of the era was future NBA legend Ray Allen, who played for the Huskies from 1993 until he was selected as the No. 5 overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft. In his junior season, Allen averaged 23.4 points, 6.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.7 steals in 34.7 minutes per game. In the 1996 Big East Championship against Georgetown, Allen made the winning shot with only 14 seconds remaining to achieve a 75\u201374 victory over the Hoyas. This game is widely considered one of the greatest in Big East tournament history, as UConn was able to end the game with a 12\u20130 run with under 5 minutes to play. Following the championship, Allen was named the Big East Player of the Year and earned first-team All-Big East for the second year in a row. The Huskies ultimately advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament that year before falling to Mississippi State, 60\u201355.\n\n1998\u201399 Season: 'We Shocked the World', 1st NCAA Title\nUConn entered the 1998\u201399 season ranked No. 2 in the AP Top 25 poll, returning its entire starting five from the previous year's Elite Eight team. Calhoun convinced leading scorer Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton to return for his junior season instead of departing for the NBA, putting the Huskies in position to make a historic run. UConn started the season 19\u20130, with wins over five ranked teams. By early December, the Huskies were ranked No. 1 in the AP poll, where they stayed for a program-record 10 weeks. The team's first loss came to No. 16 Syracuse on February 1, 1999, a 59\u201342 defeat in front of a sold-out crowd at the Hartford Civic Center. Both Hamilton and starting center Jake Voskuhl were out with injuries. UConn quickly rebounded, however, beating No. 4 Stanford 70\u201359 on the road. The Huskies finished the year ranked 1st in the Big East, winning their fifth conference regular season title in six years. On March 3, 1999, UConn defeated #3 seeded St. John\u2019s 82\u201363 to win their fourth Big East tournament championship. Kevin Freeman was named the tournament's MVP.\nThe Huskies received a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament for the third time in program history. On March 20, 1999, UConn defeated #10 seed Gonzaga 67\u201362 in the Elite Eight to advance to the program's first-ever Final Four. In the National Semifinals, the Huskies defeated #4 seed Ohio State 64\u201358 to advance to the championship game. Facing the #1 overall seed Duke, UConn was a 9.5-point underdog heading into the matchup. However, the Huskies prevailed by a score of 77\u201374 to claim the program's first-ever national championship. As time expired, Khalid El-Amin ran over to a television camera on the court and shouted, \"We shocked the world!\" Richard Hamilton was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, contributing 27 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists in the championship game. UConn finished with a 34\u20132 overall record to achieve its best seasonal winning percentage in the program's history (as of 2024). After the season, Hamilton was selected in the 1999 NBA draft as the No. 7 overall pick.\n\n2003\u201304 Season: 'Calhoun's Best Team', 2nd NCAA Title\nExpectations were high at UConn heading into the 2003\u201304 season. Returning their entire starting lineup from the previous year's Sweet Sixteen team, the Huskies were selected as the preseason No. 1 team in the AP Top 25 poll. UConn faced its first setback in the fourth game of the season, losing to Georgia Tech 77\u201361 in the Preseason NIT semifinals. However, the team responded with 11 consecutive wins, including an 86\u201359 victory over No. 7 Oklahoma at Gampel Pavilion on January 11, 2004. The streak ended with an 86\u201383 loss at No. 11 North Carolina on January 17, 2004. UConn ultimately finished the year second in the Big East, obtaining a 12\u20134 record in conference play during the regular season. In the Big East tournament, the team defeated #7 seed Notre Dame in the quarterfinals and No. 11 seed Villanova in the semifinals with relative ease. On March 13, 2004, the Huskies defeated No. 1 seed Pittsburgh 61\u201358 in a thrilling championship game to win the program's sixth Big East tournament championship. Ben Gordon scored a tournament-record 84 points over three games and was named the tournament's MVP.\nThe Huskies were awarded a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the program's second Final Four with an 87\u201371 win over #8 seeded Alabama in the Elite Eight on March 27, 2004. In the National Semifinals, UConn came back from an 8-point deficit with three minutes remaining to defeat #1 seeded Duke 79\u201378 on April 3, 2004. The Huskies won their second NCAA championship on April 5, 2004, defeating #3 seeded Georgia Tech 82\u201373 in a rematch of their regular season contest. Emeka Okafor was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and UConn finished the season with a 33\u20136 overall record. After the season, Okafor and Gordon were selected in the 2004 NBA draft as the No. 2 and No. 3 overall picks, respectively. Calhoun said he considers the 2003\u201304 team to be the best he ever coached.\nCalhoun was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\n2008\u201309 Season: 6OT Game, 3rd Final Four\nAfter steadily rebuilding over the prior two years, UConn entered the 2008\u201309 season ranked No. 2 in the preseason AP Top 25 poll. The Huskies returned their entire starting lineup from the previous season and added 2008 McDonald's All-American Kemba Walker to the roster. The team started the year 11\u20130, including double-digit wins over No. 17 Miami and No. 25 Wisconsin en route to the US Virgin Islands Paradise Jam championship. With an 88\u201383 win over No. 8 Gonzaga in Seattle on December 20, 2008, UConn earned its third ranked victory of the year ahead of conference play. The Huskies' first stumble came in their Big East opener, a 74\u201363 loss at home to No. 11 Georgetown. The team responded with 12 straight conference wins that propelled UConn to a No. 1 ranking in the AP poll by February. In mid-February, the team lost key starter Jerome Dyson to a season-ending knee injury in a 63\u201349 win against No. 23 Syracuse. UConn finished the regular season 4\u20132 without Dyson\u2014with the two losses coming against Pittsburgh, ranked top-five in both matchups.\nThe Huskies finished the year tied for second in the Big East and received the #3 seed in the conference tournament. In the Big East tournament quarterfinals, UConn lost to #6 seeded Syracuse in a six-overtime game remembered as one of the greatest college basketball games of all time. The Orange appeared to a hit a game-winning shot at the end of regulation, but the basket was waived off after review. Syracuse never led in the first five overtimes, but UConn was unable to put the game away. The Huskies went scoreless in the first two and a half minutes of the sixth overtime and fell to the Orange 127\u2013117. Despite the loss, UConn was awarded a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the program's third Final Four with an 82\u201375 win over #3 seed Missouri. The Huskies' run ended in the Final Four with an 82\u201373 loss to #2 seed Michigan State. UConn finished the season with a 31\u20135 overall record. After the season, Hasheem Thabeet and A. J. Price were selected in the 2009 NBA draft as the No. 2 and No. 52 overall picks, respectively.\n\n2010\u201311 Season: 'Cardiac Kemba', 3rd NCAA Title\nUConn entered the 2010\u201311 season unranked and picked to finish tenth in the Big East. But after a 10\u20130 start that included wins over No. 2 Michigan State and No. 8 Kentucky en route to the Maui Invitational Tournament championship, the Huskies catapulted to No. 7 in the AP Top 25 poll. The team reached No. 4 in the poll by the start of conference play and were projected to be a force to reckon with in the Big East regular season. However, the Huskies struggled against their Big East opponents, finishing the regular season in a tie for ninth place after losing four of their last five games. The team finished the regular season with a 9\u20139 record in conference play and ranked No. 21 in the AP Poll. \nIn the first two rounds of the Big East tournament, UConn defeated #16 seed DePaul and #8 seed Georgetown. In the quarterfinals, Kemba Walker hit a step-back, game-winning shot as time expired to defeat #1 seed Pittsburgh, 76\u201374. Dave Pasch immortalized the shot with his call on the ESPN broadcast: \"Cardiac Kemba does it again!\" The Huskies defeated #4 seed Syracuse 76\u201371 in overtime in the semifinals and then defeated #3 seed Louisville 69\u201366 in the championship game to claim the program's seventh Big East tournament title. UConn became the first school to win five conference tournament games in five days, and Kemba Walker scored a tournament-record 130 points. \nThe Huskies were awarded a #3 seed in the NCAA tournament and ultimately advanced to their fourth Final Four after a 65\u201363 victory over #5 seeded Arizona in the Elite Eight. They defeated #4 seeded Kentucky 56\u201355 in the Final Four and #8 seeded Butler 53\u201341 in the national championship game to capture the schools third NCAA title. Walker was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, averaging 23.5 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game throughout the season. UConn finished the season with a 32\u20139 overall record, becoming the first and (as of 2024) only men's or women's basketball team to play 41 games in one season. After the season, Walker was selected in the 2011 NBA draft as the No. 9 overall pick.\nCalhoun officially announced his retirement on September 13, 2012.\n\nKevin Ollie era (2012\u20132018)\nKevin Ollie was named UConn's next head coach at Jim Calhoun's retirement press conference in Gampel Pavilion. Ollie played for Calhoun from 1991 to 1995 before spending 13 seasons as a journeyman in the NBA. He returned to UConn in 2010 to serve as one of Calhoun's assistant coaches during the 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312 seasons.\n\n2012\u201313 Season: Ollie's First Year, Postseason Ban\nUConn came into the 2012\u201313 season facing a ban from postseason play by the NCAA because of a low APR score in 2010. In Ollie's first game, UConn upset No. 14 Michigan State 66\u201362 at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The Huskies entered the AP Top 25 at No. 23 and reached No. 21 the following week. After a 4\u20130 start, they fell out of the poll for the remainder of the year following a 66\u201360 loss to New Mexico in the Paradise Jam championship game. The season featured wins at No. 17 Notre Dame and against No. 6 Syracuse at the XL Center, as well as a double-overtime loss to No. 7 Georgetown at Gampel Pavilion. UConn finished the season with a 20\u201310 overall record. Due to their postseason ban, the Huskies were unable to participate in the Big East Tournament, nor were they able to qualify for the NCAA Tournament.\nConference realignment resulted in the breakup of the old Big East at the end of the 2012\u201313 season. Instead of leaving with the so-called Catholic 7 schools, UConn chose to remain a member of the original Big East's legal successor, later named the American Athletic Conference. Until leaving the American in 2020 to join the new Big East, UConn was the only charter member of the original Big East still playing in the conference.\n\n2013\u201314 Season: 'Hungry Huskies', 4th NCAA Title\nThe Huskies came into Ollie's second season ranked No. 18 in the AP Top 25 poll. They started the year 9\u20130, which included a 59\u201358 win over Indiana in the 2K Sports Classic championship game and a 65\u201364 win over No. 15 Florida on a buzzer-beater from Shabazz Napier. UConn climbed to No. 10 in the AP poll before losing its first game to Stanford on December 18, 2013. The team finished the year tied for third in the inaugural season of the American Athletic Conference and advanced to the AAC tournament championship game, where they lost by 10 points to No. 5 Louisville. UConn was selected to the NCAA Tournament as a #7 seed and then defeated #10 seed St Joseph\u2019s in overtime, #2 seed Villanova, and #3 seed Iowa State in the Sweet 16 to advance to the regional final. On March 30, 2014, Kevin Ollie became the first UConn coach other than Jim Calhoun to lead the Huskies to a Final Four after defeating #4 seed Michigan State 60\u201354 in the Elite Eight. The Huskies beat the #1 overall seed Florida 63\u201353 in the Final Four and then won the national championship on April 7, 2014, defeating #8 seed Kentucky, 60\u201354.\nShabazz Napier was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player and in his postgame remarks called out the NCAA for the previous year's postseason ban: \"You're looking at the hungry Huskies. This is what happens when you ban us.\" Other major contributions to the team's unexpected tournament run came from point guard Ryan Boatright, who averaged over 12 points and 3.5 rebounds per game throughout the season, and small forward DeAndre Daniels. Ollie's team was the first #7 seed to ever win the NCAA tournament. UConn finished the season with a 32\u20138 overall record. After the season, Napier and Daniels were selected in the 2014 NBA draft as the No. 24 and No. 37 overall picks, respectively.\n\n2014\u201315 Season: AAC Final Loss, No NCAA Bid\nDespite losing four of its top five scorers from the previous year, UConn entered the 2014\u201315 season ranked No. 17 in the AP Top 25 poll. The Huskies started the year 3\u20130, but fell out of the top 25 amid a three-game losing streak to West Virginia, No. 7 Texas and Yale\u2014the last two of which were 1-point losses on last-second shots by the opponent. UConn was eventually able to gain some momentum near the end of conference play, defeating No. 21 SMU at the XL Center on March 1, 2015. However, the team then went on to lose their final two games of the regular season.\nUConn finished the regular season tied for fifth in the American. In the AAC tournament quarterfinals, Ryan Boatright hit a game-winning 3-point shot against No. 3 seed Cincinnati as time expired. The team advanced to the conference championship game for the second straight year after a win over #2 seed Tulsa in the semifinals. However, UConn lost to #1 seed SMU 62\u201354 in the championship and missed the NCAA tournament as a result. The season ended with a first-round exit in the NIT, losing to Arizona State 68\u201361 in a game played at Gampel Pavilion. UConn ultimately finished the season with a 20\u201315 overall record.\n\n2015\u201316 Season: AAC Champions\nUConn entered the 2015\u201316 season ranked No. 20 in the AP Top 25 poll. The Huskies started 4\u20130 and climbed to No. 18 in the poll. However, they dropped three of their next four, losing to Syracuse, No. 10 Gonzaga, and No. 6 Maryland, and fell out the top 25. The team bounced back and briefly re-entered the top 25 in mid-December. They would again re-enter the top 25 in January before falling out for the remainder of the year. UConn posted an 11\u20137 record in conference play, narrowly missing a three-way tie for third place at 12\u20136 in the American. Instead, the Huskies finished sixth, but received the #5 seed in the tournament because SMU was ineligible for postseason play.\nIn one of the program's most memorable postseason games, UConn defeated #4 seed Cincinnati 104\u201397 in quadruple overtime the AAC tournament quarterfinals. Down by 3 with 0.6 seconds left on the clock in the third overtime, Jalen Adams hit a three-quarter court shot to force the fourth and final overtime. UConn then defeated #1 seed Temple in the semifinals and #6 seed Memphis in the championship game to win the American Athletic Conference tournament championship. Daniel Hamilton was named the conference tournament's MVP. UConn returned to the NCAA tournament at a No. 9 seed and defeated #8 seed Colorado 74\u201367 in the Round of 64. However, the Huskies were eliminated by the #1 overall seed Kansas Jayhawks 73\u201361 in the Round of 32. UConn finished their season with a 25\u201311 overall record. After the season, Hamilton was selected as the No. 56 overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft.\n\n2016\u201317 Season: Ollie's First Losing Season\nDespite losing their MVP in Daniel Hamilton, UConn entered the 2016\u201317 season ranked No. 18 in the AP Top 25 poll. However, they fell out of the rankings after opening the year with upset losses at home to Wagner and Northeastern. On December 5, 2016, the Huskies defeated Syracuse 52\u201350 in the Tire Pro Classic at Madison Square Garden. This win gave the team some confidence after a disappointing 3\u20134 start to the season. However, without their previous season's MVP in Daniel Hamilton, UConn would continue to struggle against their AAC opponents going forward, losing four out of their last five games in AAC play.\nThe team finished the regular season tied for fifth place in the American with a 9\u20139 record in conference play, and were given the #6 seed in the conference tournament. The Huskies managed to pull off an upset win over #3 seed Houston in the AAC tournament quarterfinals, but lost in the semifinals to #2 seed Cincinnati the following day. UConn finished with a 16\u201317 overall record, the program's first losing season in 30 years.\n\n2017\u201318 Season: Consecutive Losing Seasons\nThe Huskies were unranked for the entire 2017\u201318 season and had 11 double-digit losses. On January 26, 2018, the school announced the NCAA was investigating UConn for possible recruiting violations related to three players. The team finished the regular season tied for eighth place in the American (7\u201311 record in AAC play) and lost to #9 seed SMU 80\u201373 in the first round of the conference tournament on March 8, 2018. UConn finished with a 14\u201318 overall record in what is widely considered to be the teams worst-performing season since the Jim Calhoun era began in 1986. Two days after the loss to SMU, Kevin Ollie was fired for just cause related to the NCAA investigation. \nIn Ollie's final season, UConn men's basketball game attendance reached its lowest level in nearly 30 years, illustrating the severe decline in its prominence and performance since the program's 2014 National Championship.\nOn July 2, 2019, the NCAA announced UConn's wins for the 2017\u201318 season would be vacated because of the school's recruiting violations, giving the school a 0\u201318 official record for the year.\n\nDan Hurley era (2018\u2013present)\nUConn hired Rhode Island head coach Dan Hurley as Ollie's replacement for the 2018\u201319 season. He was introduced on March 23, 2018. Prior to his six seasons at Rhode Island, Hurley spent nine years coaching at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in New Jersey and two years at Wagner College. His father is Bob Hurley Sr., a longtime New Jersey high school basketball coach and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, and his brother is Bobby Hurley, two-time national champion as a player and current head coach at Arizona State.\n\n2018\u201319 Season: Hurley's First Year\nHurley's first season at UConn was an up-and-down affair. The first marquee win under Hurley came in his third game when the Huskies defeated No. 15 Syracuse 83\u201376 in the 2K Sports Classic semifinals at Madison Square Garden. This win was the programs first top 15 victory since the 2014 NCAA tournament. However, UConn lost to Iowa the following day in the tournament championship game and continued to struggle heavily throughout the season against quality opponents. The team ultimately garnered a 6\u201312 record in the American Athletic Conference, its worst record in conference play in over three decades. The Huskies were given a #9 seed in the AAC tournament, and their season ended with an 84\u201345 loss to #1 seed Houston in the quarterfinals. While UConn's 16\u201317 record was an improvement from the previous year, it marked the third-straight losing season for the program.\nOn June 27, 2019, UConn and the Big East announced that the school would return to the conference for the 2020\u201321 season.\n\n2019\u201320 Season: Final Year in the AAC\nWith UConn's return to the Big East imminent, the Huskies had one season left to play in the American Athletic Conference. The team gained a 4-star recruiting class that included future First-team All-Big East guard James Bouknight, as well as transfer point guard R. J. Cole. UConn started the year 9\u20133, including an upset win over No. 15 Florida at Gampel Pavilion on November 17, 2019. In one of the most memorable games of the year, the Huskies lost 75\u201374 in double overtime to No. 18 Xavier in the Charleston Classic tournament semifinals on November 22, 2019. The team ultimately went on to finish in 3rd place in the tournament after defeating Miami 80\u201355 the next day. Despite the loss, it became clear that UConn was becoming a more competitive team after suffering three losing seasons in a row. On January 18, 2020, after a 61\u201355 loss at No. 14 Villanova\u2014a non-conference game that would become a conference game the next year\u2014Hurley remarked that other teams \"better get us now. That's all, you better get us now. Because it's coming,\" foreshadowing the program's return to national relevance in the years ahead. In the penultimate game of the regular season, UConn defeated No. 21 Houston 77\u201371 at Gampel Pavilion on senior night and finished the year tied for fifth place in the American with a 10\u20138 record in conference play.\nUConn was set to face Tulane in the first round of the AAC tournament on March 12, 2020. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the AAC tournament being canceled mere hours before it was set to tip off. The team finished the season with a 19\u201312 overall record, its first winning season since 2015\u201316.\n\n2020\u201321 Season: Return to the Big East\nUConn's return to the Big East for the 2020\u201321 season was overshadowed by the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Huskies played all of their home games in Gampel Pavilion with no fans in attendance. Five games were cancelled, and four others were rescheduled as players, coaches and staff tested positive for the virus. The team gained several players this season that would play key roles in the years ahead, including future NCAA tournament MOP Adama Sanogo. Other recruits of note were future NBA draftees Andre Jackson Jr. and junior Tyrese Martin, who transferred from Rhode Island. UConn finished third in the conference and lost in the Big East tournament semifinals to #2 seed Creighton, 59\u201356.\nThe Huskies returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time in five years and were awarded a #7 seed. The season ended with a first-round loss to #10 seed Maryland, 64\u201353. UConn finished the season with a 15\u20138 overall record, playing its least number of games since the pre-Calhoun era.

During Bouknight's sophomore season at UConn, he was considered to be the team's top scorer, averaging 18.7 points and 5.7 rebounds per game throughout the season.\n\n2021\u201322 Season: Postseason Shortfalls\nDespite losing its leading scorer in Bouknight, UConn returned four out of five starters in the 2021\u201322 season and came into the year ranked No. 24 in the preseason AP Top 25 poll. The team also gained another 4-star recruiting class that included several key players in the following championship season, such as Jordan Hawkins, Samson Johnson, and redshirt Alex Karaban. The Huskies started off 5\u20130, including a 115\u2013109 double-overtime win against No. 19 Auburn in the Battle 4 Atlantis quarterfinals. The team lost to Michigan State in the semifinals the following day. On February 22, 2022, UConn defeated No. 8 Villanova 71\u201369 at the XL Center\u2014securing the program's first 20-win season in six years and its first top 10 win in eight years. \nUConn again finished third in the Big East, entering the postseason with a 22\u20138 record (13\u20136 in conference play), its highest regular-season win total since 2013\u201314. However, the Huskies lost in the Big East tournament semifinals for the second year in a row, this time narrowly to #2 seed Villanova, 63\u201360.\nUConn was awarded a #5 seed in the NCAA tournament, but the season ended with another first-round exit\u2014an upset loss to #12-seed New Mexico State, with a final score of 70\u201363. The team finished the season with a 23\u201310 overall record. Major contributions to the team's success came from shooting guard Tyrese Martin and point guard R. J. Cole, who averaged 15.8 points, 4.1 assists, and 3.4 rebounds per game throughout the season. Martin was a major rebounder for the team, averaging 7.5 rebounds and 13.6 points per game throughout the season. After the season, Martin was selected as the No. 51 overall pick in the 2022 NBA draft.\n\n2022\u201323 Season: 'Blue Blood', 5th NCAA Title\nThe Huskies entered the 2022\u201323 season unranked after losing eight scholarship players to transfer, graduation, and the draft. Despite this, UConn jumped out to a 14\u20130 start, winning the Phil Knight Invitational championship and climbing to No. 2 in the AP Top 25 poll by mid-December. The team cooled off in January, losing six of their next eight games, but returned to form and went 8\u20131 to close out the regular season. The Huskies finished fourth in the Big East and, for the third straight year, lost in the Big East tournament semifinals with a 70\u201368 loss to No. 1 seed Marquette.\nUConn was awarded a #4 seed in the NCAA tournament and then won six straight games by an average of 20.0 points to claim the program's fifth national championship, with a 76\u201359 victory over #5 seed San Diego State in the title game. Adama Sanogo was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, averaging over 20 points and 9.8 rebounds per game in the tournament. Shooting guard Jordan Hawkins was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament's West Regional after averaging 22 points and four rebounds in the Huskies' Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight games. He also scored 16 points against San Diego State in the 2023 national championship game. Other major contributions to the team's success came from shooting guard Andre Jackson Jr., as well as transfers Tristen Newton, Joey Calcaterra, and Hassan Diarra. Two freshmen, forward Alex Karaban and backup center Donovan Clingan, also made their mark on one of the most dominant teams in the history of March Madness.\nThe Huskies were the first team since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 to win every game by at least 13 points. Their smallest margin of victory was against Miami (FL) in the Final Four, 72\u201359. UConn finished the season with a 31\u20138 overall record. After the season, Hawkins and Jackson Jr. were selected in the 2023 NBA draft as the No. 14 and No. 36 overall picks, respectively. Sanogo signed as an undrafted free agent with the Chicago Bulls. Following the NCAA tournament, numerous analysts and commentators declared that UConn had earned \"blue blood\" status in college basketball\u2014placing the Huskies among the highest performing programs in the history of the sport.\n\n2023\u201324 Season: 'Back-to-Back', 6th NCAA Title\nDespite losing two of its top scorers in Hawkins and Sanogo to the NBA, UConn entered the 2023\u201324 season ranked No. 6 in the preseason AP Top 25 poll. The team gained a 5-star recruit in point guard Stephon Castle as well as future First-Team All-Big East transfer Cam Spencer.

The team lost its first non-conference game in 624 days at No. 5 Kansas on December 1, 2023, falling 69\u201365. The Huskies rebounded from the loss four days later with an 87\u201376 win over No. 9 North Carolina in the Jimmy V Classic. Coach Dan Hurley led UConn to a program-best 18 wins in Big East conference play, earning the Huskies their first Big East regular season title since 2006 and their 11th overall, a conference record.

The advent of the ECAC men's basketball tournaments in the 1974\u201375 season provided UConn with its first opportunity to win a postseason conference championship. Over the past half century, UConn has won 11 conference tournament titles. The program is currently tied with Georgetown for the most Big East tournament championships (8) all time.\nECAC New England Tournament (2)\n\n1976, 1979\nBig East Conference Tournament (8)\n\n1990, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2011, 2024\nAmerican Athletic Conference Tournament (1)\n\n2016\n\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nIndicates NCAA championship\n* Indicates overall number one seed\n\u2020 Indicates vacated by the NCAA\n\nNCAA Final Fours\n1999 \u2013 Champion\n2004 \u2013 Champion\n2009 \u2013 Semifinalist\n2011 \u2013 Champion\n2014 \u2013 Champion\n2023 \u2013 Champion\n2024 \u2013 Champion\n\nNational Championships\n1999 NCAA Title\nThe Huskies were the top seed in the West region, and a win over Gonzaga in the regional final sent UConn to Tropicana Field for the program's first Final Four appearance. They defeated Ohio State 64\u201358 in the National Semifinals to advance to play against Duke in the National Championship. Despite having been ranked No. 1 for half of the year, the Huskies entered the national championship game as 9-point underdogs.\nUConn won their first national title with a 77\u201374 victory. Richard Hamilton was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\n\n2004 NCAA Title\nIn 2004, the Huskies returned to the Final Four.

Two nights later, led by Emeka Okafor and Ben Gordon, Connecticut won their second national title with an 82\u201373 victory over Georgia Tech. Okafor was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nOne day later the UConn women's basketball team also won a national title, making UConn the first and only school in NCAA Division I history to have its men's and women's basketball programs win a national championship in the same season.\n\n2011 NCAA Title\nThe 2011 Huskies won 11 straight games in postseason play, the final six of which resulted in the program's third national championship. On April 4, 2011, they defeated the Butler Bulldogs, 53\u201341. UConn junior Kemba Walker was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nMany consider UConn's win in the Championship Game to be a great defensive performance, as the Huskies held Butler to only 18.8% shooting from the field (a record for field goal percentage defense in a championship game) and tied a title game record with ten blocked shots. An analysis by Sports Illustrated columnist Luke Winn credited the Huskies' defense by demonstrating, for instance, that they blocked or altered a staggering 26.6% of Butler's shots \u2013 compared to just 3.8% by Pittsburgh and 12.1% by VCU in earlier rounds. The 53 points scored by Connecticut were, in turn, the lowest point total by a winning team in a championship game since 1949.\n\n2014 NCAA Title\nIn 2014, led by American Athletic Conference Player of the Year Shabazz Napier, UConn became the first #7 seed to win the NCAA Championship, getting past No. 1 seed Florida, No. 2 seed Villanova, No. 3 seed Iowa State, and No. 4 seed Michigan State, before defeating the Kentucky Wildcats 60\u201354 in the championship game in Arlington, Texas. UConn is undefeated in the state of Texas in the Final Four (6\u20130).\nAs in 2004, the UConn women's basketball team also won a national title, making UConn the first and only school in NCAA Division I history to have its men's and women's basketball programs win a national championship in the same season twice.\n\n2023 NCAA Title\nIn 2023, the UConn Huskies won all of their tournament games by more than 10 points. Their path to the championship began against No. 13 seed Iona in the first round, in which they would trail at the half but eventually pull away in the end. The Huskies would then beat No. 5 Saint Mary's, No. 8 Arkansas, and No. 3 Gonzaga. The national semifinal would be a 13-point defeat of No. 5 Miami, their smallest margin of victory in the tournament.\nThe national championship would be a 17-point defeat of No. 5 San Diego State University as UConn won their fifth national title, moving the program into a tie for fourth-most NCAA championships all time.\n\n2024 NCAA Title\nIn 2024, the UConn Huskies became the first team to repeat as NCAA tournament champions since the Florida Gators in 2007. They won their sixth title, putting them at a tie with North Carolina for the third-most championships of all time. Once again, they won every tournament game by double digits; their smallest margin of victory in the entire tournament was 14 points against Alabama in the Final Four. The Huskies also set the record for the largest combined margin of victory in all their games with 140 points; and largest-average margin of victory of 23.3 points per game. Because of that, the 2024 Huskies are considered one of the most dominant teams in the history of March Madness, following up 2023's strong performance.\n\nComplete NCAA tournament results\nThe Huskies have appeared in the NCAA tournament 37 times. Their combined record is 70\u201332. They have been to seven Final Fours and are six-time National Champions (1999, 2004, 2011, 2014, 2023, 2024).\n\n*NCAA vacated all of UConn's games in 1996 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

They were NIT champions in 1988.\n\nCoaches\nThe following is a list of Connecticut Huskies men's basketball head coaches. The team is currently coached by Dan Hurley, alongside associate head coach Kimani Young and assistant coaches Luke Murray and Mike Nardi.\n\nNote: Records updated through end of 2024\u201325 season.\n\nRetired numbers\nTwo men's basketball players have had their numbers retired at UConn. For more than a century, UConn's basketball programs did not have any retired numbers.

Hamilton's number retirement ceremony was held at Gampel Pavilion on February 24, 2024.\n\nHuskies of Honor\nThe Huskies of Honor program recognizes the top players, coaches and administrators in the history of UConn men's and women's basketball. On December 26, 2006, the university announced the inaugural class, which included 13 players and 3 coaches from the men's basketball program. The men's basketball inaugural class was formally inducted in a ceremony on February 5, 2007. Former athletic director John Toner was inducted on February 28, 2009. On April 5, 2011, Kemba Walker was the first men's basketball player to be added to the program since the inaugural inductees, an honor he was bestowed after leading the team to a national championship.\nThe Huskies of Honor are each recognized by a four by five foot panel which displays his name, jersey number and years of service, and a plaque which summarizes each's career accomplishments; Both the panels and the plaques are on permanent display at Gampel Pavilion on the main campus of the University of Connecticut in Storrs.\n\nPlayers\nCoaches and administrators\nHugh Greer, head coach, 1946\u20131963\nDee Rowe, head coach, 1969\u20131977\nJohn Toner, athletic director, 1969\u20131987\nJim Calhoun, head coach, 1986\u20132012\n\nTeams\n1999 National Championship Team\n2004 National Championship Team\n\nHuskies in the NBA\nSince the creation of the National Basketball Association in 1946, more than 40 former UConn stars have played in the league. Thirteen of them have received NBA honors and awards, and five have won an NBA championship. While the league has shown an interest in UConn's top players since the first NBA draft in 1947, the Huskies emerged as a consistent talent pipeline to the professional level in the 1990s.\nUConn has produced some of the greatest players in NBA history, nearly all in the past three decades. The list of former UConn players in the NBA includes:\n\nRay Allen, a 10-time NBA All-Star who won two NBA championships and retired as the NBA's all-time leader in 3-point field goals made. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018. In 2021, Allen was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team, which honored the 75 greatest players in NBA history.

Bialosuknia was selected by the Oakland Oaks in the first round of the inaugural ABA draft in 1967. While he only played one season in the ABA, he finished with the league's second-highest 3-point field goal percentage and the league record for most consecutive 3-point field goals (9). Foster was selected by the Carolina Cougars in the seventh round of the ABA draft in 1974. He spent two seasons in the ABA and played in the ABA All-Star game as a member of the Denver Nuggets in 1976. After the 1975\u201376 season concluded, the ABA merged with the NBA. Foster then faced a contract dispute with Nuggets and left the team. He briefly played in Europe before retiring from professional basketball.\n\nHuskies in USA Basketball\nSince 1980, USA Basketball has selected 23 players and three coaches with UConn ties to represent the United States in international competition.

    "summary": "The UConn Huskies men's basketball program is the NCAA Division I men's college basketball team of the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. They currently play in the Big East Conference and are coached by Dan Hurley. With six national championships and 45 conference titles, the program is considered one of the blue bloods of college basketball.\nUConn has won six NCAA tournament championships (1999, 2004, 2011, 2014, 2023 and 2024), which puts the program in a tie for third most all time and is the most of any program since the tournament expanded to 64 teams. The Huskies have won eight Big East tournament championships (tied for most all time) and 11 Big East regular season championships (most all time). UConn has 37 NCAA tournament appearances (tied for 11th most all time) and has played in seven NCAA Final Fours (tied for 10th most all time), 13 NCAA Elite Eights (11th most all time) and 19 NCAA Sweet Sixteens (tied for 11th most all time). UConn won the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship in 1988 and the NIT third-place game in 1997, with 13 NIT appearances in total. The Huskies also have one American Athletic Conference tournament championship and two ECAC New England regional tournament championships.\nFrom the Huskies' first game in 1900\u201301 season to the end of the 2024\u201325 season, the program has amassed 1,861 wins and compiled a .645 winning percentage, both top 25 in NCAA Division I history. Initially a New England regional powerhouse, UConn won multiple conference championships in the 1920s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including a run of 10-straight Yankee Conference championships from 1951 to 1960. The Huskies appeared in the NCAA tournament 11 times between 1939 and 1970\u2014second most of any school in the tournament's early era\u2014reaching their first Sweet Sixteen in 1956 and first Elite Eight in 1964. The program began its emergence as a national powerhouse after becoming a charter member of the newly formed Big East Conference in 1979, building steadily from its first national postseason championship in the NIT in 1988 to its first NCAA championship in 1999.\nSince 1999, the Huskies have won six national championships in a span of 25 years, one of the best runs in the sport's history. In 2024, UConn became the eighth school in NCAA Division I history to win back-to-back national championships, and the first to do so in 17 years. After the 2023\u201324 season, Fox Sports dubbed the Huskies' sustained success \"the greatest run of the 21st century\" and recognized UConn as \"one of the greatest programs in the history of college basketball.\"",

  "UNC Greensboro Spartans": {
    "biography": "The UNC Greensboro (UNCG) Spartans men's basketball team represents the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in NCAA Division I. The school's team currently competes in the Southern Conference.\n\nHistory\nThe school, formerly The Women's College of The University of North Carolina, allowed male students beginning 1965-66 and started a men's basketball program the following year. The first coach was an instructor in the Physical Education program, the assistant was an administrator in the Chancellor's office, with some limited experience from the University of Kansas basketball program. Games were scheduled with Belmont Abbey, Elon, Guilford, and a few other small colleges. Players came from already-enrolled students, responding to on-campus ads. No records of results are available. UNCG formalized their program and entered into a twenty-year period participating  as an NCAA Division III member, before moving up to NCAA Division II in 1988, and swiftly ascending to NCAA Division I by 1991.\n\n1991-1999: Division I Firsts for the Spartans\nMike Dement served as the architect of the program in its move to Division I. Dement was the Spartans' head coach from 1991 to 1995, leading them from a team with no conference affiliation to the top of the Big South Conference regular season standings in just four seasons. In his last two seasons at UNCG, Dement's teams went 38\u201318, including a then school-record 23 wins in 1994\u201395, along with the Big South Conference's regular season title. That team received votes in the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today Coaches' polls, a first for the program.\nFollowing the 1994-95 season, Dement left to take over the men's basketball program at Southern Methodist University (SMU) and was replaced in Greensboro by Randy Peele. In only the second season in which UNCG was eligible for Division I postseason competition, the Spartans won the Big South Conference regular season and tournament championship, advancing to the NCAA tournament where they received the 15th seed in the Southeast region. In their first NCAA appearance, they fell in the first round to the Cincinnati Bearcats.\nAfter following up their conference championship season with a 10\u201320 regular season, UNCG left the Big South in 1997 to join the Southern Conference (SoCon).  The Spartans finished near the bottom of their division in both of their first two seasons in the SoCon and, after four years in Greensboro, Peele left the Spartans and took an assistant job at Virginia Tech.\n\n1999-2005: Fran McCaffery Brings the Spartans Back\nFran McCaffery hit the ground running in Greensboro, compiling a 15\u201313 record overall and a 9\u20137 Southern Conference mark in his first season that was the 18th-most improved record nationally among NCAA Division I teams.\nIn his second season, McCaffery guided the Spartans to a 19\u201312 record and the 2001 SoCon tournament championship. It was the school's second NCAA tournament berth. The Spartans received a 16 seed, losing in the first round to overall tournament top seed Stanford.\nThe following year (2001\u20132002) McCaffery led the Spartans to their first 20-win season since joining the SoCon. It marked the first time the program claimed a share of the SoCon North Division title as well. After falling to eventual tournament champion Davidson in the conference tournament semifinals, the Spartans were awarded a berth into the 2002 NIT, where they lost to eventual champion Memphis.\nIn his final year in Greensboro, McCaffery brought the Spartans to the brink of the NCAA Tournament before a SoCon Championship game loss to Chattanooga. He led UNCG to a victory over the Davidson Wildcats in the semifinals, defeating a team that had been 16\u20130 in conference play. A big part of that success was SoCon Freshman of the Year Kyle Hines. Hines set UNCG and SoCon records for blocked shots, and also broke several other UNCG single-game and freshman single-season marks. After the season, McCaffery left UNCG to take the head men's basketball position at Siena College.\n\n2005-2011: Return of Mike Dement\nIn his first season back at UNCG, Mike Dement led a young Spartan squad to a 12\u201319 mark. He had two players earn all-conference status in Ricky Hickman and Kyle Hines, and another earn SoCon All-Freshman honors.\nIn 2006\u201307, Dement guided the Spartans to a 16\u201314 mark, including a second-place finish in the Southern Conference's Northern Division. Hines, only a junior, earned Southern Conference Player of the Year and Associated Press All-America Honorable Mention status \u2013 both accomplishments were firsts for the UNCG program. The Spartans were considered by many to be the most dangerous team in that year's SoCon Tournament, but were upended in the final seconds by Furman in the quarterfinal round.\nDespite milestones like the program's first-ever win over an Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC team) (Georgia Tech in 2007), and the largest ever home crowd at a UNCG basketball game (21,124 vs Duke in 2005), Dement's teams saw little success in his return. After several seasons with fewer than 10 victories, Dement eventually resigned in the middle of the 2011-12 season.\n\nMove to Greensboro Coliseum\nBeginning with the 2009\u201310 season, the men's basketball team plays all of their home games in the Greensboro Coliseum. The arena, which holds over 23,000 seats, is configured to hold around 7,500 spectators for most games.\nAs part of the move, the Coliseum remodeled a floor to become a Spartan home floor and also completely renovated a massive locker room space for the team, complete with training room, meeting facilities, coaches offices and a players' lounge.\n\n2011-2021: Sustained Success Under Wes Miller\nFollowing the mid-season resignation of Mike Dement in December 2011, Wes Miller was given the reins of the program on an interim basis. At the time, the Spartans had a record of 2-8 and were in the midst of an eleven-game losing streak. Under Miller, the team finished Southern Conference play with a 10-8 record, 13-19 overall, winning first place in the Southern Conference North Division. Miller was named the 2012 Southern Conference Coach of the Year and was hired officially as head coach.\nThe Spartans struggled in Miller's first few years, but he soon brought UNCG an unprecedented run of success. The Spartans reached 25 wins for three successive seasons between 2016 and 2019, won three Southern Conference championships, reached the NCAA tournament in 2018 and 2021, and recorded the program's first postseason victory in the 2019 NIT. Miller is currently the winningest coach in the program's history.\nPlayers recruited by Wes Miller regularly set new Spartan records. Guard Francis Alonso became UNCG's all-time leader in made 3-pointers  and was a two-time first-team All-SoCon selection (2018, 2019). The Spartans also boasted four consecutive Southern Conference Defensive Players of the Year in forward  James L. Dickey III (2018) and guard Isaiah Miller (2019, 2020, 2021). Isaiah Miller would go on to become the most decorated player in program history, being named SoCon Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 2020 and 2021, the first player to earn back to back SoCon Player of the Year awards since Stephen Curry at Davidson University.\nThe 2018\u20132019 Spartans enjoyed what was arguably their most successful season under Wes Miller. The team went 29\u20137, finishing 2nd in the Southern Conference and receiving the #1 overall seed in the NIT tournament where they beat Campbell University in the first round before losing to eventual tournament runners-up Libscomb University.\nOn April 14, 2021, Miller left UNCG to become the head men's basketball coach at the University of Cincinnati.\n\n2021-Present: Mike Jones Era\nOn April 19, 2021, UNCG hired Mike Jones as head men's basketball coach.\n\nRetired Numbers\nIsaiah Miller #1\nMiller is first all-time in steals at UNCG with 315, second in field goals with 831, and third in career points with 1,967 career. He led the SoCon in steals for three consecutive seasons from 2018-21, and sits second all-time in the history of the conference. Miller finished his collegiate career at UNCG ranked fourth in scoring average at 14.9 points per game. After leading the Spartans to a SoCon Regular Season and Tournament title in 2021, he become the only UNCG men's basketball player to appear in multiple NCAA Tournaments. \nHe was later named the Bob Waters SoCon Male Athlete of the Year, the first Spartan to ever win the award. He was also named SoCon Coaches' and Media Player of the Year two times (2019-20 and 2020-21) - only the second player in conference history to do so - and SoCon Defensive Player of the Year in each of his final three seasons.\n\nScott Hartzell #5\nHartzell was inducted into the UNCG Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006. He led UNCG in three-point field goals, three-point shooting percentage, and free throw shooting percentage all four seasons he played. He graduated in 1996 as the school's all-time leader in points at 1,539 and assists at 552. Though those marks have since been eclipsed, he still holds the UNCG record for career three-point field goal percentage (43.9%).\nIn 1995\u201396, Hartzell led the Spartans to their first NCAA men's basketball tournament appearance after winning the 1996 Big South Championship. During that memorable run, Hartzell ran his streak of consecutive games with a three-point field goal to 42 straight.\n\nFrancis Alonso #10\nA member of the Spartans from 2015-19, Alonso leads UNCG with 396 three-pointers made in his collegiate career, 426 made free throws and an 87.1 free-throw percentage. His total for three-point baskets ranks third in SoCon history while his mark for free throws converted stands at seventh all-time in the conference's history.\nAlonso is the second player in UNCG history to reach the 2,000-point plateau, with a career total of 2,142 points. He helped UNCG win its first-ever postseason game vs. Houston Baptist in the Greensboro Coliseum in 2016, and finished his college career as a two-time National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) All-District first team honoree as well as being voted first team All-SoCon Coaches and Media in 2017-18 and 2018-19.\n\nCourtney Eldridge #23\nEldridge led the Spartans to the 2001 Southern Conference tournament championship against University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and their second NCAA tournament appearance. \nDuring the 2001\u20132002 season, he was ranked 9th in the Nation and 1st in the SoCon in steals, 23rd in the nation and 3rd in the conference in assists., leading that team to the 2002 Southern Conference regular season title and earning a bid to the NIT.\nEldridge is the Spartan's all-time career leader in assists (584).\n\nKyle Hines #42\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Kyle Hines became the first player in UNCG history to receive the Southern Conference Player of the Year honor and to be named to the Associated Press All-America Honorable Mention. He became only the sixth player to score 2,000 points, grab 1,000 rebounds and block 300 shots in his college career, joining the ranks of David Robinson, Alonzo Mourning, Tim Duncan, Pervis Ellison and Derrick Coleman.\nHines is the Spartan's all-time leader in a number of statistical categories, including points (2187), blocks (349), points per game (18.2), and rebounds per game (8.7).\n\nSeason-by-season results\nPostseason\nNCAA Division I Tournament results\nThe Spartans have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament four times.

He succeeded Andy Enfield, who coached the team from 2013\u20132024.\n\nHistory\nThe USC Trojans have an all-time record of 1,500\u20131,097 (.578) in intercollegiate basketball games. They boast 25 All-Americans, 14 league\nchampionships, one conference tournament title, 16 NCAA tournament appearances, five Sweet Sixteen appearances, four Elite Eight appearances, and two Final Four appearances. Sam Barry and four of his USC players (Jack Gardner, Alex Hannum, Tex Winter and Bill Sharman) have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches. (Sharman was also inducted as a player.)\n\nThe early years (1906\u201328)\nOn December 7, 1906 the Los Angeles Herald reported: \"Basketball Is Started At U.S.C.\" The first official game of USC basketball was an interclass drubbing by the freshman over the sophomores, 25\u20132. USC would later host its debut intercollegiate basketball game, the first of its kind in Southern California, on January 16, 1907 with an 18\u201315 win over Occidental College.\nAfter a standout season in 1910, when USC placed second in the league, the Methodists (as they had been known at the time) slowly grew the program under the direction of a series of player-managers and part-time coaches. Several football headmen served as basketball coaches during that time, including Ralph Glaze, Dean Cromwell, Elmer \"Gloomy Gus\" Henderson, and Leo Calland. In addition, USC's basketball team was often littered with football standouts such as USC Athletic Hall of Famers Morley Drury and Jess Mortensen.\nIn 1922 USC joined the Pacific Coast Conference. The Trojans then won their first conference title in 1928 under Calland's leadership, edging past the Washington Huskies in the second and final game of the conference championship series. With a see-sawing score for most of the game, Charley Bone buried two shots in the last minute to secure the 27\u201326 victory and begin a new era of achievement for USC basketball.\n\nThe Sam Barry era (1929\u201350)\nWhen football assistant and basketball head coach Leo Calland left USC in the summer of 1929 to become the football head coach and athletic director of the University of Idaho, legendary USC football coach Howard Jones found himself in need of a new assistant and the university in need of a new basketball head coach. Jones recommended Sam Barry, one of his former assistants at the University of Iowa who had also coached Hawkeye basketball for seven years. Barry agreed to follow Jones west, once more joining his football staff while also taking control of the basketball program.\n\nBuilding a national power (1929\u201341)\nBarry brought with him an aggressive style of play uncommon outside the Midwest. His strategic innovations would lay the groundwork for the Triangle offense and his campaign to do away with the center jump after each basket would change the game forever. \"It is rumored that other conference coaches are eyeing the Trojans with no little anxiety,\" the Daily Trojan mused in the lead up to Barry's first season. The Trojans finished the 1929\u201330 season with an overall record of 15\u20135. USC defeated the Washington Huskies in three games to win the PCC championship for the second time in school history. Guard Johnny Lehners and center Jess Mortensen received All-America honors at the end of the season, becoming the first two All-Americans in program history.\nProducing three more All-Americans (Jerry Nemer, Lee Guttero [2-time], Eddie Oram), USC dominated the PCC South Division for much of the 1930s, with five straight division titles from 1932 to 1936 and a title in 1939. In 1935 the Trojans also won the conference title with a victory over Oregon State in Corvallis. After falling to the Beavers in the first game of the series, USC won the second to tie the series. USC won the third contest by a score of 32\u201331, with All-Southern Division forward Ernie Holbrook making the game-winning shot in the final seconds of the game.\nUSC won its ninth division title in 12 years in the 1939\u201340 season after defeating Oregon State in two games at the Shrine Auditorium. Led by All-American Ralph Vaughn, USC received its first invitation to the eight-team NCAA tournament and was considered a favorite to challenge for the national title. The Trojans defeated Colorado, 38\u201332, in the first round to face Phog Allen's Kansas in the semi-finals. Senior Keith Lambert gave the Trojans the lead with less than a minute remaining in the game, but Howard Engleman scored with 16 seconds remaining to give Kansas the 43\u201342 win.\n\nWorld War II and the coaching carousel (1942\u201345)\nIn January 1942, Barry, then-head coach of the three major sports at USC, enlisted in the Navy as a lieutenant commander and was appointed athletic director for the Navy's western V-5 physical training school in St. Marys, Georgia. Assistant coach Julie Bescos assumed head-coaching responsibilities in Barry's absence, finishing the season until he too left for service in the Navy later in 1942. Jack Hupp, two-time All-Southern Division forward for USC in 1935 and 1936, was then named head coach in October, but in November he joined the Air Force. Ernie Holbrook, Hupp's former teammate and star of the 1935 PCC champion team, then became head coach after the first game of the season and led the Trojans to a 23\u20135 record and their tenth PCC South Division title in the 1943\u201344 season. Gene Rock and Ted Gossard were named All-Americans. The following year, however, Holbrook was called to service in the Army, becoming the fourth USC basketball coach to leave for military service in two years.\nBobby Muth, a former teammate of both Hupp and Holbrook, was chosen to be the newest replacement head coach. Muth struggled to match the performance of his predecessor, with no returning players from 1943's division-winning team due to the war. In his first year as head coach, he managed a disappointing 8\u201312 record, USC's first losing record in 11 years.\nJulie Bescos returned to USC after the war's end in 1945 as an assistant football coach, having earned a Silver Star for overseeing the rescue and evacuation of wounded sailors as a flight deck officer on the kamikaze-damaged USS Saratoga. He was posthumously inducted into the USC Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007.\nFormer player and coach Ernie Holbrook died during combat in Europe. As a private in the 28th \"Keystone\" Infantry Division, Holbrook was killed during the early stages of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. Each year, the Ernie Holbrook Memorial Award is given in his memory to the team's most inspirational basketball player.\n\nSam Barry returns (1945\u201350)\nWith the surrender of the Japanese in August 1945, Sam Barry was discharged from the Navy, receiving a Naval Commendation for his work in the physical and military training of Navy personnel in the South Pacific. He then returned to his pre-war post as head basketball coach. Barry never managed to truly to regain his pre-war success, however. Before the war, Barry compiled a win\u2013loss record of 208\u201395, winning 68% of his games. In games after the war, his winning percentage fell to 58%, with an overall record of 68\u201349. Despite this decline in performance, Barry's teams still finished second in the division in all but one season during the final five years of his career.\nBarry's 1949\u201350 USC team produced another All-American in Bill Sharman. On September 23, 1950, while scouting for football at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, Barry suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 57. He remains USC's all-time winningest coach, with an overall record of 260\u2013138. In his 17 years as head coach, his teams won eight division titles and three conference titles, and featured eight All-Americans. His 40 consecutive wins over crosstown rival UCLA stand as the longest winning streak by any coach against a single opponent in the history of college basketball.\n\nThe Forrest Twogood era (1951\u201366)\nIn the wake of Sam Barry's sudden death in September 1950, USC turned to assistant coach Forrest Twogood, who had previously been the head coach at the University of Idaho and the University of San Francisco.  Mr Twogood had worked as an assistant to Barry, coaching the Trojan freshmen, and had played for Barry at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe Final Four (1954)\nTwo weeks before the 1953\u201354 season's end and in third place in the PCC, USC won two games against then-second-place California. The Trojans' next and final conference series of the regular season came against the first-place UCLA Bruins. Coming into the series, John Wooden's Bruins\u2014winners of four division titles in five years\u2014were on a 13-game win streak, had not been defeated at home all season, had not lost both games of a series at home in six years, and needed just one win in two games to secure the division title.\nUSC's third team All-America center, Roy Irvin, scored 29 points in the first game in leading the Trojans past the Bruins, 79\u201368. In the second contest, another strong performance from Irvin saw the Trojans with the lead late in the game, until UCLA tied the score in the final minute. Trojan substitute Chet Carr made a 10-foot jump-shot in the waning seconds, securing the win and the Trojans' first outright division championship in 11 years.\n\nUSC faced the Oregon State Beavers and their 7-foot, 3-inch center, Wade Halbrook in the PCC Championship series to determine which team would represent the PCC in the NCAA Tournament. In the opening game of the series, the Trojans contained Halbrook and came away with a 65\u201347 victory. In the second game, Halbrook scored 12 points and stifled the USC offense with his rebounding and defense. The Beavers outscored the Trojans 20\u20136 in the final ten minutes of the first half, and despite a third-quarter comeback attempt, USC was defeated for the first time in six games.\nThe final game was a close affair throughout. Halbrook and Irvin led their teams' efforts in the final minutes, trading baskets and the lead until Irvin's hook shot gave the Trojans the lead for good with under a minute remaining. Two free throws from captain Dick Welsh with 27 seconds remaining secured the 48\u201345 win for USC.\nUSC advanced to the 16-team NCAA Tournament and began tournament play in Corvallis, where the Trojans defeated Idaho State in the first round, 73\u201359. In the second-round game, the Trojans faced the Santa Clara Broncos, a team that had played in three consecutive NCAA Tournaments. The game was closely contested throughout, with 13 lead changes and eight ties. The third quarter saw a forward surge from the Trojans, which the Broncos matched as the quarter closed. Santa Clara entered the final 40 seconds of a low-scoring fourth quarter with a three-point lead. USC's Irvin was fouled as he scored on a lay-in, and his made free throw tied the game at 57\u201357. The score remained tied at the end of the regulation period. In the final minute of the overtime period, the Trojans again trailed by three points. Welsh scored to bring the Trojans within one point of Santa Clara. Guard Tony Psaltis then tied the score at 65\u201365 with a free throw, forcing a second overtime period.\nA single point\u2014coming on a free throw from USC's Welsh during the first 30 seconds of the second five-minute overtime period\u2014provided the winning margin for the Trojans. In the same year the NBA introduced the 24-second shot clock, Santa Clara held the ball to stall the game for four minutes and seven seconds. With 17 seconds remaining, the Broncos' Ken Sears attempted to drive to the basket. Several Trojans surrounded him and forced a turnover. Time expired and the Trojans advanced to the Final Four in Kansas City.\nUSC faced the Bradley Braves in the Final Four game. The Trojans maintained a lead for most of the contest, but Bradley mounted a comeback in the fourth quarter. Holding a one-point lead with one minute remaining, the Trojans were without leading scorer Roy Irvin, who had fouled out of the game. Bradley scored five unanswered points in the final minute to take a 74\u201370 lead, securing the win. USC's Jack Dunne scored with six seconds remaining, but the score was not sufficient to erase the Trojans' deficit. USC fell to Penn State in the national third-place game, 70\u201361, after the Trojans' late comeback attempt, begun as they trailed by 20 points, fell short.\nThe USC student-run newspaper, the Daily Trojan, reflected on the season:\n\nThe fact remains that what they already have done is simply phenomenal. They have defied all the \"impossible,\" \"can't do,\" \"never,\" and \"too much\" odds to rise to this station today. On their way they won the PCC Southern Division, Pacific Coast Conference and NCAA Western Regional titles. This should seem \"enough\" for a team that was once pronounced \"dead.\"\n- Jack McCurdy, March 19, 1954\n\nThe Bob Boyd era (1967\u201379)\nIn a 13-year career as head coach of the USC basketball team his teams went 216\u2013131 overall and played in the post-season four times (the 1979 NCAA playoffs, 1973 NIT and 1974 and 1975 Commissioner's Conference tourney). His 1971 team, which went 24\u20132 and was ranked fifth in the nation (USC was ranked first at midseason), is regarded among USC's best (he also won 24 games in 1974). His wins over UCLA in 1969 and 1970 were the UCLA's first losses in Pauley Pavilion, built in 1966. He was twice named the conference Coach of the Year. He sent ten players into the NBA, including Paul Westphal and Gus Williams.\n\nMorrison and Raveling (1980\u201394)\nIn seven seasons at USC, Stan Morrison had a record of 103\u201395 and finished first in the Pac-10 in 1985. George Raveling took over the program in 1987, leading the Trojans to two NCAA tournament appearances. He compiled a 115\u2013118 overall record in eight seasons.\n\nThe Henry Bibby era (1995\u20132005)\nIn 1995, Former UCLA great Henry Bibby was named head coach of USC men's basketball. In ten seasons, Bibby had an overall won-loss record of 131\u2013111 at USC. He led his 1997, 2001 and 2002 teams to the NCAA tournament, including an \"Elite Eight\" appearance in 2001, but was fired after four games into his final season.\n\nRecent success\nUSC advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the 2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, led by future NBA players Nick Young, Taj Gibson, and Gabe Pruitt, with Tim Floyd as their head coach.  This was the first time since 2001, and the second time since 1961.  This team defeated Kevin Durant and the Texas Longhorns before facing Tyler Hansbrough and the UNC Tar Heels in the Sweet Sixteen. USC had built a sizable lead in the first half against UNC before multiple questionable foul calls against Taj Gibson forced USC to sit Taj Gibson for an extended period of time in the second half, whereby the Tar Heels were able to take the lead and win the game.\n\n2007\u201308\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, USC featured guard O. J. Mayo from Huntington High School. He had been ranked by several major sports publications as the top prospect of the 2007 recruiting class.  During the 2007\u20132008 season, the Trojans played the Kansas Jayhawks and the Oklahoma Sooners at home.  They also played in the Anaheim Classic from November 22\u201325, 2007.  Each night, USC played a team from the Big Ten, Big East, SEC, and Big 12.  Additionally, they had a return game against the South Carolina Gamecocks in Columbia, South Carolina. After the regular season and Pac-10 Tournament had ended, USC earned a #6 seed in the NCAA Tournament. The Trojans were seeded against the #11 seed Kansas State Wildcats. This first-round game gained heavy media attention because of the matchup between college phenoms O. J. Mayo and Michael Beasley. Although the game was relatively close throughout the first half and early second half, the Wildcats came away with the victory by a score of 80\u201367. As expected by many, Mayo entered the NBA draft at the end of the 2007\u201308 season. He was selected as the 3rd overall lottery pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Trojans finished the 2007\u201308 season with a record of 21\u201312. However, on January 3, 2010, the University concluded its internal investigation over allegations that Mayo received improper benefits during his stay at USC in 2007\u201308. The University concluded that Mayo did receive improper benefits and that head coach Tim Floyd was an active participant in ensuring that Mayo continued to receive money and gifts on behalf of a sports agent, in violation of NCAA rules. Therefore, USC declared Mayo ineligible to play in 2007\u201308, and USC Basketball has voluntarily vacated all regular season wins from the 2007\u201308 season. The USC record for 2007\u201308 thus is 0\u201312, a result of the peculiar scoring rules for marking vacated wins as no contests.\n\n2008\u201309\nThe 2008\u201309 Trojans team featured the 3rd-ranked recruit in the nation according to Rivals.com, All-American forward DeMar DeRozan. USC also received a commitment from point guard Percy Romeo Miller, Jr aka Lil Romeo, the son of Master P. The team opted not to have an October 17, 2008 Midnight Madness celebration.\nBuilding upon the success of previous years, the Trojans defeated Arizona State in the Pac-10 Championship Game and clinched their third straight NCAA Tournament appearance.  They defeated Boston College to reach the second round, where they lost 74\u201369 to eventual runner-up Michigan State.\n\nThe Kevin O'Neill era (2009\u20132013)\nKevin James O'Neill was named head coach of the USC men's basketball team on June 20, 2009, inheriting a program under serious NCAA sanctions linked to former player O.J. Mayo. Despite significant obstacles including postseason bans and the loss of key recruits, O'Neill brought extensive experience from coaching at college and NBA levels to rebuild the team.\nIn his inaugural 2009-10 season, O'Neill led the Trojans to a 16-14 record, tying for fifth in the Pac-10 and earning the 2010 Pac-10 Coach of the Year award from CollegeInsiders.com. The team recorded an eight-game winning streak and won the inaugural Diamond Head Classic in Hawaii, defeating several NCAA tournament teams including No. 9 Tennessee and UNLV.\nThe 2010-11 season marked the peak of O'Neill's tenure as USC finished 19-15, secured an NCAA Tournament berth, and tied for fourth in the Pac-10. The Trojans were eliminated in the first round by eventual Final Four team VCU. Key to the team's success was the emergence of Nikola Vucevic, who transformed under O'Neill's coaching to become a first team all-conference player and future NBA draft pick. USC also ranked high defensively in the Pac-10, holding opponents to a .409 shooting percentage and a conference low in scoring.\nHowever, injuries devastated the 2011-12 roster, with senior point guard Jio Fontan, and starting forwards Dewayne Dedmon and Aaron Fuller sidelined, leaving USC with just six scholarship players and a struggling 6-26 season. Recruiting challenges and inconsistency continued into 2012-13, and O'Neill was relieved of his duties in January 2013 after a 7-10 start, ending a four-year rebuilding effort.\nTop Contributors: \n2009\u201310 Season: \nDwight Lewis (G): Senior guard: 13.8 PPG, 3.3 RPG, 2.2 APG (led team in scoring)\nNikola Vucevic (F): Sophomore forward: 10.7 PPG, 9.4 RPG, 1.3 BPG, .504 FG% (led Pac-10 in rebounding, double-doubles leader, Pac-10 Most Improved)\nAlex Stepheson (F): Junior transfer, strong rebounder and shot-blocker, complementing Vucevic.\nDonte Smith (G): Contributed perimeter scoring and leadership as a junior guard.\n2010\u201311 Season: Key Performers\nNikola Vucevic (F): Junior, 17.1 PPG, 10.3 RPG, 1.4 BPG, .500 FG% (All-Pac-10 First Team, team leader in points and rebounds)\nJio Fontan (G): Sophomore transfer, 10.5 PPG, 3.9 APG \nAlex Stepheson (F): Senior, double-double threat, provided physicality and rebounding.\nMaurice Jones (G): Freshman, big defensive stats, exceptional in steals and assists.\nMarcus Simmons (G): Named 2011 Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year and selected to the Pac-10 All-Defensive Team.\nBryce Dejean-Jones played for USC during the 2010\u201311 season before transferring to UNLV and later Iowa State.

His record was approximately 48-70 overall, with the high point of an NCAA tournament appearance in 2010-11. He was replaced midseason in 2013 by associate head coach Bob Cantu.\nThis era was marked by resilience, commendable coaching achievements, but ultimate struggles to return USC to sustained basketball prominence\n\nSanctions\nOn January 3, 2010, USC announced that it had implemented self-imposed sanctions for violations of NCAA rules related to Mayo.  The sanctions include a one-year ban on postseason competition following the 2009\u20132010 regular season, a reduction of one scholarship for the 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011 academic years, and reductions in the numbers of recruiting days and coaches participating in off-campus recruiting through 2011.  The school also vacated all wins earned during the 2007\u20132008 season, due to Mayo's ineligibility at that time. Prior to the announcement USC was on a winning streak, improving their record to 10\u20134 overall and 2\u20130 in the Pac-10 conference, including a win on December 31, 2009, against Arizona and on January 2, 2010, against Arizona State. Their schedule that season featured challenging games against top-ranked teams like Texas, Saint Mary's and Tennessee and included the Diamond Head Classic Championship.\n\nAndy Enfield and return to prominence (2013\u2013present)\nAfter becoming the first head coach to lead a 15-seed to the Sweet 16, guiding his Florida Gulf Coast Eagles to upsets of Georgetown and San Diego State, Andy Enfield was hired as the new head coach at USC on April 1, 2013. Enfield replaces interim coach Bob Cantu, who substituted for fired coach Kevin O'Neill, terminated after a 7\u201310 start to the Trojans' season. The Trojans had finished the season 14\u201318 and had missed the NCAA Tournament the previous two years.\nEnfield's first two assistant hires were Tony Bland from SDSU with a reported contract of $300,000 per year, and Jason Hart from Pepperdine University.  Both have strong reputations as recruiters.\nOn September 26, 2017, federal prosecutors announced bribery, soliciting a bribe and wire fraud charges against assistant coach Tony Bland.\nOn April 4, 2024, Enfield was replaced by Eric Musselman, who departed from being the head basketball coach for the University of Arkansas.\n\nFacilities\nThe stage of Shrine Auditorium served as home court for USC basketball for much of the 1940s. However, the nature of hosting a basketball game in a theater meant that visibility was limited except in the center section of the audience. \"If you had a seat on the extreme right or left, you missed seeing one basket,\" said Alex Omalev, a Trojan forward from 1940 to 1943. The score was kept by two men seated on an elevated platform and a gun blast marked the end of each half. \nBeginning in 1949  the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in the Fairfax District hosted USC basketball until 1959 at which point the Trojans moved into the nearby Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, where they would remain for close to the next 50 years.\nUSC had talked about building an on-campus arena for the better part of a century and that dream finally came to fruition when Louis Galen, successful banker and long-time Trojan fan, donated a total $50 million to ensure the facility was built. They broke ground in 2004 and the Galen Center officially opened its doors in 2006, becoming the new home of USC basketball.\nThe facility is 255,000 square feet (23,700 m2), with a 45,000 square foot (4,200 m2) pavilion, and has three practice courts and offices. The seating capacity is 10,258, and there are 22 private suites. Total construction cost was an estimated $147 million.\nThe first men's basketball game was held on November 16, 2006 against the University of South Carolina. The first sellout crowd was the men's basketball game against the UCLA Bruins on January 12, 2007 with an attendance of 9,682. On January 31, 2008 the USC men's basketball game against the Arizona Wildcats set the arena's attendance record with a crowd of 10,258 in attendance. That record has been matched four times since: February 17, 2008 vs UCLA; January 11, 2009 vs UCLA; January 9, 2011 vs UCLA, and February 13, 2022 vs. UCLA (which also saw the largest student section to date).\n\nCoaches\nThe following are the USC men's head basketball coaches who have led the Trojans against conference competition. Prior to fielding conference teams, USC men's basketball was also coached by notable USC coaches such as Dean Cromwell who was a track and field and baseball coach as well as Elmer \"Gloomy Gus\" Henderson who also coached baseball and football at USC.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Trojans have appeared in twenty NCAA Tournaments (with one appearance vacated), including two Final Four appearances. USC's combined record is 17\u201321* (17\u201320).\n\n* 2008 tournament appearance and loss to Kansas State were vacated due to NCAA penalty. The revised record is 12\u201317 all-time.\n\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nNIT results\nThe Trojans have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) five times. Their combined record is 3\u20135.\n\nCCA/NCIT results\nThe Trojans appeared in both the 1974 CCA Tournament and the 1975 NCIT Tournament.

    "biography": "The Utah State Aggies men's basketball team represents Utah State University in NCAA Division I men\u2019s basketball. Founded in the 1903\u201304 season, the Aggies compete in the Mountain West Conference and play their home games at the 10,270-seat Dee Glen Smith Spectrum in Logan, Utah. Utah State will join the Pac-12 Conference beginning with the 2026-27 season. During Stew Morrill\u2019s 17-year tenure, the Aggies compiled a 193\u201313 (.937) home record, establishing one of the nation\u2019s toughest home-court advantages. As of the end of the 2024\u201325 season, the Aggies hold an all-time record of 1,740 wins and 1,164 losses (.599), following a 26\u20138 campaign that included a 15\u20135 conference mark and an average home attendance of 8,828 at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum.\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1902\u20131941)\nThe first basketball team on Utah State's campus was organized in 1902 and consisted of only women. A men's team was organized in 1904, at which point the women's club fell into obscurity.\n\nRise to prominence and the Wayne Estes era (1942\u20131971)\nThe Aggies enjoyed mixed success early in their history, notching sporadic NCAA tournament appearances and alternating between winning in the then-smaller postseason bracket and not winning much at all. Perhaps the most notable event in Utah State basketball history occurred on February 8, 1965, with the tragic death of Wayne Estes. Estes was a 6'6\" forward for the Aggies, and was the nation's second leading scorer in 1965, behind only Rick Barry, at 33.7 ppg. He had just amassed 2,000 career points with a 48-point showing in a home victory over the University of Denver, when he stopped at the scene of a car accident in Logan. While crossing the street, Estes accidentally clipped a downed power line with his head and was electrocuted. The Los Angeles Lakers had planned on drafting him in the 1st round of the NBA draft, where he likely would have gone on to win several championships with the team. Following Estes's death, he was posthumously awarded 1st team All-American honors.\n\nIndependence and national recognition (1972\u20131978)\nThe men's basketball team wasn't adversely affected by the constant shuffling of conference affiliations and independent status that blighted the USU football program throughout the mid-to-late 20th century. The program, however, did endure a lengthy stint as an independent program, from 1937 to 1978\u2014although in that period, basketball independence was not the financial and competitive obstacle that it would become in the ESPN era. All the while, it remained the most resilient and popular sport at USU, enjoying steady success for decades. During the 1960s and '70s, the Aggies spent a great deal of time in both major national polls, finishing the season in the AP Top 25 three times and in the Coaches' Poll Top 25 seven times. USU reached the NCAA Sweet 16 in 1962 and the Elite Eight in 1970. In 2024, the Aggies ranked 19th on the Coaches' Poll.\n\nThe Dee Glen Smith Spectrum and WAC success (1979\u20131998)\nThe Aggies enjoy a particularly strong home-court advantage at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, where they were 193\u201313 in the Morrill era. During the 1980s and 1990s, Utah State remained competitive through multiple conference realignments and earned an NCAA berth in 1988 under Kohn Smith and another in 1998 under Larry Eustachy. The program\u2019s success and fan support laid the groundwork for a resurgence entering the 21st century.\n\nThe Stew Morrill era (1999\u20132015)\nUnder head coach Stew Morrill, Utah State entered its most sustained period of modern success. Morrill led the Aggies to eight NCAA tournament appearances (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011), six conference titles, and 13 consecutive 23-win seasons. His teams were regularly ranked in national polls and established the Spectrum as one of college basketball\u2019s most difficult venues, amassing a 193\u201313 home record during his tenure.  \nDuring the 2008\u201309 season, USU led the nation in field goal percentage (49.8%) and finished second in win/loss percentage and fifth in assist-to-turnover ratio. In 2009\u201310, the Aggies led the nation in 3-point percentage (42.5%). They finished the 2011 season ranked #19 in the AP poll, a testament to Morrill\u2019s consistency and player development.\n\nModern Mountain West era (2015\u2013present)\nUtah State has also won the Old Oquirrh Bucket nine times, including both of the last two seasons. The Bucket is the award given each year to the best college basketball team in Utah, based on records against in-state opponents.\nCoaching eras in brief: Early coaches such as E. Lowell Romney (1920\u20131941) and LaDell Andersen (1962\u20131971) guided the Aggies to multiple NCAA appearances and established a foundation for success. The modern era of sustained winning began under Stew Morrill (1999\u20132015), who set the program record with 402 victories and led USU to eight NCAA tournaments and multiple league titles. After Morrill, Tim Duryea (2015\u20132018), Craig Smith (2019\u20132021), and Ryan Odom (2021\u20132023) stewarded the program through the Mountain West era. Danny Sprinkle led USU to a 28\u20137 season and the 2024 Round of 32 before departing, and Jerrod Calhoun was hired in 2024 and posted a 26\u20138 record in his first campaign.\n\nHead coaches\nThe Utah State men\u2019s basketball program has been led by a series of influential coaches since its inception in 1903. Early coaches such as E. Lowell Romney (1920\u20131941) and LaDell Andersen (1962\u20131971) laid the foundation for the program and guided the Aggies to multiple NCAA Tournament appearances.\nThe modern era of sustained success began under Stew Morrill, who coached from 1999 to 2015. Morrill led Utah State to eight NCAA Tournament appearances, six conference titles, and a school-record 402 wins, becoming the winningest coach in program history.\nFollowing Morrill, Tim Duryea (2015\u20132018) led the team during its transition into the Mountain West Conference; Craig Smith (2019\u20132021) restored national prominence with regular season titles and NCAA Tournament bids; and Ryan Odom (2021\u20132023) continued the program\u2019s momentum with another NCAA berth.\nIn April 2023, Utah State hired Danny Sprinkle as head coach. Sprinkle spent one season at USU (2023\u201324), during which the Aggies recorded a 28\u20137 record, won the Mountain West regular season title, and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Shortly after the season, Sprinkle departed to become head coach at the University of Washington.\nIn March 2024, the Aggies hired Jerrod Calhoun as head coach. Calhoun came to USU after a successful stint at Youngstown State and immediately led Utah State to a 26\u20138 record in his first season.\n\nHead coaching history\nThe following is a list of Utah State Aggies men's basketball head coaches and their records through the end of the 2024\u201325 season.\n\nNCAA = NCAA Tournament appearances; NIT = National Invitation Tournament appearances.\n\nArenas and traditions\nUtah State plays its home games at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, a 10,270-seat arena on the Utah State campus. The Aggies have compiled a 453\u2013105 (.812) record at the Spectrum, which has served as the program's home since 1970. Before its construction, Utah State's basketball teams played at the George Nelson Fieldhouse on campus. Under head coach Craig Smith, the Aggies were 39\u20134 (.910) at home. Until a surprising early-season loss in 2009, Utah State held the nation\u2019s second-longest home win streak (37 games), behind only Kansas.\nThe Dee Glen Smith Spectrum is known for its intimate atmosphere, with seats extending to court level and placing fans within feet of the action. The university reserves an unusually high percentage of these seats for students, helping cultivate one of the loudest and most creative student sections in college basketball. The student section\u2014known as The Hurd\u2014has been cited by multiple outlets as one of the toughest environments for visiting teams.\nIn the 1990s, when his Utah teams were competing for Final Four appearances, head coach Rick Majerus called the Spectrum the toughest arena in the country for his teams to play in. After a 2010 game in Logan, Wichita State head coach Gregg Marshall remarked, \u201cUtah State has 4,000 student tickets, and they make an impression. It\u2019s just a party\u2014one heck of a party. It\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever seen... I\u2019ve been to Duke, Kentucky, UConn, and Syracuse, and it\u2019s clearly the best atmosphere I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nAmong Utah State traditions are the \u201cI believe that we will win!\u201d chant and the \u201cWinning team, losing team\u201d chant, which humorously mocks opponents in the closing moments of home victories. An unofficial student publication, The Refraction, was distributed before each home game from 2007 to 2011, offering tongue-in-cheek analysis and crowd-engagement content.\nOne of Utah State\u2019s most recognizable fans, \u201cWild Bill\u201d Sproat, gained national attention for his humorous antics aimed at distracting opposing free-throw shooters.\n\nRivalries\nUtah State maintains several notable regional and conference rivalries that span decades and have shaped the Aggies\u2019 basketball identity. The most prominent rivalries include Nevada, Utah, BYU, UNLV, and Boise State \u2014 each marked by historic games, passionate fanbases, and conference implications.\n\nNevada\nUtah State\u2019s series with the Nevada Wolf Pack has grown into one of the Aggies\u2019 most competitive modern rivalries, dating back to Big West and WAC play and continuing in the Mountain West. Since 1951\u201352, Utah State leads the series 40\u201326, including a 24\u20137 mark in Logan.\nOne of the rivalry\u2019s signature moments came on March 2, 2019, when Utah State upset No. 12 Nevada 81\u201376 at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, clinching a share of the Mountain West regular-season title amid a raucous crowd.  \nThe series has remained high-stakes in recent years. In 2024\u201325, the Aggies swept the Wolf Pack, winning 69\u201364 in Reno on December 31, 2024, and 90\u201369 in Logan on January 22, 2025.\n\nUtah\nUtah State and the University of Utah share one of the oldest in-state rivalries in college basketball. The two programs have met more than 200 times since the early 1900s, with matchups taking place regularly until the 2010s.\nDuring the modern era, the series has featured numerous close games and alternating stretches of dominance. Utah State earned notable wins in 2004 (71\u201345 in Logan), 2008 (66\u201364 in Logan), and 2010 (79\u201362 in Logan), while Utah has won the most recent meetings, including a 77\u201367 victory in the 2017 Beehive Classic at Vivint Arena in Salt Lake City.\nDespite the schools\u2019 proximity and shared history, the rivalry has been played intermittently in recent years due to scheduling priorities and conference realignment. Coaches and fans on both sides have expressed interest in resuming the annual matchup, which remains one of the most recognized rivalries in Utah sports.\n\nBYU\nUtah State\u2019s long-standing rivalry with BYU dates back to the early 20th century and has produced more than 200 meetings. The schools, separated by just 120 miles, frequently battled as conference foes in the past and continue to meet periodically in non-conference play.\nBYU dominated much of the series in the 1990s and 2000s, but Utah State secured key home victories in 2009 (71\u201361) and 2011 (69\u201362) at the Smith Spectrum. The most recent meeting came in December 2021 in Provo, with BYU winning 82\u201371 before a crowd of more than 15,000.\n\nUNLV\nUtah State and UNLV share a rivalry that dates back to their Big West Conference days, highlighted by intense matchups in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The most infamous chapter came on March 1, 1990, in what became known as the \u201cWater Bomb Game,\u201d when dyed blue water erupted from a vent beneath the UNLV bench at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum.\nThe game came shortly after a fight-filled meeting in Las Vegas earlier that season, and UNLV went on to win 84\u201382 despite the disruption. The Rebels captured the national championship later that year, but the event cemented the series as one of the most colorful rivalries in college basketball. The teams renewed the matchup regularly after Utah State joined the Mountain West in 2013.\n\nBoise State\nUtah State\u2019s rivalry with the Boise State Broncos has intensified over the past two decades, carrying over from their time together in the WAC to the Mountain West. Since 1973\u201374, Utah State leads the series 39\u201322, including a 23\u20134 record in Logan.\nThe programs have become perennial contenders within the Mountain West, often meeting multiple times each season and occasionally in the conference tournament. Recent matchups include Utah State\u2019s 81\u201379 home win on January 11, 2025, and an 80\u201361 victory in Logan during the 2023\u201324 campaign.\nWhile Boise State has historically dominated the football rivalry, the basketball matchup has been far more balanced, often carrying conference title implications. Both schools are set to join the Pac-12 Conference in 2026, ensuring the regional rivalry will continue on a new stage.\n\nSeason-by-season results\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament\nUtah State has appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times, compiling a record of 7\u201327 (.206). The Aggies have earned tournament invitations in eight different decades, reflecting one of the most consistent programs among mid-major schools.\nUnder coach Larry Eustachy, Utah State returned to the NCAA Tournament in 1998 after a 12-year absence. The program then qualified eight times during Stew Morrill\u2019s tenure (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011), twice receiving at-large bids after losing the WAC championship game. Despite a 25\u20133 record and a national top-25 ranking in 2003\u201304, Utah State was controversially left out of the field, becoming the last-ranked team in NCAA history to miss the tournament.\nThe Aggies\u2019 most notable win came in the 2001 tournament, when they upset fifth-seeded Ohio State 77\u201368 in overtime before falling to UCLA in the second round. More recently, Utah State broke a 23-year drought without an NCAA Tournament win in 2024, defeating TCU 88\u201372 in the first round before falling to top-seeded Purdue in the second round.  \nIn 2025, under first-year head coach Jerrod Calhoun, the Aggies earned a No. 10 seed in the Mountain West\u2019s final season before conference realignment. Utah State fell in the first round to No. 7 seed UCLA, 72\u201347, concluding a 26\u20138 campaign that extended the program\u2019s streak of consecutive NCAA appearances to three.\n\nNIT\nThe Aggies have appeared in 10 National Invitation Tournaments, with a combined record of 2\u201310.\n\nCIT\nThe Aggies appeared in one CollegeInsider.com Tournament.

  "VCU Rams": {
    "biography": "The VCU Rams men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball team that represents Virginia Commonwealth University. The Rams joined the Atlantic 10 Conference in the 2012\u201313 season after previously competing in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). In 2017, VCU was ranked the 40th most valuable men's basketball program in the country by The Wall Street Journal.  With a valuation of $56.9 million, VCU ranked second in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and second in the A-10 Conference. The team is currently coached by Phil Martelli Jr.\nSince 1999, the team has played home basketball games at the E.J. Wade Arena at the Stuart C. Siegel Center in Richmond, Virginia on the university's Monroe Park campus. Virginia Commonwealth has made it to the NCAA Final Four once in its program's history, in 2011. Additionally, the Rams won the 2010 CBI tournament and have ten conference tournaments; three being in the Sun Belt Conference, five being in the Colonial Athletic Association, and two in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The Rams have also won twelve regular season championships; four from the Sun Belt, five from the CAA, and three in the Atlantic 10.  The official student supporter group is known as the Rowdy Rams.\nThe team is known for its Final Four run in the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.  While the team had made nine NCAA tournament appearances beforehand, never had the Rams made it beyond the second round of the tournament.  In 2011, the Rams' journey to the Final Four began in one of the four opening round games, commonly called \"play-in\" games, intended to narrow the field from 68 to 64 teams.  Thus, VCU became the first team to advance from the \"First Four\" to the Final Four.\nIn another NCAA tournament-first, VCU became the first team ever to forfeit a game in the NCAA tournament when their First Round game in the 2021 NCAA tournament was declared a no-contest due to several positive COVID-19 tests in the VCU program.\nVCU reached the NCAA tournament a state record seven consecutive times from 2011 to 2017.\n\nHistory\nThe VCU Rams men's basketball program was founded in 1968, at the same time as the merger of the Richmond Professional Institute and the Medical College of Virginia. In the 1968\u201369 season as an independent team, the program played its first ever season. Coached by Benny Dees and assisted by Landy Watson and Vann Brackin for their first two seasons, Dees led the team to two winning records, before being replaced by Chuck Noe. It would take 10 more seasons before the Rams appeared in a postseason tournament, earning a berth into the 1978 National Invitation tournament being eliminated in the first round by the University of Detroit.\nUnder the coaching of J.D. Barnett, the Rams earned fourth berths into the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, each being their first four berths, the first coming in 1980. During Barnett's six years coaching the team, only twice did the Rams not win the Sun Belt Conference.\nThe Rams became the first team to sweep the best of 3 championship series in the CBI post-season tournament on their way to becoming the 2010 CBI Champions.  It is the first post-season tournament championship, excluding conference tournaments, in the history of the program.\n\nThe Sun Belt Years\nVCU received their first bid to the NCAA tournament in the 1979\u20131980 season with an 18\u201312 overall record and Sun Belt Conference tournament championship led by then first-year VCU Head Coach J.D. Barnett in VCU's first season in the Sun Belt. They entered the tournament as a No. 12 seed in the East Region and were eliminated in the first round by No. 5 Iowa.\nIt would not be long before the Rams returned to the tournament. The following year the Rams posted a 24\u20135 record on their way to the Sun Belt Conference regular season and Conference tournament championships. The Rams entered the tournament as the No. 5 seed in the East region and defeated No. 12 Long Island before being eliminated by No. 4 Tennessee in overtime in the second round 58\u201356.\nThe Rams would return to the tournament in 1983. The Rams, the No. 5 seed in the East region, defeated No. 12 seed La Salle in the first round and were eliminated in the second round by No. 4 seed Georgia 56\u201354. The Rams lost their second-round game by the same margin to No. 4 Tennessee in 1981. The 1984 tournament held similar results for the Rams squad.  They entered the tournament as a No. 6 seed in the East Region and defeated No. 11 Northeastern before being eliminated by No. 3 Syracuse. The second-round losses in the NCAA tournament by VCU in 1981, 1983, and 1984 were to teams with first-round byes before the tournament expanded to 64 teams for the 1984\u20131985 season and byes were eliminated.\nIn the 1984\u201385 season the Rams once again made it to the newly expanded 1985 NCAA tournament.  The Rams entered the tournament as the No. 2 seed in the West region, the highest seeding they have ever received in the tournament.  The Rams defeated No. 15 Marshall in the first round, but unfortunately their luck had not changed in the second-round and they were upset by No. 7 Alabama 63\u201359.\nDuring his tenure, Head Coach J.D Barnett (1979\u20131985) led VCU and the Rams to five NCAA tournament appearances (1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1985) while capturing four Sun Belt regular season conference championships (1981, 1983, 1984, 1985) and three Sun Belt Conference tournament championships (1980, 1981, 1985).  He was 132\u201348 overall and 59\u201319 in conference play during his time at VCU.\nThe Rams next stint in the post-season came under Head Coach Mike Pollio in the 1988 NIT Tournament where they would reach the quarter-finals before ultimately falling to UConn 69\u201360.  The Rams posted wins over Marshall and Southern Mississippi in the first and second rounds, respectively.\nThe Rams remained in the Sun Belt Conference until 1991 when they joined the Metro Conference. VCU was left out of the 1995 merger of the Metro and Great Midwest Conference that created Conference USA. They instead joined the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) for the 1995\u20131996 season.\n\nThe CAA Days\nIn their first season as members of the CAA, the Rams posted a 24\u20139 overall record, going 14\u20132 in conference play en route to the CAA regular season and conference tournament championships. The Rams earned the right to go dancing in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1985, but fell in the first round as the No. 12 seed in the Southeast region to No. 5 Mississippi State.\n\nJeff Capel era\nThe VCU men's basketball team would return to prominence in the 2003\u20132004 season under then second-year Head Coach Jeff Capel. Following a 2nd place conference finish in his debut season, Capel led the Rams to a 23\u20138 overall record, going 14\u20134 in conference play and capturing the CAA regular season and conference tournament championships.  In the 2004 NCAA tournament, the Rams were awarded the No. 13 seed in the East region and faced No. 4 Wake Forest in the first round.  VCU led for much of the second half and had a chance to win towards the end despite the Wake Forest comeback, but ultimately fell 79\u201378.\nJeff Capel originally joined VCU as an assistant in 2001 and at the time of his promotion to the head coaching position in 2002 was the youngest head coach in Division I NCAA basketball at 27 years old. During his time as the head coach with VCU, Capel compiled a 79\u201341 record. In April 2006, Capel resigned as head coach to accept the same position with the University of Oklahoma Sooners. He was replaced by Anthony Grant, formerly an assistant and associate head coach for several years to Billy Donovan, including the 2006 NCAA champions, the University of Florida Gators.\n\nAnthony Grant era\nIn his first year as head coach, Anthony Grant led the Rams to a school-record 28 wins.  The Rams finished the season 28\u20137, also setting a school and CAA conference record with 16 wins in conference play.  Grant, who also set a school record for most wins by a first-year head coach, was named the CAA Coach of the Year.  The Rams were 16\u20132 in conference play and captured the CAA Regular season Championship before capturing the CAA Conference tournament Championship in thrilling fashion as Eric Maynor burst onto the national scene by scoring 9 points in the final 1:55 to bury the George Mason Patriots, finishing with 14 of his 20 points in the second half. Maynor also had 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in the victory.\nThe Rams entered the 2007 NCAA tournament as the No. 11 seed in the West region and upset the No. 6 seed Duke Blue Devils 79\u201377 on a game-winning bucket from just beyond the free-throw line by Eric Maynor in the final seconds of the game.\nThe Rams good fortune did not continue into the next round, however, where they were eliminated by the No. 3 seed Pittsburgh Panthers.  The Rams squad showed outstanding poise in the second-half by forcing overtime after trailing 41\u201326 at halftime.  They would go on to lose by a score of 84\u201379.\nThe next year the Rams would win their second straight CAA regular season championship, posting a 24\u20138 overall record, 15\u20133 in conference play, but fall short in the conference tournament in a heartbreaking upset to William & Mary in the semi-finals.  The Rams missed an at-large bid for the NCAA tournament but instead received an invitation to play in the NIT.  The Rams heartbreak continued as they were upset on their home court in the first round by old-time Sun Belt Conference rival, the UAB Blazers 80\u201377 as a late comeback fell just short.\nThe 2008\u20132009 season was another successful one for the VCU program.  The Rams finished the season with a mark of 24\u201310 overall, going 14\u20134 in a hotly contested CAA and sealing the deal on a three-peat as CAA regular season champions for only the second time in CAA conference history and the second time in school history, the first coming during the Rams time in the Sun Belt Conference.  The Rams would not fall short again and captured the CAA Conference tournament championship for the fourth time since joining the conference capped by a 71\u201350 rout of rival George Mason in the final.  The 21-point margin is the largest margin of victory in a CAA Conference tournament Championship Game.  Larry Sanders set CAA Conference tournament Championship Game records for the Rams with 20 rebounds and 7 blocks in the victory.\nSo once again, the Rams headed to the NCAA tournament as a No. 11 seed in the East region.  The Rams were eliminated by the No. 6 seed UCLA Bruins in a hard-fought game 65\u201364.\nAnthony Grant posted an impressive 76\u201325 record in his three seasons as the head men's basketball coach at VCU.  He was an outright dominating 52\u201310 versus CAA opponents, including conference tournaments, capturing three straight CAA Regular season Conference Championships and two CAA Conference tournament championships. He led VCU to two NCAA tournament berths and one NIT berth before departing the program to take over the head coaching position at the University of Alabama. Eric Maynor would go on to be drafted No. 20 in the 2009 NBA draft by the Utah Jazz.\n\nShaka Smart era\nFrom 2009 to 2015, the Rams were led by Shaka Smart, who had been previously an assistant coach for the Florida Gators men's basketball team. Prior to Florida, Smart served as an assistant coach at Clemson, Akron and California (Pa.) and a director of operations at Dayton.  During his introductory press conference, he promised that his teams would \"wreak havoc on our opponents [sic] psyche and their plan of attack.\" Smart's teams have employed a basketball philosophy nicknamed Havoc since that point.\nIn Smart's first year as the Rams head coach, the team posted a 27\u20139 record, going 11\u20137 in the CAA, finishing fifth in the conference. As fifth seeds, the Rams made it to the semi-finals of the 2010 CAA men's basketball tournament before falling to their conference rivals, Old Dominion, who would go on to win the CAA Championship. Despite reaching the semifinals of the CAA Tournament, the Rams did not earn a berth into either the NCAA or NIT tournaments. However, the Rams earned a berth into the 2010 College Basketball Invitational, where they would finish as the eventual champions, defeating Saint Louis 2\u20130 in the series final. Their sweep of Saint Louis made it the first time in CBI history a team won the best two-out-of-three championship series in two games. Additionally, it was VCU's first postseason tournament, other than the Sun Belt and CAA tournaments, that the program won.\nOn Selection Sunday 2011, the VCU Rams received an at-large bid to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament to start off the newly created 68-team field. VCU found itself as one of the last teams in the tournament and was scheduled to play in the newly formed \"First Four\" against USC on March 16 for a spot as the 11th seed in the tournament. The inclusion of VCU in the tournament was widely criticized by pundits and the ESPN network, in particular Jay Bilas and Dick Vitale. In the first round of the NCAA tournament, dubbed by many as \"The First Four\", The Rams succeeded in knocking off USC by the score of 59\u201346. The Rams blew out Georgetown 74\u201356 in Chicago to reach the Round of 32 and followed this win up with a 94\u201376 rout of third-seeded Purdue to advance to VCU's first-ever Sweet Sixteen appearance. VCU then beat Florida State 72\u201371 in overtime on a last second shot by Bradford Burgess to advance to the school's first ever Elite Eight appearance.\nThe Rams upset the number one seeded Kansas Jayhawks 71\u201361 to reach the Final Four for the first time ever. VCU, the Southwest Regional champions played in the National Semifinal against the Southeast Region champion Butler Bulldogs, losing 70\u201362. The VCU Rams finished sixth in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll at the end of the season. This was the highest ranking in VCU's history and the highest ranking of any team from the CAA.  The 2011 NCAA tournament run by VCU is regarded as one of the best Cinderella runs of all time. Their First Four appearance, combined with their run to the Final Four, gave VCU the distinction of being the first team to win five games in the men's NCAA tournament without reaching the championship game.\n\nThe Atlantic 10 Days\nThe major conference realignment of the early 2010s eventually gave VCU the opportunity for a major basketball upgrade. After A10 mainstay Temple announced its departure for the Big East Conference and Charlotte announced it would return to Conference USA, the A10 reloaded by adding Butler and VCU. The move placed VCU in a conference that regularly collected NCAA at-large bids\u2014the A10 had 20 teams earn at-large bids from 2000 through 2012, including three in the 2012 tournament. By comparison, the CAA had only four at-large bids in the same period (one of them being VCU's 2011 Final Four team).\nOn Sunday, March 15, 2015, VCU won its first Atlantic 10 conference tournament championship.\nOn April 2, 2015, Smart left VCU to go to the University of Texas.\n\nWill Wade era\nAfter two seasons at Chattanooga, Will Wade returned to VCU to take the open head coaching position vacated by Shaka Smart.  In his first season returning to VCU, Wade guided the team to their first ever A10 Conference regular season championship and a 25\u201311 overall record.  VCU made it to the championship game of the A10 conference tournament for the 4th straight season, falling to St. Joseph's.  The team won at least 24 games, VCU and Kansas are the only NCAA schools to reach that feat the last 10 seasons.  The Rams also made their 6th straight NCAA tournament, one of only 8 teams in the country to do so.  VCU made it to the round of 32 where they fell to Oklahoma 85\u201381.  Wade finished second in voting for A10 coach of the year. Wade announced that he was leaving VCU after two years to accept the head coaching position at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.\n\nMike Rhoades era\nOn  March 21, 2017, VCU announced that the school had hired former associate head coach under Shaka Smart, Mike Rhoades, as the Rams' new head basketball coach.  He was formerly the head coach at Rice University in Houston.  He is the 12th coach in program history.\nOn  March 29, 2023, Mike Rhoades announced he was accepting an offer to coach at Penn State following 6 seasons at VCU and 0 NCAA tournament wins. Hours after his announced departure all key VCU players declared for the transfer portal  leaving VCU with just 5 active roster players.\n\nRyan Odom era\nIn March 2023, VCU named Utah State coach Ryan Odom as the Rams new head coach. In his two years at VCU he led the team to a 52\u201321 record.  In Odom's first season, the Rams finished 24-14 and advanced to the 2024 National Invitation Tournament Quarterfinals.  In the Odom's second season, the Rams won both the Atlantic 10 Conference regular-season and Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament championships, winning 18 of their final 20 games en route to a No. 11 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they lost to No. 6 seed Brigham Young in the first round. Odom was named the men's basketball coach for the Virginia Cavaliers on March 21, 2025.\n\nCoaches\nIn the team's existence, the Rams have had 12 different head coaches. Benny Dees coached the team for the first two seasons of existence. During Dees' tenure, the team achieved winning records both seasons, but barely pulled ahead of .500, resulting in Dees being fired. The second coach, Chuck Noe, led the team for the next six seasons.\nFollowing Noe's departure as head coach in 1976, Dana Kirk became the third head coach in Rams basketball history. Kirk, formerly assistant to Denny Crum, was part of the University of Louisville team that reached the Final Four in 1976. In Kirk's second season with the team, he led them to a 24\u20135 record, and a berth into the National Invitational Tournament, making it the first time the team reached any major tournament. Although the team was eliminated in the first round, the success of the program Kirk built continued into the following season. Kirk's success with the Rams resulted in him being hired as the head coach at Memphis State (now Memphis) in 1979.\nSubsequently, the Rams earned an invitation to play in the Sun Belt Conference and hired J. D. Barnett as their head coach. Barnett, who coached the team from 1979 through 1985, immediately brought NCAA success to the team, earning berths into the NCAA tournament five of the six seasons in his tenure, as well as being the four-time Sun Belt champions. Barnett\u2019s success eventually led to him being offered a contract to coach at Tulsa.\nMike Pollio became the fifth coach in Rams history. The head coach from 1985 until 1989, Pollio had a rather lackluster record with the team. During his four years as coach, Pollio had two seasons with losing records, the first in Rams history. During his four years, Pollio managed to get the team into the NIT quarterfinals.\n\nFacilities\nThe Rams play at the E.J. Wade Arena, formerly Verizon Wireless Arena, the Stuart C. Siegel Center, located in the northwest corridor of the Monroe Park campus. University-owned, the Siegel Center broke ground for construction April 1996, and opened three years later, in May 1999.  Since the 1999\u201300 season, the venue has been the home arena for the Rams, as well as the women's basketball team and volleyball team.\nPrior to the opening of the Siegel Center, the Rams spent a majority of their history playing their home basketball games in the Richmond Coliseum, which housed the team from 1971 until 1999. Prior to the Rams' long-term occupation of the Coliseum, the team played their home games in the Franklin Street Gym.\n\nPractice facility\nA $25 million practice facility located on the north side of Marshall Street adjacent to the Siegel Center was completed in November 2015. Replacing the decades-old Franklin Street Gym, it houses the Men's and Women's basketball teams. The building's size is about 62,000 square feet (5,800 m2) and features courts, players' lounges, dining areas, coaches' offices, retail spaces, and a hall of fame.\n\nRivals\nThe Rams have three major rivals: Old Dominion, George Mason and their long-standing crosstown rival University of Richmond.\nIn the 1970s, their first six games were decided at the buzzer. For the past 35 years, the two schools have competed annually in the Capital City Classic (formerly Black & Blue Classic).  The success of the two school's basketball programs was highlighted in the 2011 NCAA tournament, as Richmond and VCU respectively reached the Sweet Sixteen and Final Four.\n\nPlayers\nHonored jerseys\nVCU has honored six players by retiring their jerseys, although the numbers remained active:\n\nIndividual career records\nPoints\nEric Maynor \u2013 1,953\nTreveon Graham \u2013 1,882\nKendrick Warren \u2013 1,858\nCharles Wilkins \u2013 1,716\nBradford Burgess \u2013 1,684\nMelvin Johnson \u2013 1,657\nPhil Stinnie \u2013 1,645\nCalvin Duncan \u2013 1,630\nDomonic Jones \u2013 1,616\nJesse Dark \u2013 1,584\n\nRebounds\nLorenza Watson \u2013 1,143\nKendrick Warren \u2013 1,049\nJustin Tillman \u2013 922\nJuvonte Reddic \u2013 895\nBernard Harris \u2013 839\nTreveon Graham \u2013 803\n\nAssists\nEric Maynor \u2013 674\nEd Sherod \u2013 582\nJoey Rodriguez \u2013 580\nRolando Lamb \u2013 550\nLaMar Taylor \u2013 527\nJeQuan Lewis \u2013 505\nDarius Theus \u2013 462\nDave Edwards \u2013 430\nSherman Hamilton \u2013 417\nCalvin Duncan \u2013 404\n\nSteals\nBriant\u00e9 Weber \u2013 374 *\nRolando Lamb \u2013 257\nJoey Rodriguez \u2013 237\nDarius Theus \u2013 237\nJeQuan Lewis \u2013 205\nEd Sherod \u2013 202\nLaMar Taylor \u2013 193\nEric Maynor \u2013 168\nJuvonte Reddic \u2013 160\nRob Brandenberg \u2013 159\n\nBlocked shots\nLorenza Watson \u2013 391\nLarry Sanders \u2013 277\nMo Alie-Cox \u2013 255\nL.

    "summary": "The VCU Rams men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball team that represents Virginia Commonwealth University. The Rams joined the Atlantic 10 Conference in the 2012\u201313 season after previously competing in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). In 2017, VCU was ranked the 40th most valuable men's basketball program in the country by The Wall Street Journal.  With a valuation of $56.9 million, VCU ranked second in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and second in the A-10 Conference. The team is currently coached by Phil Martelli Jr.\nSince 1999, the team has played home basketball games at the E.J. Wade Arena at the Stuart C. Siegel Center in Richmond, Virginia on the university's Monroe Park campus. Virginia Commonwealth has made it to the NCAA Final Four once in its program's history, in 2011. Additionally, the Rams won the 2010 CBI tournament and have ten conference tournaments; three being in the Sun Belt Conference, five being in the Colonial Athletic Association, and two in the Atlantic 10 Conference. The Rams have also won twelve regular season championships; four from the Sun Belt, five from the CAA, and three in the Atlantic 10.  The official student supporter group is known as the Rowdy Rams.\nThe team is known for its Final Four run in the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.  While the team had made nine NCAA tournament appearances beforehand, never had the Rams made it beyond the second round of the tournament.  In 2011, the Rams' journey to the Final Four began in one of the four opening round games, commonly called \"play-in\" games, intended to narrow the field from 68 to 64 teams.  Thus, VCU became the first team to advance from the \"First Four\" to the Final Four.\nIn another NCAA tournament-first, VCU became the first team ever to forfeit a game in the NCAA tournament when their First Round game in the 2021 NCAA tournament was declared a no-contest due to several positive COVID-19 tests in the VCU program.\nVCU reached the NCAA tournament a state record seven consecutive times from 2011 to 2017.",

    "biography": "The Villanova Wildcats men's basketball program represent Villanova University in men's college basketball and competes in the Big East Conference of NCAA Division I. Their first season was the 1920\u201321 season. Named the Wildcats, Villanova is a member of the Philadelphia Big Five, five Philadelphia college basketball teams who share a passionate rivalry.\nThe Wildcats have won the national championship three times: 1985, 2016, and 2018. Their 1985 NCAA championship victory as an 8 seed still stands as the lowest seed ever to win the title. The championship game of that year is referred to as \"The Perfect Game\" as they shot a championship game record 78.6% as a team for the game (22 for 28, including 9 for 10 in the second half). Their 2016 NCAA Championship is referred to as \"The Perfect Ending\" and became the second of only two NCAA Men's Championship games to be won on a buzzer beater when Kris Jenkins drained a shot as time expired. They made the Final Four in 1939, 1971, 1985, 2009, 2016, 2018, and 2022; their six Final Four appearances are 13th most all-time. As of 2019, they have an NCAA Tournament record of 65\u201337 (.637). \nVillanova has defeated six No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament (Michigan and Georgetown in 1985, Pittsburgh in 2009, Kansas and North Carolina in 2016, and Kansas in 2018), which is sixth most all-time. The Villanova Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA tournament 39 times, the eighth highest total in NCAA history. They have won the Big East regular season championship eight times, most recently winning four straight from 2014 to 2017. They won the Big East tournament in 1995, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022. Through 2021, Villanova has 1,817 wins, which is 19th among Division I men's basketball teams and is tied for 9th in all time winning percentage at (.657). Villanova has won the Philadelphia Big Five 27 times, and is tied with Temple University for the most of any team, including five straight from 2014 to 2018. The Wildcats have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament 18 times, winning in 1994.\n\nBy the numbers\nNCAA national championships \u2013 3\nNCAA Championship Game appearances \u2013 4\nNCAA Final Four \u2013 7\nNCAA Elite Eight \u2013 14\nNCAA Sweet Sixteen \u2013 18\nNCAA Tournament Appearances \u2013 39\nNational Coach of the Year \u2013 2\nConference regular season Championships \u2013 12\nAll-Americans \u2013 20\nWeeks Ranked as AP #1 Team \u2013 19\n30-Win Seasons \u2013 5\nPhiladelphia Big 5 Championships \u2013 25\nPhiladelphia Big 5 Player of the Year \u2013 20\nWinning Seasons \u2013 78\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1920\u20131936)\nVillanova began its varsity basketball program in 1920. Michael Saxe coached for six seasons, from 1920 to 1926, compiling a 64\u201330 record (.681). John Cashman coached three seasons, from 1926 to 1929, compiling a 21\u201326 record (.447). George \"Doc\" Jacobs coached seven seasons, from 1929 to 1936, and had a 62\u201356 record (.525).\nThe team played its first game in 1920 in Alumni Hall on Villanova's campus, beating Catholic University 43\u201340.  In the early years, Villanova's home courts were Alumni Hall and West Catholic High School.  In 1932, The Wildcats moved into the Villanova Field House\u2014now known as the Jake Nevin Field House, which was named after Villanova's long-time trainer.  Villanova also played many home games at the Palestra on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania beginning in 1929. The Wildcats played home games in both the Villanova Field House and the Palestra until 1986.\n\nAl Severance era (1936\u20131961)\nAl Severance coached Villanova for 25 seasons, from 1936 to 1961.  It was under Severance's leadership that Villanova's basketball program rose to prominence.  Severance compiled a 413\u2013201 record (.673).\nThe 1938\u201339 team won the first-ever NCAA Tournament game, which put them in the inaugural Final Four.  Severance led the Wildcats to the NCAA tournament again in 1949, 1951, and 1955.  Villanova earned NIT bids in 1959 and 1960.\nThe most storied player in Villanova history, Paul Arizin, played during this era.  Severance discovered Arizin, already a Villanova student, playing basketball in the Villanova Fieldhouse. Arizin holds the Villanova record for most points in a game (85), and is credited with inventing the jump shot and was the 1949 College Player of the Year.\nOther notable players from the Severance era include Joe Lord, Larry Hennessy, Bob Schafer and George Raveling.\nCoincidentally, Severance died on April 1, 1985, which was the same day that Villanova upset Georgetown University and Patrick Ewing to take the NCAA basketball championship.\n\n1939 Final Four\nThe inaugural NCAA tournament featured eight teams from throughout the country.  Villanova, representing the Mid-Atlantic states, beat Brown, representative of the New England States, 43\u201340 before a crowd of 3,500 at the Palestra.  The following night, the Wildcats lost to Ohio State 53\u201336 in the Eastern Division championship.\n\nJack Kraft era (1961\u20131973)\nJack Kraft coached Villanova for 12 years, from 1961 through 1973.  He compiled a 238\u201395 record (.715).  Kraft led Villanova to the NCAA tournament six times, and five times to the NIT.  Only once did Kraft's teams fail to earn a post-season bid, in his final season.\nNotable players during the Jack Kraft era include: Chris Ford, Tom Ingelsby, Wali Jones, Bill Melchionni, Howard Porter, Jim Washington, and Hubie White.\n\n1971 NCAA Finalist\nOn March 27, 1971, Villanova made its first appearance in an NCAA basketball tournament championship game.  The unheralded Wildcats took on the legendary John Wooden and his mighty UCLA Bruins.  The 28\u20131 UCLA squad featured Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe, Henry Bibby, and Steve Patterson.  Going into the title game, the Bruins had won six of the previous seven NCAA championships, including the previous four.\nJack Kraft's Villanova squad, nicknamed the \"Iron Men\", was made up of just nine players.  Led by Howard Porter, Clarence Smith, Hank Siemiontkowski, Chris Ford, Tom Ingelsby, Bob Gohl, Mike Daley, John Fox and Joe McDowell. Villanova amassed a 27\u20136 record, including a shocking 90\u201347 victory over a previously undefeated powerhouse Penn squad.\nVillanova fought from behind for most of the game, twice cutting the lead to three in the final minutes.  Villanova lost by six, 68\u201362.  Up to that time, the six-point loss was the narrowest spread of UCLA's six NCAA title game victories.\nDespite the loss, Villanova's Howard Porter was named the Tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Porter was later stripped of the award and the team's NCAA victories were vacated after it was discovered that Porter had violated NCAA rules because he had signed a professional contract with the Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association during the middle of his senior year.\n\nRollie Massimino era (1973\u20131992)\nDuring Rollie Massimino's tenure, the Villanova Wildcats abandoned their traditional independent status by joining the newly formed Eastern Eight Conference in 1975.  In 1980, the Wildcats moved into the new Big East Conference, along with Georgetown, St. John's, and Syracuse.  The 1980s were the golden age of the Big East, highlighted by the 1985 NCAA tournament, when Villanova, Georgetown, and St. John's all reached the Final Four.\nMassimino's teams had tremendous success in the NCAA tournament, usually in an underdog role. He led the Wildcats to the NCAA tournament 11 times, winning in 1985, and his teams reached the Elite Eight five times in an 11-year span: 1978, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1988.  Massimino's teams were well-prepared for the tournament, always playing a difficult schedule and emphasizing tenacious defense.  Massimino lost the opening game in the NCAA tournament only once, to Shaquille O'Neal and Chris Jackson-led LSU in 1990, and he remarkably never lost to a lower-seeded team.\nMassimino coached for 19 seasons at Villanova, compiling a record of 357\u2013241 (.596).  In the NCAA tournament, Massimino had a 20\u201310 record (.667).\nNotable players from the Massimino era include Alex Bradley, Stewart Granger, Keith Herron, Dwayne McClain, Harold Jensen, Ed Pinckney, John Pinone, Harold Pressley, Rory Sparrow, and Doug West.\nIn 1976, the Wildcats played their first game in the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Because of the greater seating capacity, Villanova generally played a few home games each year at the Spectrum until the opening of what is now known as the Xfinity Mobile Arena. Villanova christened its current home court as John Eleuth\u00e8re du Pont Pavilion, now the Pavilion, with a 64\u201362 victory over Maryland on February 1, 1986.\n\n1985 National Champions\nIn 1985, under the direction of Massimino, the men's basketball team completed one of the most surprising runs in NCAA tournament history by winning the national championship in the first year of the 64-team field. The eighth-seeded Wildcats (unranked in the final AP poll) beat Dayton (at Dayton), top-seeded Michigan, Maryland and second-seeded North Carolina to win the Southeast Regional en route to the Final Four in Lexington, Kentucky. After defeating 2-seed Memphis State in the national semifinals, Villanova met defending champion Georgetown, a 10-favorite led by Patrick Ewing, in the title game on April 1, 1985. \nTop-seeded Georgetown had beaten conference rival Villanova twice during the regular season, and had reached the title game with tenacious defense, which gave up less than 40% of their opponents' shots from the field in both the regular season and the postseason. Before the championship game, Massimino told his team they had to play a perfect game in order to beat Georgetown.  In perhaps the greatest shooting performance in NCAA history, the Wildcats went 22-of-28 from the field to convert a blistering 78.6% of their shots, including a second half where they missed only one basket. The Hoyas hung tough, converting 55% of their 53 attempts, but were unable to overcome the astounding shooting performance as Villanova won 66\u201364 to claim the NCAA championship. The Wildcat squad remains the only eight-seed and the lowest overall seed in tournament history to win the championship, and their overall team shooting percentage remains an NCAA tournament record for a single game. The game is often cited among the greatest upsets in college basketball history. Ed Pinckney, who shot 5-of-7 and had 16 points in the game, was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. This game is featured in the book The Perfect Game by Frank Fitzpatrick.\n\nSteve Lappas era (1992\u20132001)\nLappas compiled a very respectable record of 174\u2013110 (.613) during his years at Villanova.  The 1994 and 1995 teams, led by Kerry Kittles, Jason Lawson, Eric Eberz, and Alvin Williams, won the NIT and Big East tournaments, respectively.  The 1995 Big East tournament title was capped by a decisive victory over a Connecticut team that had been ranked Number 1 during the regular season before being defeated on the Huskies home court by Villanova. This represents the one and only time Villanova won the original Big East tournament before the Conference was reconfigured in 2013.\nUnder Coach Lappas, Villanova reached the NCAA tournament in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1999, compiling a disappointing 2\u20134 record and never advancing beyond the second round. After a 2001 First round NIT loss at Minnesota, junior center Michael Bradley announced he was forgoing his final year of eligibility to enter the NBA draft, essentially leaving Villanova without a returning star player. Shortly thereafter, Hofstra coach and former Massimino assistant Jay Wright became available, and the Administration decided a coaching change would benefit all parties. Lappas left Villanova to pursue other opportunities, ultimately becoming a respected television analyst for CBS coverage of NCAA basketball, and has been welcomed back with open arms to the Villanova basketball family.\nNotable players in the Lappas era include Michael Bradley, Kerry Kittles, Jason Lawson, Tim Thomas, John Celestand and Alvin Williams and Eric Eberz.\nDuring the Lappas-era, Villanova began playing a few major home games at Xfinity Mobile Arena beginning in 1996. Villanova's first game in the new arena was a December 1996 loss to the Duke Blue Devils. Xfinity Mobile Arena was known as the CoreStates Center, the First Union Center, the Wachovia Center, and the Wells Fargo Center before it adopted its current name.\n\nJay Wright era (2001\u20132022)\nJay Wright was named Villanova's head coach in 2001.  As Rollie Massimino's assistant from 1987 through 1992, he was well-acquainted with Villanova.  Prior to his hiring by Villanova, Wright was head coach at Hofstra. \nVillanova earned a post-season tournament berth in each of Wright's initial ten seasons as Villanova head coach before missing in 2011\u201312.  The Wildcats played in the NIT in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and in 14 of 15 NCAA Tournaments since 2005. Wright's Villanova teams have reached 6 Regionals, 4 Final Fours and have won 2 National Championships. During Wright's tenure, Villanova has compiled a 34\u201313 record in the NCAA tournament, crowned with the 2016 and 2018 National Championships.  Six of Wright's NCAA Tournament losses at Villanova have been to the eventual National Champion.\nOne of the highlights of his tenure was an amazing run to the 2009 Final Four when Villanova beat #1 seeded Pittsburgh to win the Elite 8 on a coast-to-coast buzzer beating layup by team captain Scottie Reynolds.  Villanova subsequently lost the national semifinals to eventual NCAA Champion North Carolina.\nStrong starts to the 2009\u201310 and 2010\u201311 seasons were followed by struggling finishes. Villanova barely beat Robert Morris in overtime before taking losses at the hands of St Mary's (2010) and George Mason (2011) in NCAA Tournament play. Villanova had a rebuilding 2011\u201312 season, compiling a 13\u201319 record and missing a post-season bid for the only time in Wright's tenure.\nA young nucleus in 2012\u201313 was a portent of future glory and saw the Wildcats make a return trip to the 2013 NCAA tournament where they fell to once-and-future foe North Carolina. Still, a #2 seed in 2013\u201314 and a #1 seed in 2014\u201315 preceded second round NCAA exits at the hands of Connecticut (2014) and N.C. State (2015) causing Nova Nation some well-publicized consternation. The 2016 and 2018 Championship runs put the \"underachiever\" tag to the sword, cementing Wright's Villanova legacy as the program's greatest mentor. The 2016 National Championship victory was accomplished on the strength of Kris Jenkin's NBA-range 3 point buzzer bomb, thwarting North Carolina. The 2018 Championship win over Michigan culminated a six-game NCAA tournament run in which no opponent finished within a dozen points of the Wildcats.\nNotable players during the Jay Wright era include Randy Foye, Kyle Lowry, Dante Cunningham, Allan Ray, Mike Nardi, Will Sheridan, Curtis Sumpter, Scottie Reynolds, Corey Fisher, JayVaughn Pinkston, Darrun Hilliard, 2016 champions including Final Four most outstanding player Ryan Arcidiacono, Daniel Ochefu, Kris Jenkins and Josh Hart. Four Villanova players from the 2018 championship team were drafted by the NBA\u2014national player of the year and Final Four most outstanding player Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, Donte Divincenzo and Omari Spellman. National title holdovers Phil Booth and Eric Paschall keyed Villanova' surprising run to the 2019 Big East Regular Season and tournament championships. In the 2019 NCAA Tournament, six seed Villanova gained a measure of revenge against St. Mary's with a first-round victory followed by a loss to Purdue, a strong 3 seed, in the second round. Booth ended his Villanova career as the all-time winningest player in program history with 2 national titles and 4 Big East tournament championships (2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019).\n\n2004\u201305 season\nUnder coach Jay Wright, Villanova's men's basketball team reached the 2005 NCAA Tournament Sweet 16, defeating New Mexico and Florida before losing to #1 seed and eventual champion North Carolina by one point. Junior Forward Curtis Sumpter was injured in the Florida game and did not return to the court until the 2006\u201307 season. There is controversy surrounding a disputed traveling call against Allan Ray made in the closing seconds of the UNC game. With under a minute left and Villanova down by three, Ray drove and made a shot. There was contact with a UNC defender and a whistle. Most assumed the whistle signified a foul on Carolina, giving Ray a chance to tie the game with the resultant free-throw. Incredibly, the officials ruled that Ray committed a traveling violation prior to taking the shot, negating the basket, and rendering Kyle Lowry's buzzer beating 3 pointer a mere footnote to a painful loss. In an ironic twist of fate, Booth, late in the 2016 National Championship game (also against North Carolina), made a crucial \"and one\" three point opportunity denied Allan Ray 12 years earlier.\n\n2005\u201306 season\nLed by senior guards Randy Foye and Allan Ray as well as sophomore guard Kyle Lowry, the Villanova men's basketball team began the 2005\u20132006 year ranked #4 in the major polls from USA Today and the Associated Press. Having lost only three regular season games, the Wildcats enjoyed a #1 seed in the 2006 tournament\u2014their first.\nThe Wildcats' wins over Monmouth, Arizona, and Boston College brought them back to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1988.  Villanova's 75\u201362 upset loss in Minneapolis to eventual champion Florida ended the team's run toward a Regional Final.  The loss to Florida was the second consecutive year that Villanova was eliminated in the NCAA tournament by the eventual national champion.  The Wildcats' 28 wins during the 2006 campaign was the second most victories for any Villanova Men's Basketball team at that time.  Foye, Ray and Lowry all entered the NBA following the season.\n\n2006\u201307 season\nWright's 2006\u20132007 team was composed mainly of freshmen and sophomores who, at times, struggled to mesh.  The Wildcats improved throughout the season, due in large part to the emergence of freshman Scottie Reynolds.  Villanova finished the 2006\u201307 season with a record of 22\u201311.  The Wildcats earned an at-large bid to the 2007 NCAA Tournament, where they lost in the second round to the Kentucky Wildcats.  Villanova's 2006\u201307 free throw percentage of .781 led the NCAA, and set a Villanova season record.\n\n2007\u201308 season\nThe 2007\u201308 campaign was an erratic one for the young Wildcats, a team with no seniors.  After a promising 9\u20131 start, Villanova had a rough start to its Big East season.  In mid-season, the Wildcats lost five consecutive games by double digits and lost 6 of 7 games during a 3-week span in the middle of the season, as the freshmen struggled to adjust to the college game, and the experienced players encountered difficulties in adjusting to leadership positions. In February and March, as the players became more comfortable within Coach Wright's system, and with improved defense, the team began to win.\nA win against Syracuse in the Big East tournament was good enough for the Wildcats to secure one of the final at-large bids to the NCAA tournament. Villanova proved it was worthy of the bid when an upset over Clemson and a victory over Siena put them in the final 16 teams in the tournament, where they lost to eventual National Champion Kansas.\n\n2008\u201309 season\nMost notable in the 2008\u201309 season was the rise to prominence of senior forward Dante Cunningham.  Cunningham averaged 16.1 points per game, an increase of nearly 6 points over the previous season.  He also managed to average 7.5 rebounds, 1.2 blocks, and 1.2 steals per game.  Cunningham was honored as the Big East Most Improved Player.  His teammate, tenacious sophomore guard Corey Fisher, was also honored as the Big East Sixth Man of the Year for his contributions off the bench.\nThe Wildcats finished the regular season with a mark of 26\u20137, earning a school record for most regular season victories.  They lost their final regular season game to the Louisville Cardinals, 69\u201355, in the fourth round, or semi-finals of the Big East tournament.  The Wildcats began the NCAA tournament at the Wachovia Center, a secondary venue for home games.  They survived an early scare by American to handily beat two of college basketball's most prestigious programs, UCLA and Duke, in the rounds of 32 and 16 by a combined margin of 43 points.\nVillanova won a very close match up against number 1 seed Pittsburgh in the Elite 8 round of the tournament, with guard Scottie Reynolds racing down the court to make a layup with only 0.5 seconds left. Pitt took the final shot, which bounced off the backboard to end the game.  The last-second basket by Reynolds was widely hailed as one of the most exciting plays of that year's tournament, with Sports Illustrated's Seth Davis calling the victory \"one of the great games in NCAA tournament history\".  Villanova advanced to the Final Four where they faced the North Carolina Tar Heels.  Villanova fell to the Tar Heels in the national semifinals at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, by a final score of 83\u201369. This was the fourth time in five years that Villanova's tournament ouster was by the eventual national champion.\nThe Wildcats' record of 30\u20138 broke a previous high for most victories in a season, a distinction previously held by the 2005\u201306 Wildcats squad.  The senior class of 2009, composed of forwards Dante Cunningham, Shane Clark, Dwayne Anderson and Frank Tchuisi, earned the distinction of being the winningest senior class in school history.\n\n2009\u201310 season\nThe Wildcats enjoyed another highly successful regular season, finishing with a record of 24\u20137 and earning a #2 Seed in the NCAA tournament. They lost in the first round of the Big East tournament to Marquette and required overtime to defeat 15th seeded Robert Morris University in the opening round of the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were defeated in the 2nd round by the 10th seeded St. Mary's Gaels.\nScottie Reynolds ended his career as the second-leading scorer in Villanova history with 2,222 points, 21 points short of breaking Kerry Kittles's all-time record. He finished his college career with 472 assists and 203 steals. Reynolds was named to the 2010 AP All-American 1st team, but was not selected in the NBA draft.\n\n2016 National Champions\nThe Wildcats enjoyed another highly successful regular season and held the AP #1 ranking in the nation for the first time in school history over a 3-week period. They finished the regular season with a 27\u20134 record losing only to teams (Oklahoma, Virginia, Providence, Xavier) that were ranked at the time of the match-up. Villanova finished Big East Conference play 16\u20132 for the third year in a row also garnering their 3rd straight outright Regular Season Conference Title.\nAfter losing in the Big East tournament championship Game to Seton Hall, 69\u201367, the Wildcats earned a 2 seed in the NCAA tournament South Region where they dispatched the #15 seeded UNC Asheville by 30 points, followed by a 19-point win over #7 seed Iowa.  After defeating #3 seed Miami by 23, they moved on to the Elite Eight to face the overall #1 seed Kansas Jayhawks.  The Wildcats defense shined as they won by 5 points to advance to their 5th Final Four and the first since 2009.  They faced #2 seed Oklahoma Sooners, who had beaten Villanova by 23 on December 7, 2015, at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii early in the season. In the national semi-Finals, Villanova beat the Sooners by 44 points (an NCAA Final Four record) to advance to the NCAA Championship for the first time in 31 years.  They faced the second-overall #1 seed North Carolina Tar Heels for the championship.\nOn April 4, Villanova defeated UNC on a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer by Kris Jenkins to win the NCAA Championship by a final score of 77\u201374, winning their second NCAA championship.  UNC had recovered from a 10-point deficit in the final five minutes to tie the game on an off-balance, double-clutch three-point shot that passed through the net with 4.7 seconds left, leaving the Wildcats one last chance to clinch a victory before overtime. Kris Jenkins inbounded the ball to four-year team captain Ryan Arcidiacono, who dribbled down court, passed the ball and set a bubble screen to assist Jenkins' game-winning shot.  Coach Jay Wright credits the play to the \"Wildcat minute\", where the team practices late-game scenarios at every practice.  The game has been called one of the greatest in the history of NCAA tournament championships.\nVillanova ended the 2016 season at 35\u20135 including the unanimous #1 ranking in the final Coaches' Poll (USA Today) while capturing their 2nd NCAA basketball championship trophy in the history of the program. In beating #3 seed Miami (AP #10), #1 seed Kansas (AP #1), #2 seed Oklahoma (AP #7) and #1 seed UNC (AP #3), Villanova became the first school in 31 years \u2014 since the 1985 Villanova Wildcats \u2014 to not only beat four top-three seeds on the way to a national title but to also beat four straight opponents ranked in the AP top 10, in addition to beating AP-ranked Iowa in the Round of 32.  Villanova's run included two of the ten most offensively efficient games in the analytics era (2002\u2013present), beating Miami and Oklahoma by scoring 1.56 and 1.51 points per possession in the Sweet Sixteen and Final Four, respectively. It has been called perhaps the most dominant tournament championship run of all time, and the most dominant of the analytics era by a wide margin, with Villanova posting an average margin of victory equal to 20.7 points per game (+124 total point margin).\n\n2018 National Champions\nThe Wildcats finished second in regular season Big East play, won the Big East tournament, and were undefeated in non-conference play. They were awarded the top seed in the East Regional for the NCAA tournament. They reached the Final Four with wins over 16 seed Radford, 9 seed Alabama, 5 seed West Virginia and 3 seed Texas Tech with each victory coming by double-digit margins. In the national semifinals they faced the Kansas Jayhawks, the one seed from the Midwest Region, and defeated them 95\u201379. In this game Villanova set the new record for successful 3-point attempts in a Final Four game (breaking the previous full-game record before reaching halftime, finishing with 18 total made attempts). In the NCAA tournament championship Game they played the Michigan Wolverines, the 3 seed from the West Region. The Wildcats earned their third national championship in school history by beating the Wolverines 79\u201362. The game saw a historic performance by Big East Sixth Man of the Year Donte DiVincenzo (31 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks), named the 2018 Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. Coach Wright led the team to a 36\u20134 record for the 2017\u201318 season (14\u20134 Big East).  The 36\u20134 mark sets the record for most wins in any Villanova season. Jalen Brunson received the Wooden Award as well as Associated Press and Naismith National Player of the Year Awards for his season leading the Wildcats. Mikal Bridges was presented the Julius Erving Award as the nation's best small forward\u2014the second straight year a Villanova player achieved that honor after Josh Hart won it in 2017. Jay Wright was named winner of the John R. Wooden Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nAwards and honors\nPostseason\nNCAA Tournament history\nVillanova has appeared in 40 NCAA Tournaments, beginning with the first in 1939. The Wildcats have amassed a tournament record of 67\u201338 (.638), and were the national champions in 1985, 2016, and 2018. Their three titles are the 8th most of any program.  They have reached the Final Four five times, tied for fifteenth most. Villanova has won as the underdog (based on Tournament seeding) 16 times, more than any other program, and they are the highest seed (8) to ever win the NCAA tournament (1985). Villanova is one of only two programs (the other being Ohio State) that has played in the NCAA tournament in every decade since the 1930s.\n\nNCAA Tournament Seeding History\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nNIT history\nThe Wildcats have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 19 times.

Other rivals from the Big East Conference include founding members of the original Big East\u2014Providence (an eastern rivalry which predates the original Big East) and St. John's, plus Syracuse who left the Big East as part of its 2013 split for the ACC.\nSeton Hall has played Villanova more than any other school; due to the proximity of the schools and a series of memorable games since the formation of the new Big East, this has become one of Villanova's top rivalries each season. Games have included critical Seton Hall upsets in 2013, the 2014 Big East tournament, Villanova's first loss of 2015, and the 2016 Big East tournament championship as well as a Villanova blowout in a game that resulted in Seton Hall guard Sterling Gibbs punching Villanova guard Ryan Arcidiacono in 2015 and a narrow victory in the closing seconds of the 2017 Big East tournament semifinals.\n\nBig Five\nVillanova along with Saint Joseph's University, La Salle University, Temple University, and University of Pennsylvania banded together to create the Philadelphia Big 5 in 1954\u201355. From that date until the mid-1970s all Big 5 games were contested at the Palestra (cap. 9,208) on Penn's campus. The Five competed in a round-robin City Series. Additionally, all participated in numerous doubleheaders against non-Big 5 opponents. Most games were televised locally on WPHL-TV, broadcast by Harry Kalas.\nSince the beginning of the 1996\u20131997 season, Villanova has won 15 out of 21 Big 5 titles. They currently have 25 total Big 5 titles which is second most among the participating schools.\nVillanova's most bitter Big 5 rival is Saint Joseph's University, in what has become known as the Holy War.\n\nTraditions\nVillanova basketball athletes traditionally remain enrolled four years, graduate, and go on to enjoy post-college success. Villanova has never fired a head basketball coach (men's or women's). Villanova has won more NCAA tournament games as a lower seed than any school. Villanova won what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played, defeating Georgetown 66\u201364 on April 1, 1985, to win the NCAA national championship.\n\nSongs\nV for Villanova is the Wildcats' fight song.  Other Villanova songs include March of the Wildcats.\n\nStreamers\nVillanova had a tradition of throwing paper streamers in the school colors of blue and white onto the basketball court at home games, particularly Big Five games, after the first Wildcat basket.  This tradition was shared by other Big Five basketball teams, and at Big Five games, streamers were thrown by both teams following their team's first field goal.  The tradition was stopped in the late 1980s after the NCAA declared that throwing streamers would result in a technical foul. Since then Villanova has restarted the tradition, throwing the streamers on the first basket of the new season during the blue and white scrimmage game during Hoops Mania.\n\nHoops Mania\nHoops Mania has been an annual tradition to celebrate the start of basketball season. It was originally held in the Jake Nevin Fieldhouse for students and has since grown larger after the success of the 2005\u201306 season.  It is now held in the Pavilion and is open to the public and students. Following an inter-team scrimmage, notable music artists perform.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",
    "summary": "The Villanova Wildcats men's basketball program represent Villanova University in men's college basketball and competes in the Big East Conference of NCAA Division I. Their first season was the 1920\u201321 season. Named the Wildcats, Villanova is a member of the Philadelphia Big Five, five Philadelphia college basketball teams who share a passionate rivalry.\nThe Wildcats have won the national championship three times: 1985, 2016, and 2018. Their 1985 NCAA championship victory as an 8 seed still stands as the lowest seed ever to win the title. The championship game of that year is referred to as \"The Perfect Game\" as they shot a championship game record 78.6% as a team for the game (22 for 28, including 9 for 10 in the second half). Their 2016 NCAA Championship is referred to as \"The Perfect Ending\" and became the second of only two NCAA Men's Championship games to be won on a buzzer beater when Kris Jenkins drained a shot as time expired. They made the Final Four in 1939, 1971, 1985, 2009, 2016, 2018, and 2022; their six Final Four appearances are 13th most all-time. As of 2019, they have an NCAA Tournament record of 65\u201337 (.637). \nVillanova has defeated six No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament (Michigan and Georgetown in 1985, Pittsburgh in 2009, Kansas and North Carolina in 2016, and Kansas in 2018), which is sixth most all-time. The Villanova Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA tournament 39 times, the eighth highest total in NCAA history. They have won the Big East regular season championship eight times, most recently winning four straight from 2014 to 2017. They won the Big East tournament in 1995, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022. Through 2021, Villanova has 1,817 wins, which is 19th among Division I men's basketball teams and is tied for 9th in all time winning percentage at (.657). Villanova has won the Philadelphia Big Five 27 times, and is tied with Temple University for the most of any team, including five straight from 2014 to 2018. The Wildcats have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament 18 times, winning in 1994.",

    "biography": "The Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Virginia. The school competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Virginia won the NCAA Tournament Championship in 2019 and won the last ever NCAA Tournament third-place game in 1981. The Cavaliers have been ranked in the Top 5 of the AP Poll more than 100 times since 1980 and have earned seven No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament. The team plays home games at the on-campus John Paul Jones Arena (14,623) which opened in 2006. They have been the Cavaliers since 1923, predating the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA by half a century.\nVirginia was a top program in the early decades of college basketball under the tutelage of Pop Lannigan from 1905 to 1929 and a consistent winner under multi-sport coach Gus Tebell from 1930 to 1951, but the Cavaliers struggled through the 1950s and 1960s before Terry Holland arrived in 1974 to win their first ACC Championship and earn their first NCAA tournament appearance in just his second year. The program has since won 11 ACC season titles, third-most in conference history. Under Tony Bennett, Virginia had four out of five ACC teams to win 16 or more conference games in the 2010s and won its first NCAA Championship.\nMany Virginia players have been recognized for their NCAA and NBA successes, with Ralph Sampson and Malcolm Brogdon being named NBA Rookie of the Year. Brogdon is the NBA's eighth 50\u201340\u201390 club member and was the NBA Sixth Man of the Year for the Celtics in 2023. Sampson was a multi-time NBA All\u2013Star, the NBA All-Star Game MVP of 1985, and is now in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. At UVA he was the second (and ACC's only) three-time Naismith College Player of the Year. Trey Murphy III is the NCAA's eleventh and the ACC's only 50\u201340\u201390 club member. Brogdon and De'Andre Hunter were named NABC Defensive Player of the Year, Darion Atkins was awarded the Lefty Driesell Award, and Kyle Guy was named NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nSince 2014, Virginia has won one NCAA Tournament, two ACC Tournaments, and finished first (or tied for first) in conference standings six times\u2014more than any other ACC men's program.\n\nHistory\nThe Wahoos, as they are unofficially known, began their history under the tutelage of a Welshman and American immigrant known best as \"Pop\", Henry Lannigan. Lannigan began the program in 1905 after training Olympic Games hopefuls in track and field and quickly brought the basketball program into near-dominant form. He led the Cavaliers to a perfect record of 17\u20130 in 1914\u201315 and a Southern Conference title in its inaugural season of 1921\u201322. After reaching prominence the team was invited to help the nationally known Kentucky Wildcats showcase their new Alumni Gymnasium. Virginia dominated Kentucky, 29\u201316. Inviting Kentucky back to Memorial Gymnasium in 1928, Virginia again won, 31\u201328. Lannigan held the Virginia record for best career winning percentage by a head coach (254\u201395 (.728)) until he was surpassed by Tony Bennett, who was hired 104 years after the start of the program.\nAfter Lannigan's sudden death in 1930 and with limited administration interest at the onset of the Great Depression, Virginia basketball did not maintain its momentum into the next several decades. Buzzy Wilkinson scored 32.1 points per game in 1954\u201355 and is still the all-time ACC leader in scoring per game for both the single-season and career (28.1) categories. He was selected by the Boston Celtics in the 1955 NBA draft. Unfortunately, Virginia teams of the era were not as great at defense and high scoring did not lead to many wins. Likewise, Barry Parkhill was named ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 1971\u201372 and was drafted in the first round by the Portland Trail Blazers but the program had not regained its early standing.\n\nTerry Holland was hired from Davidson in 1975, and with star Wally Walker surprised the ACC in just his second year as head coach when his sixth-seeded Virginia defeated AP No. 17 NC State, No. 9 Maryland and No. 4 North Carolina en route to winning the school's first ACC Championship. Played in Landover, Maryland, it was also and fittingly the first ACC Tournament held outside of North Carolina. Athletic, quick, and seven-foot-four, Ralph Sampson was perhaps the most desired high school recruit in college basketball history when he chose to play with Jeff Lamp at Virginia over Kentucky in 1979. He lived up to that hype would become one of the most dominant college players the game has ever known, winning three consecutive Naismith College Player of the Year awards to tie him with Bill Walton as the most awarded individual player in NCAA history. Virginia would attain its first AP Top 5 rankings and go to its first Final Four in Sampson's era, but would be stonewalled by Dean Smith and North Carolina both in that Final Four and in ACC tournaments. Carolina notoriously held the ball in a four corners offense for most of the last seven minutes of the game, despite having UNC's most celebrated NBA superstars Michael Jordan and James Worthy on the floor, to defeat Virginia in the 1982 ACC tournament 47\u201345. Both the shot clock and three-point line were implemented into college basketball during the same decade in part to combat such shenanigans. In 1984, after Sampson was drafted first in the 1983 NBA draft, Virginia made a Cinderella run back to the Final Four. There they lost 49\u201347, in overtime, to a Houston team led by the first pick of the 1984 NBA draft, Hakeem Olajuwon, who then joined Sampson to form the original Twin Towers of the NBA on the Houston Rockets.\nJohn Crotty and Bryant Stith took the darkhorse 1988\u201389 team to the Elite Eight after defeating AP No. 2 (and No. 1 seed) Oklahoma which returned most of its lineup (including Stacey King and Mookie Blaylock) from the team that reached the 1988 NCAA Tournament Championship Game. After Holland retired the next year, the Cavaliers were coached by Jeff Jones for eight years, Pete Gillen for seven, and Dave Leitao for four. Highlights of those teams include a Jones team headlined by Cory Alexander and Junior Burrough that also reached the Elite Eight after a first-place finish in the ACC standings of 1995. There were no championship teams under Gillen, but his recruits Sean Singletary and J. R. Reynolds led the 2007 team to Virginia's next conference-topping finish in Leitao's second season.\nTony Bennett arrived in March 2009 and eventually restored UVA to (and beyond) its former prominence. His teams won UVA's second and third ACC Tournament championships, finished atop the ACC standings six times, and returned to the Final Four to win the 2019 NCAA Tournament championship. During his era, the 2014\u201315 squad, led by Justin Anderson and Malcolm Brogdon, was the most dominant: starting 19\u20130, doubling up the scores of Georgia Tech and Wake Forest and nearly tripling the score (76\u201327) of NCAA Tournament-bound Harvard. In doing so, the 2015 UVA team doubled the score of more ACC opponents than the entire rest of the ACC had in all their combined histories and was the first to do so (even once) in 60 years. However, Anderson broke his finger in the last game of the regular season against Louisville and did not return until the NCAA Tournament where he was much diminished and the team bowed out in the second round. After an Elite Eight appearance, Virginia then suffered a historic loss to a former UVA ballboy, Ryan Odom, and his 16-seed UMBC in the first round of the 2018 NCAA Tournament only to come back and win the 2019 NCAA Tournament for the program's first NCAA Championship the very next year. ESPN called Virginia's 2018\u201319 campaign \"the most redemptive season in the history of college basketball.\" CBS This Morning called it \"basketball's ultimate redemption story\" the morning after the national championship game. Kyle Guy was named the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player. De'Andre Hunter became a lottery pick after a convincing title game showdown with Jarrett Culver and was drafted fourth in the 2019 NBA draft. Virginia had four of the five ACC teams to win 16 or more games in the 2010s decade.\nIn March 2025, Ryan Odom, who guided UMBC to that victory over UVA seven years earlier, was handed the reins to the UVA program in March 2025 after Bennett's surprise retirement.\n\nNCAA Final Four teams\nVirginia is 3\u20132 at Final Four events and won the 2019 NCAA tournament championship.\n\n1981: Sampson and Goliath\nLed by Coach Terry Holland, National Player of the Year Ralph Sampson and his first team All-ACC teammate Jeff Lamp, the Cavaliers rolled to their best season in school history.  After beginning the season with a 23\u20130 record, the Cavaliers would claim the ACC Regular Season title before falling in the ACC Tournament Semi-finals.  Despite the loss, UVA still entered the NCAA tournament as the 1 seed in the East Regional of the 1981 NCAA tournament.\nUVA received a first-round bye and squeaked by Villanova 54\u201350 in the 2nd round.  They then handled both Tennessee and Brigham Young by 14 points each in the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 respectively to clinch a berth in the program's first ever Final Four in Philadelphia.  Although UVA swept North Carolina in the ACC regular season, the Tar Heels defeated the Cavaliers when it mattered most, in the national semi-finals.  Virginia closed the season on a high note, however, defeating Louisiana State in the national third-place game to cap the program's most successful season to that point.\n\n1984: Virginia plays Cinderella\nFollowing the loss of their vaunted All-American in Sampson, the Virginia basketball team took a step back in 1983\u201384, at least in the regular season.  The Cavaliers limped into the ACC tournament with a 17\u201310 (6\u20138) record, promptly falling to Wake Forest in the first round.  Their record was good enough to ensure them an NCAA tournament invite and they were awarded the 7-seed in the East Regional.\nAfter escaping 10th-seeded Iona 58\u201357 in the first round, Virginia drew 2nd-seeded Arkansas in the 2nd round.  The Cavaliers dispatched the Razorbacks 53\u201351 in an overtime affair before cruising past 3rd-seeded Syracuse 63\u201355 in the Sweet Sixteen.  In a low-scoring, defensive affair, the Cavaliers defeated Bobby Knight's 4th-seeded Indiana Hoosiers 50\u201348 in the Elite Eight to clinch the school's second Final Four appearance in 4 seasons.\nIn the National Semi-finals, Virginia drew the Hakeem Olajuwon-led Houston Cougars at the Kingdome in Seattle.  The Cavaliers gave the vaunted Phi Slama Jama lineup all they could handle, but eventually fell 49\u201347 in overtime, ending a surprisingly-successful postseason run.\n\n2019: Redemption National Championship\nComing off a loss to 16-seed UMBC a year prior, the Virginia team returned with a vaunted Bennett defense along with the three-pronged offensive attack of De'Andre Hunter, Kyle Guy, and Ty Jerome. The Cavaliers began and ended the season ranked in the AP Top 5, with a 28\u20132 regular season record and both losses to Zion Williamson's AP No. 1 ranked Duke squad under Coach Krzyzewski. Those two Virginia\u2013Duke matchups during the ACC regular season were the most watched college basketball games of the regular season with 3.8 million and 3.3 million viewers for their games in Durham and Charlottesville respectively.  In the ACC Tournament, Virginia defeated bubble team NC State 76\u201356 before being defeated by Florida State, 69\u201359. Entering the NCAA Tournament, Virginia was a No. 1 seed in the South region, Duke was the No. 1 overall seed and placed in the East region, while North Carolina also received a No. 1 seed but in the Midwest region. The only No. 1 seed from another conference was Gonzaga in the West, later to be defeated by Texas Tech in the Elite Eight.\nVirginia was the sole No. 1 seed of the tournament to advance to the Final Four after defeating Purdue. After first defeating Gardner-Webb, Oklahoma, and Oregon, they met the Boilermakers in the Elite Eight. Purdue's Carsen Edwards scored 42 points against Virginia, setting an individual scoring record against a Bennett-coached team. With Virginia down by three points with 5.9 seconds to play, Ty Jerome stepped to the line for two free throws, converting the first but missing the second. Mamadi Diakite back tapped the ball into the backcourt where Kihei Clark recovered it and passed back to Diakite with one second remaining in the game. Diakite immediately scored, and the game went into overtime. Virginia then outscored Purdue 10\u20135 in the extra period to advance. Jerome, Diakite, and Kyle Guy each made the South Regional All-Tournament team.\n\nIn the Final Four, Virginia met the Auburn Tigers who had already dispatched Kansas, North Carolina, and Kentucky to get there. This game was a back-and-forth battle as Virginia trailed the Tigers at halftime, 31\u201328. Virginia led by as many as 10 points in the second half before Auburn retook the lead late in the game. Down 61\u201357 with 7.7 seconds remaining, Guy scored a three-point shot from the right corner. Harper then converted one of two free throws to lead 62\u201360. Two controversial non-calls (one against Auburn, one against Virginia) by officials preceded Auburn being called for a foul with 1.5 seconds remaining. On the in-bounds play Jerome found Guy, again for the corner three, but Guy missed as an Auburn player fouled him by undercutting his lower body. Guy converted all three free throws to put Virginia into the 2019 NCAA Tournament Championship Game.\nThe National Championship match was headlined by two of the top defenses in college basketball, Virginia and the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Texas Tech did not score a field goal for the first 7 minutes and 11 seconds of the game, but eventually tied the game at 19 with 7 minutes and 33 seconds remaining in the first half. The teams traded leads until halftime, with Virginia holding a 32\u201329 advantage at intermission. Eventual top-10 picks in the subsequent NBA draft De'Andre Hunter and Jarrett Culver shot 1-for-8 and 0-for-6 from the field respectively in the first half, but Hunter shot 7-for-8 in the second half to end with a career-high 27 points while the NABC Defensive Player of the Year sophomore limited Culver to 5-for-22 shooting and a 15-point total. Texas Tech rallied from a deficit to take a late lead before Virginia scored in the closing seconds to take the game into overtime. Virginia outscored Texas Tech 17\u20139 in overtime to win their first national title 85\u201377.\nVirginia ended the season with a 35\u20133 record, breaking the school record for wins in a single-season. The team was 29\u20130 after leading at halftime. The Cavaliers were the first first-time champions of the NCAA Tournament since the University of Florida thirteen years earlier.  In light of the previous year's loss to UMBC, ESPN called Virginia's championship run \"the most redemptive season in the history of college basketball,\" and NBC Sports described it as \"the greatest redemption story in the history of sports.\"\n\nACC Tournament championship teams\nVirginia has won the ACC tournament three times, defeating Duke or North Carolina in each title game.\n\n1976: Miracle in Landover\nThe 1975\u201376 Cavalier season was largely disappointing as they finished 13\u201311 overall (4\u20138, ACC) and limped into the ACC tournament as the 6th seed.  Played at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, the tournament was the first in ACC history to be played outside the state of North Carolina.\nDespite falling to NC State twice during the regular season, the Cavaliers upset the 3rd-seeded Wolfpack 75\u201363.  The Cavaliers then drew 2-seed Maryland, longtime border rivals that had just defeated UVA five days earlier at Cole Fieldhouse.  Virginia defeated the AP No. 9 Terrapins, before dispatching top-seeded and AP No. 4 North Carolina 67\u201362 in the championship game.  It marked the first conference tournament title and NCAA appearance for Virginia, as well as only the 3rd time a non-North Carolina-based team won the conference title (following Maryland in 1958 and South Carolina in 1971).  Wally Walker scored 21 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in the title game, being named tournament MVP in the process.\nVirginia was awarded the East Region's 7 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they fell to 2nd-seeded DePaul in the first round.\n\n2014: Bennett Ball arrives\nAfter a few years of steady improvement, Tony Bennett finally had a team he had fully recruited and coached.  The Cavaliers got off to a forgettable 9\u20134 start, punctuated by a 35-point road loss at Tennessee.  Following a pivotal conversation between star G/F Joe Harris and Bennett, UVA got on track and rolled through the ACC.  On March 1, the 12th ranked Cavaliers would defeat No. 4 Syracuse at John Paul Jones Arena to clinch the ACC regular season title outright for the first time since 1981, allowing them to enter the 2014 ACC men's basketball tournament as the 1-seed.\nAfter cruising against 8th seeded Florida State, Virginia held off 4th-seeded Pittsburgh in the final seconds of the semi-final, setting up a championship game against 3rd seeded Duke at Greensboro Coliseum.   The Cavaliers would exact revenge for a regular season loss to the Blue Devils, defeating them 72\u201363 and claiming their first ACC tournament title in 38 years.  Joe Harris was named tournament MVP while Malcolm Brogdon joined him as a 1st team selection.  In the process, UVA defeated every ACC opponent at least once in a season for the first time since 1982.\n\n2018: Calm before the storm\nAfter losing all-conference point guard London Perrantes to graduation and the Cleveland Cavaliers, many expected 2017\u201318 to be a rebuilding year for Virginia basketball.  The team would start the season unranked before getting off to an 11\u20131 non-conference start and climbing up to No. 13 in the country at the start of conference play.  Virginia would then become the first team to go 17\u20131 in conference play, notably snapping a long losing streak at Cameron Indoor Stadium against Duke, scoring 5 points in 0.9 seconds to stun Louisville at the KFC Yum! Center, and only losing one conference game by a single point in overtime.\nThey would open the ACC tournament by routing 9th-seeded Louisville 75\u201358 in the quarterfinals before dispatching 4th-seeded Clemson 64\u201358 in the semis.  They would then rematch with a North Carolina team they had defeated earlier in Charlottesville and claim the ACC championship with a 71\u201363 win.  Kyle Guy was named tournament MVP and was joined on the First team by Devon Hall as the Cavaliers gave Tony Bennett his second ACC tournament title in 5 seasons.\n\nTournament championships\nNCAA national championships\nSeasons\nResults by season (1980\u2013present)\nPostseasons\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Cavaliers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times.

Their record is 2\u20131.\n\nRivalries\nAnnual Home-and-Away Series\nLouisville Cardinals\nFollowing conference realignment, the Cardinals moved from the Big East to the ACC and were designated UVA's home-and-away rivals. The two programs had previously had two consecutive home-and-away series in 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985, with the Cavaliers winning all four games. Justin Anderson's injury during the March 2015 matchup derailed No. 2 Virginia's national championship aspirations, while an improbable March 2018 Virginia victory\u2014scoring five points in the final 0.9 seconds at Louisville's KFC Yum! Center\u2014ended the Cardinals' NCAA tournament hopes. Both rivals have won recent NCAA Championships\u2014Louisville in 2013 (vacated) and Virginia in 2019. UVA leads the all-time series 23\u20137 as of 2025.\n\nVirginia Tech Hokies\nAs the Commonwealth's two power conference teams, the Cavaliers and Hokies have a long-standing rivalry. When the teams were in separate conferences this rivalry often played out on neutral courts across the Commonwealth, such as in Richmond, Roanoke, and Hampton. The all-time series record is well in favor of UVA, with the Cavaliers leading the series 99\u201361 as of 2025, but the rivalry is extremely competitive and Tech dominated the decade of the 1960s.\n\nOther rivalries\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels\nAs the two oldest universities of the ACC, the UVA\u2013UNC rivalry spans many sports and has persisted to varying degrees since the late 1800s. The early 1980s were a particular highlight for the basketball series as all-time greats Ralph Sampson and Michael Jordan led two Top 5 programs of the era. The two teams defeated each other for ACC Tournament Championships in 2016 and 2018, and the winner of those conference title matches went on to win NCAA Championships the following year (North Carolina in 2017, Virginia in 2019).\n\nMaryland Terrapins\nThanks to the proximity of these two long-time ACC members, and their status as Tobacco Road outsiders, Maryland and Virginia have a long-standing rivalry that spans many decades.  Traditionally, these two schools would meet in the last game of the season, and acted as spoilers to each other as they sought ACC season championships and NCAA Tournament appearances.  This rivalry has been diminished since Maryland's move to the Big Ten Conference in 2014. They did match up twice in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, both played at Maryland's Xfinity Center, with both games won by Virginia.\n\nCoaches\nVirginia has had 11 permanent (and 2 interim) head coaches lead the Cavaliers.

    "summary": "The Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Virginia. The school competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Virginia won the NCAA Tournament Championship in 2019 and won the last ever NCAA Tournament third-place game in 1981. The Cavaliers have been ranked in the Top 5 of the AP Poll more than 100 times since 1980 and have earned seven No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament. The team plays home games at the on-campus John Paul Jones Arena (14,623) which opened in 2006. They have been the Cavaliers since 1923, predating the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA by half a century.\nVirginia was a top program in the early decades of college basketball under the tutelage of Pop Lannigan from 1905 to 1929 and a consistent winner under multi-sport coach Gus Tebell from 1930 to 1951, but the Cavaliers struggled through the 1950s and 1960s before Terry Holland arrived in 1974 to win their first ACC Championship and earn their first NCAA tournament appearance in just his second year. The program has since won 11 ACC season titles, third-most in conference history. Under Tony Bennett, Virginia had four out of five ACC teams to win 16 or more conference games in the 2010s and won its first NCAA Championship.\nMany Virginia players have been recognized for their NCAA and NBA successes, with Ralph Sampson and Malcolm Brogdon being named NBA Rookie of the Year. Brogdon is the NBA's eighth 50\u201340\u201390 club member and was the NBA Sixth Man of the Year for the Celtics in 2023. Sampson was a multi-time NBA All\u2013Star, the NBA All-Star Game MVP of 1985, and is now in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. At UVA he was the second (and ACC's only) three-time Naismith College Player of the Year. Trey Murphy III is the NCAA's eleventh and the ACC's only 50\u201340\u201390 club member. Brogdon and De'Andre Hunter were named NABC Defensive Player of the Year, Darion Atkins was awarded the Lefty Driesell Award, and Kyle Guy was named NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nSince 2014, Virginia has won one NCAA Tournament, two ACC Tournaments, and finished first (or tied for first) in conference standings six times\u2014more than any other ACC men's program.",

    "biography": "The Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Home games are played at Cassell Coliseum, located on Virginia Tech's campus in Blacksburg, Virginia.\nThe Hokies have made the NCAA tournament 13 times, the most recent appearance coming in 2022. They have reached the Sweet Sixteen twice, in 1967 and 2019. They advanced to the Elite Eight once, in 1967.\nThe Hokies won the ACC Tournament title in 2022, the Metro Conference tournament title in 1979, the Southern Conference regular season championship in 1959\u201360, and two National Invitation Tournament titles in 1973 and 1995.\n\nHistory\nEarly years, Southern Conference, Independent\nThe Hokies' first intercollegiate basketball game was played January 22, 1909, resulting in a 33\u201326 win over Emory & Henry College. During the 1909\u201310 campaign, the Hokies completed the only undefeated season in school history by posting an 11\u20130 mark.\n\nFrom 1921 to 1965, Virginia Tech was a member of the Southern Conference. In 45 years, Tech won one regular season conference championship.  That was in 1960, when under coach Coach Chuck Noe the Hokies hit the 20-win mark for the first time.  That team lost to West Virginia, led by Jerry West, in the conference tournament championship game, and therefore was not eligible to advance to the NCAA tournament.\nTech left the Southern Conference in 1965, and in its first season as an independent went to the NIT for the first time in school history, posting an overall mark of 19\u20135 after losing to Temple in the first round. It was coach Howie Shannon second year at the school. The next year, in the 1966\u201367 season, Tech earned its first trip to  NCAA tournament.  That year, Tech won two games in the tournament that included only 23 teams, making it to what is now called the Elite Eight. The team finished with a 20\u20135 record. Shannon coached at Tech for seven seasons, and posted 104 wins, with only one losing season.\nIn 1971, Tech hired  29-year old Ohio State assistant coach Don DeVoe. In 1973, Tech made its second appearance in the NIT, and stunned the country, winning four games in Madison Square Garden by a total of five points, including a heart-wrenching 92\u201391 overtime win over Notre Dame. At the time, the NCAA only invited 32 teams, and only winners of conference tournaments were eligible. Tech earned an independent berth in the 1975-76 NCAA tournament in a field of 32. DeVoe and Tech parted ways following that season when he refused to sign a new contract after openly admitted that he was a candidate for the vacant head coaching job at Ohio State, his alma mater.\n\nThe Metro Conference Era\nIn 1978, one year after former Tech assistant Charlie Moir took the reins from DeVoe, Virginia Tech joined the Metro 7, a conference that did not have a football championship. Tech's first year in the Metro led to its first conference championship. Even though it did not compete in a round-robin regular season schedule, it was able to beat regular season champion Louisville in the semi-finals and Florida State in the tournament championship game to earn its third trip to the NCAA tournament, where it lost to NCAA runner-up Indiana State led by star Larry Bird.\nTech finished second, or tied for second, in the conference three times in the next seven years, and won 20 games in seven of its first eight seasons in the Metro. Moir guided Tech to 213 wins in 11 seasons from 1976 to 1987. The Hokies appeared in four NCAA Tournaments and went to the NIT four times in Moir's tenure as coach. Fortunes changed for the Hokies in 1986\u201387 when the team had its first losing season since 1969\u201370. Moir and Tech reached an agreement to part ways following an NCAA investigation that left the team on probation through October, 1989. Tech paid Moir $250,000 to buy out his contract.\nTech hired Moir's assistant Frankie Allen as interim head coach to lead the program in the 1987\u20131988 season while it searched for an athletic director to replace Bill Dooley. Allen was Moir's first recruit at Roanoke College, and that institution's first African American athlete. He had been on the Tech staff for 11 years. When Dave Braine was hired as athletic director, he gave Allen the job as head coach.  Allen led the Hokies to a 19\u201310 record and a third place tie in the Metro conference in that year that he began as interim coach. However, he did not have another winning season in his next three years, and his contract was not renewed.\nBill Foster, former coach of Clemson and Miami took over as head coach in 1991.  After two straight 10\u201318 seasons, the Hokies broke a five-year losing streak with an 18\u201310 record and a fourth-place finish in the Metro Conference in the '93\u2013'94 season. The following year, the Hokies earned their first postseason berth since 1986, and capitalized by winning their second NIT title.  The team set the school record at the time with 25 wins, including five wins in the NIT. It was their last season in the Metro Conference.\n\nA decade of conference and coaching changes\nIn 1991, the Big East, previously a basketball-only conference, decided to begin play as a football conference. Miami, which had just restarted its basketball program in 1985 and played as an independent, was accepted as an \"all-sports\" member.  Rutgers, Temple, West Virginia and Virginia Tech were added as \"football only\" members. Tech sought full Big East membership, including for basketball, and in March 1994, the league voted on expansion. Tech was left out of the mix as West Virginia and Rutgers got the nod.  Tech was left seeking to join its fellow Metro members in an attempt to create another large conference. However, it was also left out of that mix, along with Metro member Virginia Commonwealth. The two schools sued the 12 members of the new conference, but in the end Tech had to settle for its third choice for a basketball league, the  Atlantic 10.\nFoster and the Hokies took the A-10 by storm in its first year in the league, finishing tied for first in the East division of the 12-team league. It went to the NCAA tournament and won its first game before bowing out to eventual national champion Kentucky. After the following season, Foster retired,  and was replaced by Bobby Hussey, one of Foster's assistants. Hussey was fired after two losing seasons. The Hokies then turned to a former nemesis as its next head coach, tapping former UVA star Ricky Stokes for the head job.  In Stokes' first season, Tech's last season in the A-10, Tech eked out a 16\u201315 record.\nIn November 1999, Tech finally was rewarded with an invitation to full membership in the Big East Conference.  However, the Hokies were overmatched their first three years in the league, winning a total of 10 games in three years, finishing last of seven teams in the East division each of those years, and never reaching the conference tournament where only the top six teams of the division made the tournament. Stokes was fired at the end of the 2003 season. Stokes was dismissed after three straight losing season in the Big East, and Tech brought in coach Seth Greenberg to right the ship.\n\nJoining the Atlantic Coast Conference\nOn June 25, 2003, Virginia Tech received news it had waited anxiously to receive for a half a century - an invitation to join the ACC. In 1953, the Atlantic Coast Conference was formed by seven teams who were then members of the Southern Conference (Clemson, Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina, and Wake Forest.  Conference officials expressed interest in adding an eighth member, and candidates mentioned were Virginia and West Virginia. \nOn December 4, 1953, officials convened in Greensboro, North Carolina, and admitted Virginia, a former Southern Conference charter member that had been independent since 1937, into the conference.  News reports said that not only was West Virginia turned down, but so was Virginia Tech.\nTech fans spent much of the next 25 years watching ACC basketball on Saturday afternoons and Wednesday evenings before their hopes were raised again in 1977, five years after South Carolina left the league with only seven members. On May 2, 1977, after making a required site visit to Blacksburg to evaluate Tech's formal application, the ACC took its first vote on expansion since Virginia was admitted in 1953. Tech did not receive the requisite five votes of the seven league teams. A year later, Georgia Tech was tapped to be the league's eighth member, expanding its footprint into the lucrative Atlanta television market.\nAnother ACC/Tech flirtation occurred in 1999 when the Big East sought to bring Miami into the conference mix. Miami ultimately decided to stay in the Big East, and the Hokies were subsequently admitted as a full members of the Big East.\nJust three years after Tech joined the Big East as full members, the ACC and Big East began a standoff that ultimately entered the courts, and governor's mansions. On May 16, 2003, the ACC voted 8\u20131 to enter into formal discussions with Miami, Syracuse, and Boston College, leaving Virginia Tech out of the mix. \nOn June 6, 2003, Big East members Tech, Rutgers, Connecticut, Pittsburgh, and West Virginia, entered into a suit against the ACC and two of the three proposed defectors - Miami and Boston College. (Syracuse was not named as a defendant because the plaintiffs found no examples of promises by Syracuse on which they made financial decisions). \nThe lawsuit charged that the defendants conspired \"on a scheme that is calculated to destroy the Big East and misappropriate its value for their benefit.\"\nBy June 18, 2003, it became clear that the original expansion plan would not receive the required seven votes of the nine voting schools - meaning at least three schools were holding out. University of Virginia President John Casteen had been a strong advocate of the Hokies and was vocally one of the hold-outs, likely the original \"no\" vote on May 16 when the Hokies were excluded. Virginia governor Mark Warner reportedly pressured the University of Virginia Board of Visitors (who serve as the supervisor of the university president and are appointed by the governor) to allow Casteen to continue his strong advocacy of the Hokies. Another \"no\" vote was likely Georgia Tech, whose president was Wayne Clough, a man who been on the faculty of Virginia Tech between 1982 and 1994, including as Dean of Engineering starting in 1990.\nClough was the individual who visited with Virginia Tech president Charles Steger to officially deliver the news of the ACC change of heart on June 18. (Clough maintained his home in Blacksburg after he left the university). The third ACC university that was likely supportive of the Hokies to the point of vetoing a bid to Miami, Boston College, and Syracuse was Wake Forest University The school is geographically closest to Blacksburg (in Winston-Salem, NC), but as a small private school had little in common with Tech. However, several academic relationships were forged after the 1999 Tech/ACC negotiations. When Tech finally got the seven necessary votes for invitation, the biggest surprise was that Syracuse and Boston College were left out of the mix. Boston College was invited to the ACC just months later, on October 12, 2003. Syracuse wasn't invited to join the conference until 2011.  (It joined along with Pittsburgh, which had been one of the co-plaintiffs in Tech's suit against the ACC. West Virginia left the Big East for the Big 12 that same year. Another co-plaintiff, Rutgers went to the Big 10 in 2014. The fifth co-plaintiff, Connecticut, stayed with the Big East until its football members became the American Athletic Conference in 2013).\n\nMoving past the conference wars\nBefore the conference controversies were settled, Tech had hired a new head coach to replace Stokes. Seth Greenberg, who was head coach at South Florida, was hired prior to the 2003\u201304 season. Tech had its first winning record since 1999\u20132000 under Greenberg, going 15\u201314 and advancing to its first Big East basketball tournament in Madison Square Garden. The Big East had expanded its tournament to include all teams for the first time, but since Tech finished eight in the conference with a 7\u20139 record, it would have made the tournament under the old format.\nTech's first season in the ACC resulted in an 8\u20138 conference record, good enough for a fourth seed and first-round bye in the 11-team conference tournament.  Greenburg was named ACC Coach of the Year, and the Hokies advanced to their first post-season tournament since 1995.  Tech beat Temple at home in the first round of the NIT, before falling to former Metro rival Memphis.\n\nAfter a down year in 2005\u201306, Tech surged for the next five years. During the 2006\u201307 season, Virginia Tech beat Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium and also beat top-ranked North Carolina in Blacksburg. The Hokies went on to beat fourth-ranked North Carolina in Chapel Hill that same season. The Hokies earned a bid to the NCAA tournament that season as a No. 5 seed and beat Illinois before losing to Southern Illinois.  It ended the year with a 22\u201310 record, the first time Tech had crossed the 20-win mark since the 1995\u20131996 season, when it also went to the NCAA tournament.\nIn January 2009, Virginia Tech beat No. 1-ranked Wake Forest, the last unbeaten team in Division I in the 2008\u201309 season, marking the Hokies fourth defeat of a top-ranked team.  The Hokies finished the 2009\u201310 season with a record of 23\u20138 and were snubbed for the NCAA tournament partially because they had one of the worst nonconference schedule strengths in recent memory. They received a bid to the NIT where they advanced to the third round before losing to Rhode Island. The following year Virginia Tech added another victory over a top-ranked team on February 26, 2011, when it beat No. 1 Duke, 64\u201360 in Cassell Coliseum. But, they again received a bid to the NIT, just missing out on the NCAA tournament.\nAfter a disappointing 2011\u201312 season and after nine seasons with a record of 170\u2013123 at Virginia Tech, Greenberg was fired. James Johnson replaced him shortly thereafter. Greenberg has the second most wins all-time at Virginia Tech behind Moir.\nThe Hokies beat 15th-ranked Oklahoma State on December 1, 2012. Star Erick Green led the team to its first non-conference home defeat of a ranked opponent since 1995 by scoring 28 points. After two seasons with a record of 22\u201341, Johnson was fired.\n\nBuzz Williams takes Hokies to three straight NCAA tournaments and a Sweet 16\nVirginia Tech hired Marquette head coach Buzz Williams as head basketball coach on March 24, 2014. Though the 2014\u201315 season was difficult, the 2015\u201316 team finished with a 20\u201315 record and advanced to the second round of the NIT. Finally, in 2016\u201317, the Hokies broke through and earned a trip to the NCAA tournament as a No. 9 seed, falling to Wisconsin in the first round.\nThe 2018\u201319 season saw the Hokies defeat Duke for the third consecutive time in Blacksburg. The ended the season at 24\u20138 (12\u20136 ACC), receiving the 5th seed in the Conference tournament giving them a first-round bye. They played Miami for the second time in a week in the second round, winning the game, setting up a rematch with Florida State in the quarter finals. Florida State won 65\u201363 in overtime. They received a bid to the NCAA Tournament as the 4th seed in the East Region. Wins over 13th seeded St. Louis and 12th seeded Liberty set a rematch with Duke in the Sweet 16.  The Hokies fell to the Blue Devils, 75\u201373, finishing the season at 26\u20139.\nWilliams was announced as the new head basketball coach at Texas A&M on April 3, 2019. Texas A&M was required to pay Virginia Tech $750,000 in lieu of Williams completing his contract with the Hokies.\n\nMike Young guides Tech to ACC Tournament firsts\nOn April 7, 2019, Virginia Tech announced the hiring of former Wofford coach Mike Young to lead the program. In his second season as head coach, Mike Young guided the Hokies to their first ever double-bye in the ACC Men's Basketball Tournament and a fourth consecutive berth in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. (In his first season, the 2020 tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.)\nOn March 12, 2022, Young coached the Hokies to the ACC tournament championship for the first time in school history. Tech won 82\u201367 over regular season champion Duke. The game was Mike Krzyzewski's final ACC tournament game, and his 22nd time in the championship game. It was Tech's first time in the championship. To get to the final night, they had to go into overtime to beat Clemson, then bested second seed Notre Dame, and third-seeded North Carolina.  The Hokies became the lowest seeded team in history to win the tournament.  By winning the ACC tournament, Tech earned its fifth straight berth in the NCAA tournament.  It was only the second conference tourney championship for the Hokies, which won the Metro Conference tournament in 1979.\n\nRetired numbers\nVirginia Tech has retired four jersey numbers.\n\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Hokies have appeared in 13 NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 8\u201313.\n\nNIT results\nThe Hokies have appeared in 15 National Invitation Tournaments. Their combined record is 26\u201313. They were NIT champions in 1973 and 1995.\n\nRivalries\nVirginia Cavaliers\nAs the Commonwealth's two power conference teams, the Hokies and Cavaliers have a long-standing rivalry. When the teams were in separate conferences this rivalry often played out on neutral courts across the Commonwealth, such as in Richmond, Roanoke, and Hampton. UVA leads the series 99\u201361 as of 2025, but the rivalry is extremely competitive and the Hokies dominated the decade of the 1960s.\n\nStatistics\nStatistics updated as of 2020\u201321 season\n\nAll-time leaders\nBlocks\nCurrent coaching staff\nMike Young \u2013 Head Coach\nChristian Webster \u2013 Assistant Coach\nKevin Giltner   \u2013 Assistant Coach\nMatt Olinger   \u2013 Special Assistant for Recruiting\nAce Custis \u2013 Special Assistant to Head Coach\nRyan Nadeau   \u2013 Video Coordinator\nDavid Jackson   \u2013 Strength and Conditioning\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

  "Washington Huskies": {
    "biography": "The Washington Huskies men's basketball team represents the University of Washington in NCAA Division I college basketball competing in the Big Ten Conference. Their home games are played at Hec Edmundson Pavilion, located in Seattle, and they are currently led by head coach Danny Sprinkle.\n\nHec Edmundson Pavilion\nHec Edmundson Pavilion is the home for the Huskies men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball team and gymnastics squad. The 2020\u201321 season marks the 94th season of service for the multi-purpose facility. The facility was originally completed in December 1927. Wilson James Commissioning renovated the interior of Hec Edmundson Pavilion for $40 million. The renovation lasted 19 months between March 1999 and November 2000. The pavilion's name was also changed; originally slated to be \"Seafirst Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion\" when the deal was finalized in 1998, it became \"Bank of America Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion\" at the reopening, as Bank of America had retired the Seafirst brand in 1999. The ten-year sponsorship with the bank expired after the 2009\u201310 season and was not renewed; during the first half of the 2010\u201311 basketball season the venue was sponsorless and once again known simply as \"Hec Edmundson Pavilion\".

  "Washington State Cougars": {
    "biography": "The Washington State Cougars men's basketball team represents Washington State University and competes in the West Coast Conference (WCC) of NCAA Division I. The Cougars play their home games on campus in Pullman at Beasley Coliseum, which has a capacity of 12,058. They are currently led by head coach David Riley. Washington State has appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament seven times, most recently in 2024.\n\nHistory\nWashington State began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1902. The Cougars were retroactively awarded the 1917 National Championship by the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1957 and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll in 1995. The team played to large crowds in the late-1970s when George Raveling was head coach.\nFor the better part of seven decades, the Cougars were a consistent contender in the Pac-10 and its predecessor, the Pacific Coast Conference. After a dark period in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was the beginning of a resurgence under coach Dick Bennett. The 2004\u201305 season saw a large increase in student support as the team finished within a few wins of a .500 record (along with a stunning upset win against Arizona, an eventual Elite Eight team). Bennett retired at the end of the 2005\u201306 season and was replaced by his son, Tony.\nTony Bennett tied the all-time WSU record for wins (26) twice in three seasons as head coach before leaving to coach the Virginia Cavaliers in 2009. Washington State had recently cancelled a trip to the 2009 Final Four for Bennett and his staff, and was considering dropping chartered recruiting trips which had been started one year prior at Bennett's request.\n\n2006\u201307\nThe Cougars earned a #3 seed in the NCAA tournament and beat Oral Roberts 70\u201354 in the first round. The Cougars then lost to Vanderbilt in the second round 78\u201374 in double overtime. Their final record was 13\u20135 in the Pac-10 and 26\u20138 overall, which tied the school record for most wins in a season. During the 2006\u201307 season, the Cougars swept rival Washington, Arizona, Arizona State, USC, Oregon State, and California. In the tournament, the coaching staff wore a pin saying TAY, which stood for Turn-Around Year. After the season, Coach Tony Bennett received the Naismith Coach of the Year award, the highest honor for a college basketball coach.\n\n2007\u201308\nIn 2008, the Cougars returned to the NCAA tournament. The Cougars earned a #4 seed and were matched up against #13 seed Winthrop University. The Cougars dominated in the second half after a 29\u201329 tie in the first half to finish 71\u201340, far beyond the 9 point margin they were favored by.\nAfter two straight victories in the NCAA Tournament, the Cougars headed to the Sweet Sixteen for the second time in school history. In the Sweet Sixteen, Washington State was matched against the #1 overall seed North Carolina. During the first half, both teams seem evenly matched, but North Carolina took control in the second half and won by a score of 68\u201347. The Cougars finished the 2007\u201308 season with a record of 26\u20139.\n\nSince 2019\nOn March 27, 2019, Smith was named as the 19th head coach of Washington State, agreeing to a six-year contract worth $1.4 million annually. He was formally introduced at a press conference on April 1, 2019. In his first season at Washington State, Smith led the Cougars to a 6\u201312 conference record (16-16 overall), their best since 2011\u201312. In the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament, Washington State beat Colorado, their first win in the conference tournament in over 10 years. In September 2021, Smith signed a contract extension through the 2026-27 season.\nDuring the 2021-22 season, Smith led the Cougars to their first winning record in conference play (11-9) in 14 years (2007-08). The Cougars followed up their regular season success with a win in the Pac-12 Tournament before losing to eventual runner-up UCLA. Following that, an NIT berth as a No. 4 seed gave the Cougs their first postseason bout in 11 years. Their first round win against Santa Clara (63-50) notched their first 20-win season since 2010-11. The 2021\u201322 season ended after an impressive run that landed the Cougs in the Semifinals of the NIT (for the second time in program history) against Texas A&M, where their final record on the season was 22-15.\nOn February 19, 2024, the Cougars returned to the AP Poll for the first time since the 2007\u201308 season (#21 with a 20\u20136 record). The following week, Washington State completed a season sweep of the 4th ranked team in the country, Arizona, to move into 1st place in the PAC-12 and all but ensure their first March Madness appearance in 16 years.\nOn March 17, 2024, Washington State was given an at-large bid by the selection committee, officially ending their 16-year long NCAA Tournament drought. The Cougars received a 7-seed and a first-round matchup against the Drake Bulldogs.\n\nHead coaches\nGeorge Raveling* was the first African American head coach in the Pacific Athletic Conference (known as the PAC 8 at the time). He coached from 1972\u20131983 and won 167 games at WSU.\nHead coach Tony Bennett announced that he was leaving for Virginia following the 2008\u201309 season. Bennett, who became head coach after his father Dick Bennett's retirement, finished the season with a 17\u201316 record. In the previous two years, he led the Cougars to consecutive NCAA tournament appearances; father and son coached the Cougars for three seasons each.\nKen Bone replaced Bennett as head coach of the WSU Cougars Men's Basketball Team in February 2009. Bone served as head coach until 2014 and he was followed as head coach by Ernie Kent.\nKent served as head coach until 2019. He was replaced by Kyle Smith, who served in the role until 2024. He was replaced by current head coach, David Riley.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Cougars have appeared in seven NCAA Tournaments, with an overall record of 7\u20137.\n\nNIT results\nThe Cougars have appeared in seven National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), with a combined record of 10\u20137.\n\nCBI results\nThe Cougars have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational (CBI).

As of the 2013\u201314 season, Washington State has a 98\u201350 (.662) lead in the series against the Bulldogs; the series began in 1907 and has most recently been played annually since 2001. The game in December 2007 marked the first time the two met as ranked teams. Visiting Washington State was ranked #6 in the AP Poll and won 51\u201347 over #19 Gonzaga at the McCarthey Athletic Center.\n\nIdaho\nA non-conference series since 1959, Washington State has played the Idaho Vandals of neighboring Moscow  annually since 1906 in a rivalry dubbed the Battle of the Palouse; the U of I is less than eight miles (13 km) east of Pullman. They often met four or five times per season until 1964, reduced to twice a season for the next decade. It has since become an annual event early in the schedule (except for the mid-1990s, when two games per season were played). The continuing rivalry is the oldest in the western United States, four years older than WSU's series with the Washington Huskies.\nThe two played the first-ever regular season basketball game in the newly-enclosed Kibbie Dome in January 1976, won by the Cougars. The rivalry was at its peak in December 1982 when 11,000 were in the same venue for a Saturday night overtime thriller, won by the Vandals.\nWashington State has a 167\u2013110 (.603) lead in the series through November 2021, when Washington State won 109\u201361 in Moscow, for a fourth straight win.\n\nWashington\nThe University of Washington is located in Seattle, nearly 300 miles (480 km) west of Pullman.

    "biography": "The West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball team represents West Virginia University in NCAA Division I college basketball competition. They are a member of the Big 12 Conference. WVU has won 13 conference tournament championships, and has 31 appearances in the NCAA tournament, including two Final Fours, most recently in 2010. The Mountaineers have also appeared in 16 National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), and have won the tournament twice, in 1942 and 2007. The 1942 NIT Championship is claimed by West Virginia as a National Championship.\nWVU plays their home games at the Hope Coliseum, their home venue since 1970.\n\nHistory\nWest Virginia men's basketball has competed in three basketball championship final matches: the 1959 NCAA tournament final, the 1942 NIT final (at that time, the NIT was considered more prestigious than the NCAA), and the 2007 NIT championship. They lost 71\u201370 to California in the 1959 NCAA finals, while the Mountaineers won the 1942 NIT championship 47\u201345 over Western Kentucky, and the 2007 National Invitation Tournament contest over Clemson 78\u201372 in a rebuilding season. In 1949, future Mountaineers head coach Fred Schaus became the first player in NCAA history to record 1,000 points.\nThe most points scored in a game was 132 points against Alaska-Fairbanks in 1994, while the largest margin of victory was against Salem College, with the Mountaineers winning 113\u201332 in 1945. The largest margin of defeat in Mountaineer basketball history came in 1978 against Louisville, when the Cardinals beat the Mountaineers 106\u201360.\n\n1955\u20131965 era\nRod Hundley\nThe modern era of West Virginia basketball history began in 1955, with the emergence of sophomore guard Hot Rod Hundley and newly appointed head coach Fred Schaus. The Mountaineers finished with a 19\u201311 record, and earned the first NCAA tournament appearance in school history under Hundley's lead. The team entered the tournament with a #19 ranking, the first Top 20 ranking in school history. However, they lost to the #3 La Salle Explorers in the first round of the tourney, 95\u201361.\nThe following season, 1956, the Mountaineers posted a 21\u20139 record in Hundley's junior season, which was his best statistically. The team began the season with a #14 ranking, however lost consecutively to #13 George Washington University and #2 North Carolina State, dropping them out of the rankings. They eventually worked their way back to a #19 ranking, before losing to Villanova, La Salle, and Carnegie Tech to drop out of the rankings again. The squad never entered the rankings again on the season until the NCAA tournament, when they reached the #14 ranking. However, they once again lost in the first round to Dartmouth College, 61\u201359 in overtime.\nIn Hundley's senior season, 1957, the team opened with eight straight victories, including an 83\u201382 upset over the Duke Blue Devils. The team also reached the #13 ranking before the Duke victory, and then rose to the #8 ranking in the final two victories. It marked the first time a Mountaineer squad was ranked in the Top 10 nationally. Going into the Dixie Classic, the Mountaineers achieved a #4 ranking (the first Top 5 ranking in school history), but lost three straight games in the tourney. The team posted 11 consecutive wins afterwards, rising from a #19 ranking to a #10 ranking. They dropped to #14 after a loss to Penn State, but won the next six games, including the Southern Conference Championship. The #7 Mountaineers were dropped in the first round of the NCAA tournament again however, to the #20 Canisius team, 64\u201356.\n\nJerry West\nAfter Hot Rod Hundley's graduation and departure to the NBA, sophomore guard Jerry West emerged for the Mountaineers and Fred Schaus. In his rookie collegiate season, West helped the Mountaineers to a 26\u20132 record, with a 12\u20130 conference record. The Mountaineers began the season with a #8 ranking, as they earned defeats over Penn State, #19 Richmond, and a 77\u201370 victory over #5 Kentucky in the Kentucky Invitational Tournament. The following game, the Mountaineers upset the #1-ranked nationally North Carolina, 75\u201365, to win the Kentucky Tourney. After the UNC victory, the Mountaineers rose to the first-ever #1 ranking in school history. In the two wins in the tourney, West totaled 29 points and 19 rebounds. Over the next six-game winning streak, the Mountaineers produced wins over Canisius, Villanova, Pittsburgh, and Furman. However, the Mountaineers were finally toppled by the Duke Blue Devils in Durham, 72\u201368. The squad retained their #1 ranking however, as they produced victories over Florida State, St. John's, VMI, Penn State, and Pittsburgh. In the final regular-season game, against George Washington, the team went into double overtime to pull out a 113\u2013107 victory, with West earning 25 points and 9 rebounds. The squad swept the Southern Conference tournament, with their closest victory an 11-point win over Richmond in the semi-finals. However, the one-loss squad lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament for the fourth consecutive season, this loss coming to Manhattan, 84\u201389.\n\nThe following season, West's junior season at West Virginia, the squad posted a 29\u20135 record with another undefeated conference record, 11\u20130. The squad's highest ranking of the season was at a #4 ranking after a Penn State victory in the third game of the season. However, they lost shortly afterwards to Virginia to drop to #7. The Mountaineers posted two more wins, but lost in the Kentucky Invitational Tournament to #2 Kentucky, 91\u201397. They rose to #5 after the loss, but then lost the following game to #12 Northwestern in double overtime, 109\u2013118. The Mountaineers bounced back however, with a victory over the #11-ranked Tennessee Volunteers. The team dropped to #11 in the rankings, but posted ten straight victories afterwards. The streak included an overtime victory over Penn State and a Backyard Brawl victory over Pittsburgh as the Mountaineers were ranked #10. As soon as the team rose to #9, they lost in overtime to NYU, but posted two straight wins following. The team ended the season with wins over Pittsburgh and George Washington. They swept the Southern Conference tournament for a third straight season. For the first time in Fred Schaus' coaching career at WVU, the Mountaineers advanced further than the opening round of the NCAA tournament. The team eventually won the East Region with victories over #14 St. Joseph's in the semi-finals and Boston University in the finals. In the two games, West scored 69 points in leading the Mountaineers into the Final Four, the furthest ventured in school history. The Mountaineers won their semifinal matchup against the Louisville Cardinals, 94\u201379; with West scoring 38 points and grabbing 15 rebounds. However, in the championship game, the Mountaineers were bested by California, 70\u201371. Jerry West was named the tournament MVP, having scored 28 points and gathering 11 rebounds in the championship loss.\nIn the 1960 season following their NCAA tournament championship loss, West led the Mountaineers to a 26\u20135 record as a senior. The team posted eight straight wins before being ranked, including victories over Tennessee, Richmond, and Kentucky to win the Kentucky Invitational Tournament. Upon being ranked #2 in the nation, the Mountaineers won over the Stanford Cardinal and UCLA Bruins in the Los Angeles Classic, before losing to #3 California in the Championship game. The squad dropped to #3, but posted six straight victories afterwards. The victories included Penn State, Virginia, and Pittsburgh. They lost to William & Mary, but continued with three more victories before their loss to St. John's as they were ranked #5. They finished the season with a victory over Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl, before sweeping the Southern Conference tournament for the fourth straight season, ranking #7 in the nation during the tourney. The squad made it to the semi-finals of the East Region of the 1960 NCAA tournament, but lost to #12 New York University, 81\u201382. They did finish out their tourney resume with a 106\u2013100 victory over St. Joseph's in the Regional Third Place matchup\n\nRod Thorn\nAfter the departure of Jerry West to the NBA draft, sophomore guard Rod Thorn stepped in to fill his place for new head coach George King, much like West did when star guard Hot Rod Hundley graduated for former head coach Fred Schaus in 1958. Thorn helped the Mountaineers to a 23\u20134 record, 11\u20131 in conference. Their highest ranking of the season came in the Southern Conference tournament, where they finished it out with a #8 ranking as they lost the Championship for the first time in four years. The Mountaineers season resume included wins over Wake Forest, #19 Memphis State to win the Sugar Bowl, Syracuse, Pittsburgh, Virginia Tech, NC State, and four more victories to end the season over Penn State, Pitt, Penn State again, and George Washington, respectively. The Mountaineers lost in the second round of the Southern Conference tournament to William & Mary, 76\u201388, which kept them out of the NCAA tournament.\nThe following season, Rod Thorn guided the Mountaineers to a 24\u20136 record, 11\u20131 in conference. The Mountaineers won the first six games of the season, but lost the seventh game of the season against #7 Duke, 65\u201369. They lost the following two games as they earned a #7 ranking, but finished out the three-game Los Angeles Classic with a victory over Army. They once again posted a seven-game win streak after the Classic, including a key win over #5 Villanova. But the squad lost to Virginia Tech, 82\u201385, before starting another win streak: of four games. The team lost to New York University, but won three games to finish the season. The squad swept the Southern Conference tournament with a Championship win over Virginia Tech, but lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to the same Villanova team they had defeated earlier in the season.\nIn Thorn's final season as a Mountaineer, effectively ending the era of WVU basketball, the team posted a 23\u20138 record with an 11\u20132 conference record. The team began the season ranked #5, but would end the season with unranked with a loss in the NCAA tournament semi-finals and a victory in the Regional Third Place matchup over #9 New York University. The #3 Mountaineers began the season with a loss to Ohio State in the third game of the season, 69\u201376. They followed three games later with a loss to #9 Kentucky, as they were ranked #7. The team went unranked before they posted two wins over Boston College in overtime and St. Bonaventure, before losing to #4 Illinois. The team went on a six-game run, where they reached a #9 ranking, but lost as the #6 team nationally to the #4 Duke Blue Devils, 71\u2013111, and then the following loss to Furman. The squad posted three more wins, but then lost again to William & Mary and Pittsburgh. The team won five straight games to finish the season, including sweeping the Southern Conference tournament for the consecutive season. The squad opened up the NCAA tournament with a victory over Connecticut, but then lost in the east region semi-finals to St. Joseph's.\n\n2001\u20132005 senior class\nOther than the late 1950s teams of Jerry West, Rod Hundley, Rod Thorn, and such other greats, the senior squad of 2001\u20132005 was one of the greatest teams of the school's history, mainly in the 2005\u201306 campaign. The starting lineup consisted of Johannes Herber and Frank Young (junior) at forward, while J.D. Collins and Mike Gansey played guards. Kevin Pittsnogle started at center, though he led the team with three-point shots. Senior Patrick Beilein (former coach John Beilein's son) got considerable playing time as well. The senior class was led by team MVPs Gansey and Pittsnogle, who were both named to the All-Big East team. The team advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament before losing to Texas 74\u201371 due to a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. This loss marked the end of an era. It consisted of back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances, the first since the 1959 and 1960 teams of Jerry West, and an overall record of 77\u201351.\n\n2007 NIT Championship\nThe team that followed the 2001\u20132005 senior class was projected to be weak and undeveloped due to lack of experience. Frank Young was the only senior that got considerable playing time from the previous year, although center Rob Summers was a senior as well. Young started at forward, along with Da'Sean Butler, Wellington Smith, and Joe Alexander who all shared time. The guard position consisted of starter Darris Nichols and Alex Ruoff, although Ted Talkington got small action in a few games. Rob Summers started at center all year but shared time with back up center Jamie Smalligan. The primary starting line up was Nichols, Ruoff, Young, Alexander, and Summers, although all other players shared fairly equal time, including forward Da'Sean Butler off the bench.\nThe team, projected to have a bad year with a tough Big East schedule, started out their season 5\u20130 with an easy early schedule. After a loss to Arkansas, they posted an 8\u20130 record to make their season record 13\u20131 before suffering two losses to Notre Dame and Marquette to make their record 13\u20133. After a win against USF and an overtime loss at Cincinnati, the Mountaineers won four games to make their record 18\u20134.  They were beaten by 13 at home to nationally ranked Pittsburgh, followed by one of the biggest upsets in school history.  The upset of #2 UCLA 70\u201365 made the Mountaineers 19\u20135, although they lost to Georgetown the next week to make their record 19\u20136. After a win against Seton Hall, they lost back-to-back against Providence and Pittsburgh both on the road.  They then finished out the regular season with a home blowout of Cincinnati to make their record 21\u20138.\nThe Mountaineers then beat Providence in the first round of the Big East tournament. In the second round, the Mountaineers held with the Louisville Cardinals for two-overtimes, but lost 82\u201371.  The Mountaineers failed to be selected for the NCAA tournament, to the surprise of many West Virginia fans, but they managed to accept a #1 seed in the NIT.  The Mountaineers then posted an easy win against Delaware State. The second round the Mountaineers won a shootout 90\u201377 against UMass, then a nail biting win against North Carolina State at home to win the east region, making the first NIT semifinal appearance since 1981. The semifinal contest against Mississippi State was one of the great wins in Mountaineer history, in which Darris Nichols hit the game-winning three-point shot to win the game 63\u201362 for the Mountaineers. Two days later in the National Invitation Tournament, the Mountaineers, led by Frank Young's 24 points and Da'Sean Butler's 20 points off the bench, beat Clemson 78\u201372 to win the university's second NIT crown after their 1942 victory.\n\nBob Huggins era\n2007\u20132023\nA few days after WVU won the 2007 National Invitation Tournament, coach John Beilein announced he would be leaving the school to accept a head coaching job with Michigan. His official departure on April 4, 2007, was followed a day later by the announcement that Morgantown native Bob Huggins was resigning his post at Kansas State to take the vacant head coaching job at WVU. Huggins was followed by assistant coach Billy Hahn.\nThe Mountaineers earned an 88\u201365 win over Mountain State in an exhibition game to start the season. West Virginia then entered a match-up against #7 Tennessee with a 2\u20130 record. However, the Mountaineers lost 74\u201372. The Mountaineers then posted an eight-game win streak on the way to a 10\u20131 record. The streak consisted of wins over Auburn, Winthrop, and New Mexico State. West Virginia then lost to Oklahoma 88\u201382 and then Notre Dame 69\u201356. They defeated #11 Marquette, 79\u201364, but followed up with a loss to Louisville 63\u201354. They then posted four-straight wins over Syracuse, St. John's, South Florida, and Marshall. The Mountaineers then lost to #9 Georgetown 58\u201357, after a questionable block (or goaltending) call to end the game. However, West Virginia could not rebound in the next game, and lost to Huggins' former job, at Cincinnati, to a final score of 62\u201339. They rebounded with a 77\u201365 victory at Providence, but then lost at #25 Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl on a buzzer-beating three-point shot by Pitt's Ronald Ramon to win the game, 55\u201354.\nWith their record at 16\u20137, the Mountaineers followed up with an 81\u201363 victory over Rutgers, then an 89\u201368 victory over Seton Hall. The Mountaineers were then upset by Villanova, 56\u201378, but bounced back with an 80\u201353 victory over Providence. The Mountaineers earned their 20th win of the season in an 85\u201373 victory over DePaul. With their record at 20\u20138, the Mountaineers extended its 20-win season streak to four seasons, the best ever since a seven-season streak from 1981 to 1987. Bob Huggins' 20-win season moved his record to at least 20 wins in 22 of his 26 seasons coaching. His twenty 20-win seasons in his collegiate career at the Division 1 level is tied for 12th place all-time. \"I'm old,\" Huggins said of the accomplishment.\nAfter the DePaul victory, the Mountaineers lost a critical game to #16 Connecticut, 79\u201371. However, Joe Alexander scored a then career-high 32 points and added another 10 rebounds. In the following game, the Backyard Brawl and Senior Night, the Mountaineers won their home game finale over their archrival, the Pittsburgh Panthers, 76\u201362, to improve to 10\u20137 in the conference and move to 6th place. Joe Alexander again had a career day by posting a consecutive 32-point performance, also adding 6 rebounds.\nThe Mountaineers finished the year with an 83\u201374 overtime victory over St. John's, then opened the Big East tournament with a 58\u201353 victory over Providence. In the second round of the tourney, the Mountaineers upset the #15-ranked Connecticut Huskies, 78\u201372. Joe Alexander contributed with a career-high 34 points and 7 rebounds. The Mountaineers then, however, lost to the #9 Georgetown Hoyas, 55\u201372, in the tourney semifinals.\nThe run to the Big East semifinals paved the way for the team to reach the 2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in coach Huggins' first season. The Mountaineers received a #7 seed in the west region, set to play the #10 seed Arizona Wildcats, on March 20. The Mountaineers were victorious over Arizona in their first game of the NCAA tournament with a final score of 75\u201365.  This advanced the Mountaineers into the second round of the tournament to play the Duke Blue Devils for the third time in school history. The team then beat #2 seed Duke, 73\u201367. They lost the Sweet Sixteen match to #3 seed Xavier in overtime, 79\u201375. West Virginia finished the season ranked #17.\n\n2008\u20132009\nWest Virginia began the 2008 season projected to finish 9th in the Big East under Huggins. However, they began the season 4\u20130, led by senior Alex Ruoff, junior Da'Sean Butler, and a freshman class highlighted by Devin Ebanks, Kevin Jones and Darryl Bryant. They lost the Las Vegas Invitational Tournament Championship Game to Kentucky 54\u201343, but then bounced back with two wins to move to 6\u20131. However, they lost a last-second game to #22 Davidson and Stephen Curry in Madison Square Garden, 68\u201365.\nFollowing the loss, WVU posted five straight victories; ending at the beginning of 2009. This streak included a 76\u201348 win over #13 Ohio State in Columbus, snapping the Buckeyes' nation-long 14-game win streak and handing OSU their biggest home loss since 1998. However, the streak ended in a 61\u201355 loss to #5 Connecticut which was followed by a 75\u201353 loss to #15 Marquette. The Mountaineers bounced back with a three-game win streak that included a 75\u201358 victory over #14 Georgetown in Washington, D.C. However, the streak ended in the 79\u201367 loss to #4 Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl. WVU defeated St. John's, but then lost to #7 Louisville and #20 Syracuse back-to-back. The Mountaineers ended the losing streak with an 86\u201359 win over Providence, but then lost to #4 Pittsburgh for the second time.\nWest Virginia followed the loss to Pittsburgh with a 93\u201372 victory over #13 Villanova, featuring Da'Sean Butler's career-high 43 point performance. The Mountaineers then defeated Notre Dame and Rutgers before losing to Cincinnati 70\u201359 in Huggins's return to Cincinnati. The Mountaineers bounced back with consecutive wins against USF and DePaul, but lost to #6 Louisville 62\u201359 in Morgantown while hosting College GameDay.\nWest Virginia earned a first round bye in the Big East tournament, and opened the second round of play with a 74\u201362 victory over Notre Dame. In the quarterfinals round, West Virginia defeated rival #2 Pittsburgh 74\u201360 in a shocking upset. The Mountaineers next played the #20 Syracuse Orange in the semi-finals, losing 74\u201369 in overtime. WVU's second consecutive trip to the Big East semi-finals paved the way for a #6 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they would play the #11 seed Dayton Flyers. However, the Mountaineers would be upset by Dayton to the score of 68\u201360, ending the season.\n\n2009\u20132010\nThe 2009\u201310 West Virginia Mountaineers team captured the first Big East tournament championship in school history and won the east region to advance to the second Final Four in school history, where they lost in the national semi-finals (Final Four) to eventual national champion Duke, 78\u201357 after Da'Sean Butler tore his ACL with 8:59 left in the 2nd half. The team finished #3 in the final Coaches Poll with a record of 31\u20137, setting the record for most wins in school history.

This was an in-conference rivalry for many years: 1976 to 1982 in the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League and Eastern Athletic Association (predecessors to the Atlantic 10 Conference) and 1995 to 2012 in the Big East Conference. Following the conference realignment, West Virginia moved to the Big 12 Conference in 2012, and Pittsburgh moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2013 and the series was put on hold until the 2017\u20132018 season. West Virginia has a 97\u201388 series lead.\n\nMaryland\nWest Virginia's interstate rivalry against Maryland dates back to 1926. Except for a period when both schools were in the Southern Conference from 1950 to 1953, this has been primarily an out-of-conference rivalry. From the 1963\u201364 to 1970\u201371 seasons, the series was played twice a season, on a home-and-home basis. The series was again played annually from the 1983\u201384 to 1988\u201389 seasons then 1990\u201391 to 1992\u201393 seasons. In December 2003, the two schools played in Washington, D. C. for the BB&T Classic, with West Virginia winning 78\u201377 in overtime.\nIn May 2008, West Virginia assistant coach Billy Hahn announced that he and Maryland head coach Gary Williams proposed a home-and-home series that would begin after the 2008\u201309 season. This plan never materialized, but Maryland and West Virginia met again in the third round of the NCAA tournament on March 22, 2015, with West Virginia winning 69\u201359. The Mountaineers met Maryland once again in the NCAA Tournament in the Round of 64 on March 16, 2023 in which Maryland won 67-65.\n\nPenn State\nWest Virginia had an interstate rivalry with Penn State from 1906 to 1991. The series was played twice annually from the 1982\u201383 to 1990\u201391 seasons, as both schools were in the Atlantic 10 Conference then. WVU leads the series 66\u201353.\n\nVirginia Tech\nWest Virginia has an interstate multisport rivalry with the Virginia Tech Hokies. Although the rivalry is heavily focused on football, it also spans to other collegiate sports between the two schools, including basketball. The location of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, along the Appalachian Mountains puts it in direct competition with West Virginia University. It is not uncommon to see families along the Virginia/West Virginia border to be split between the two rivals.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Mountaineers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 31 times. Their combined record is 38\u201331.\n\nNCAA tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament in 1978.\n\nNIT results\nThe Mountaineers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 16 times.

  "Wichita State Shockers": {
    "biography": "The Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team is the NCAA Division I college basketball program representing Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas.\nThe Shockers have made 16 appearances in the NCAA tournament, reaching the Final Four twice, the Elite Eight four times, and the Sweet Sixteen six times. The team plays its home games at Charles Koch Arena, where it averaged 10,391 fans per game in 2012, ranking 38th nationally.\nThe Shockers have made two Final Four appearances, losing both games. They made their first Final Four appearance in 1965 losing to UCLA 108\u201389. They made their second appearance in 2013, losing to Louisville 72\u201368.\nIn 2014, Wichita State defeated the Northern Iowa Panthers in the regular season finale for their 9th Missouri Valley conference regular season title, becoming two-time defending MVC champions. The Shockers completed a perfect, undefeated regular season and swept the conference post-season tournament en route to a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament where they lost to eventual national runner-up Kentucky in the round of 32.\nThe Shockers competed in the Missouri Valley Conference from 1949\u201350 to 2016\u201317 and have competed in the American Athletic Conference, now known as the American Conference, since the 2017\u201318 season.\n\nHistory\nWichita State, then known as Fairmount College, first took the court in 1906 under head coach Willis Bates. During this time, the sports teams were known as the \"Wheatshockers\". The first official game was held in the basement of Fairmount Hall. Fairmount lost to Washburn University by a score of 37\u201310. During this inaugural season, the Wheatshockers only won two games.\nFairmount acquired a permanent home when Memorial Gymnasium was opened on January 15, 1921, in a game against the American Legion of Wichita. The gym was later renamed Henrion Gymnasium in 1926. That same year, the newly renamed Municipal University of Wichita (popularly known as \"WU\") joined the Central Conference in athletics.\nWU gained notice outside of Wichita in 1927 when, led by First-Team All-American Ross McBurney and Second-Team All-American Harold Reynolds, the Wheatshockers finished the 1927 season with a 13\u20131 record and a second-place finish behind conference champions Pittsburg State University.\n\nEarly success\nShocker basketball achieved greater success with the arrival of Coach Ralph Miller and Cleo Littleton in 1951. Littleton averaged 18.2 points per game as a freshman, a school record that still stands today. He was the first player west of the Mississippi to score 2,000 points in his college career and is one of only five Wichita State players to have his number retired. He was also one of the first African American players in the Missouri Valley Conference, which it joined in 1945. Littleton averaged 19 points per game during his career and he still owns 7 school records. Due to this success, Wichita State decided to construct a new home for the Shockers. Through appropriated money by the WU Board of Regents, Wichita State was able to construct a new field house for the men's basketball team, costing $1.4 million. On December 3, 1955, the Shockers played their first game in WU Field House in front of more than 9,000 fans.\nDave Stallworth entered the program in the 1961\u201362 season. Nicknamed \"The Rave\", Stallworth became the Shockers' first consensus All-American in 1964. He finished with a career scoring average of 24.2 points per game and was second on the all-time scoring list with 1,936 points. During his 13-year stint at WSU, Ralph Miller became the winningest coach in Shocker basketball history, collecting 255 victories. Miller is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and currently ranks as the eighth-winningest coach in college basketball history.\n\nFirst Final Four\nThe 1964\u201365 season\u2014the first after Wichita joined the state university system as Wichita State University\u2014was the greatest in Shocker history until the 2013\u201314 season. On December 14, 1964, Gary Thompson led Wichita State to its first-ever No. 1 ranking. The 19\u20137 Shockers won the MVC and earned a berth into the Midwest Regional. After defeating Southern Methodist and an Oklahoma State team led by Henry Iba, the Shockers headed to the Final Four in Portland. There, the Shockers were matched against the defending national champion UCLA Bruins, losing 108\u201389. The Shockers played a third-place game against Princeton, losing 118\u201382.\nDuring this period, Warren Armstrong played for the Shockers and made major contributions throughout his career. During his sophomore season, Armstrong set two school records, averaging almost 12 rebounds a game while setting a Shocker single-game assist mark with 12. Armstrong became a three-time all-Valley performer from 1966 to 1968, and still holds four of WSU's 10 triple double games (double-figure points, rebounds, assist, or blocks). He would later enjoy a productive career in the ABA. Terry Benton became a key contributor during this era as well, setting a WSU record of 16.8 rebounds per game for his career, and finishing his Wichita State career with 1,003 points and 963 rebounds.\n\nHarry Miller era\nWichita State went 97\u201390 from 1971 to 1978 under Harry Miller. They had several notable players during those years including Rich Morsden, Bob Wilson, Robert Gray, Bob Trogele, Cheese Johnson, Cal Bruton and Robert Elmore. They made it to the NCAA tournament in 1976, winning the Missouri Valley Conference and losing by one point to eventual national runner up Michigan. The following year they beat eventual NCAA Champion Marquette in Al McGuire's final home game in Milwaukee.\n\nElite Eight appearance and sanctions\nIn 1981, the Shockers would return to the NCAA tournament, defeating the Kansas Jayhawks 66\u201365 in the \"Battle of New Orleans\" before being defeated by LSU 96\u201385 in the Elite Eight. The 1980\u201381 team featured two future NBA players \u2013 Cliff Levingston and Antoine Carr, who would be chosen in the first 10 picks of the NBA draft. Carr, a local star from Wichita, would become WSU's third All-American in 1983, averaging 22.2 points a game during his senior season, and finishing his career with 1,911 points while shooting 55.7 percent. Levingston would average 15.7 and 18.5 points per game while leading the team in scoring his freshman and sophomore years, before declaring early for the NBA Draft.\nAnother future NBA player, Xavier McDaniel, would arrive the year after the Elite Eight season. McDaniel scored 2,152 points at Wichita State, second all-time behind Littleton, and set the school record with 1,359 rebounds. In 1984\u201385, McDaniel became the first player in NCAA Division I history to lead the nation in scoring (27.2 points per game) and rebounding (14.8 per game) in the same season.\nIn 1982, Wichita State would be placed under NCAA probation for the 1982\u201383 and 1983\u201384 seasons, regarding improper actions of former assistant coaches in the late 1970s.\nIn nine seasons, Smithson won 155 games, placing him second in school history behind Ralph Miller. Smithson was the first coach to guide WSU to consecutive 20-win seasons. During the four-year span from 1980 to 1984, WSU produced a 92\u201329 record, the best four-year span in team history at the time.\n\nReturn to the tournament\nWSU hired Topeka, Kansas native Mark Turgeon as head coach on March 11, 2000. Turgeon guided the Shockers to a 9\u201319 record during his first season. In Turgeon's second year Wichita State began its resurgence with a combination of several veterans and newcomers to compile a 15\u201315 record in 2001\u201302.\nHelped by an 11\u20133 record in Levitt Arena, WSU's overall record in the arena rose to 502\u2013185 since it opened during the 1955\u201356 season. In the 2002\u201303 season, the Shockers would improve to 18 wins, and then to 21 wins in the 2003\u201304 season.\nIn 2004\u201305, Wichita State continued to improve, reaching the third game of the NIT, and taking the Shockers to back-to-back-to-back postseason trips for the first time since 1987\u201388\u201389. WSU's 2004\u201305 team went 22\u201310 overall, finished second in the Missouri Valley Conference, and were ranked in the top 30 for nine weeks.\nIn 2005\u201306, Turgeon lead WSU to its best season in over 20 years, reaching the Sweet 16 with victories over 10th seeded Seton Hall and shocking 2nd seeded Tennessee. In the Sweet 16, the Shockers would go on to lose to eventual Final Four participant George Mason.\nIn 2006\u201307, the Shockers entered the season with high expectations, and surged out to a 9\u20130 start, including a revenge-win over George Mason, as well as road victories over #6 LSU and #14 Syracuse. WSU rose as high as #8 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls on December 18, 2006, but the Shockers would struggle for much of the rest of the season, falling from the rankings and finishing 17\u201314, including only eight conference wins, for Turgeon's second worst mark as WSU head coach.\nHead Coach Mark Turgeon left Wichita State on April 10, 2007, after a seven-year run and a 128\u201390 record, (at the time) the third winningest coach in Shocker history behind Ralph Miller and Gene Smithson. On April 14, 2007, Gregg Marshall was announced as 26th head men's basketball coach at Wichita State.\n\nSecond Final Four and  undefeated regular season\nGregg Marshall previously coached at Winthrop University for nine seasons. In his first season (2007\u201308) the team finished with a record of 11\u201320. In his second season they posted a 17\u201317 record, complete with a run to the second round of the 2009 CBI Tournament where they lost to Stanford. The following season the Shockers went 25\u201310, culminating with an NIT appearance. The invitation was due in large part to their strong 16\u20131 home record. Their only loss at home that year was in the NIT against Nevada.\nIn the 2010\u201311 season Wichita State improved once again to finish the season at 29\u20138, finishing second in the Missouri Valley to Missouri State. The Shockers would go on to win the NIT championship as a 4 seed, defeating two #1 seeds, first Virginia Tech 79\u201376, and then beating Alabama in the championship game 66\u201357.\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, they continued to improve under Marshall's guidance. In winning the regular season MVC title at 16\u20132 (26\u20134 overall), the Shockers reached a ranking of #14 in the coaches poll and #15 in the AP poll. After losing to Illinois State in the semi-finals of the MVC tourney in St. Louis, the Shockers were selected at large for the NCAA tournament as a 5 seed, their first NCAA Tournament in 6 years.  They fell to VCU 62\u201359, ending the season with a 27\u20136 record.\nHeading into the 2012\u20132013 season, despite being the reigning regular-season champions, the Shockers were predicted to finish fourth in the Missouri Valley Conference. Wichita State went into the season having lost five of the top six scorers from the previous season, including Joe Ragland, Toure' Murry, Garrett Stutz, Ben Smith, and David Kyles. Despite the losses, the Shockers went on to win their first 9 games, including the Canc\u00fan Challenge, as well as 15 of their first 16, and 19 of their first 21. Wichita struggled in conference-play, however, losing three in a row in late January and early February. Nevertheless, the Shockers would eventually play rival Creighton in the final game of the season for the outright conference championship, losing in Omaha.\nIn the 2012\u201313 NCAA tournament, the Shockers upset top-seeded Gonzaga to move on to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2006, followed by a 72\u201358 win over La Salle for their first Elite Eight appearance since 1981. They defeated Ohio State 70\u201366 for their first Final Four appearance since 1965, as well as their 30th win of the season, a then-Wichita State record. In the Final Four, Wichita State was defeated by the #1 overall seed and eventual tournament champion Louisville, 72\u201368 but that game was later vacated in 2018 by the NCAA.\nThe 2013\u201314 season proved to be historic and possibly the greatest season in Shocker history. The Shockers cracked the top 10 at #2 in the nation in both major polls, for the first time since December 2006. It was the highest that the Shockers had been ranked that late in the season in school history. On February 25, with a win over Bradley, the Shockers became just the 11th Division I team to start the season 30\u20130. They were also the first team to do so solely in the regular season, as the prior 10 teams reached that mark in the postseason. A week later, with a dominating 68\u201345 win over Missouri State, the Shockers became the first Division I team to finish the regular season 31\u20130. The Shockers ran the table with the 2014 Missouri Valley Conference men's basketball tournament, winning all three games by double digits. This was the first time Wichita State won the Valley Tournament since 1987. The Shockers received the #1 ranking in the Midwest Region of the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Wichita State blew out their first opponent, Cal Poly, to become the first team in the history of college basketball to advance to a record of 35\u20130 (a mark matched by Kentucky in the 2014\u201315 season). The Shockers season ended with an instant classic of a game with the Kentucky Wildcats on a missed 3-pointer at the buzzer. Their final record ended up being 35\u20131.\n\nMarshall departure and decline\nAfter the 2019\u201320 season, eight Shockers players entered the NCAA transfer portal, with seven eventually leaving the program. During this period, several former players alleged a pattern of physical and verbal abuse of players, leading to the university hiring a St. Louis-based law firm to conduct an independent investigation. Marshall resigned shortly before the 2020\u201321 season, with Wichita State buying out his contract for $7.75 million over six years. Assistant coach Isaac Brown was named interim head coach for 2020\u201321.\nIn Brown's first year, he took the Shockers to the NCAA Tournament but lost to Drake in the First Four. During the season, he was named full-time head coach. The following 2 seasons, the Shockers would finish 32\u201328 and were not invited to any postseason tournament. This led to Wichita State firing Brown on March 11, 2023.\nWichita State hired Paul Mills on March 22, 2023.\n\nRivalries\nWhen Wichita State became an AP Top 25 regular in the early 2010s, there came interest in reviving annual games against Kansas and Kansas State. In February 2013, Kansas state senator Michael O'Donnell introduced a bill requiring Kansas and Kansas State to schedule Wichita State, but the bill never passed. Kansas and Wichita State scheduled a game for the 2023\u201324 season, their first regular season game since 1993. Wichita State last played Kansas in the 2015 NCAA tournament, a game they won 78\u201365. Kansas leads the all-time series 12\u20133. They last played Kansas State in the 2024\u201325 season, a game which they won 84\u201365. Kansas State leads the all-time series 20\u201310.\n\nMissouri State\nWichita State had an in-conference rivalry with Missouri State dating back to the 1941\u201342 season (when Missouri State University was Southwest Missouri State Teacher's College). As of the 2016\u201317 season, following a 15-game winning streak in the series, Wichita State leads the series 39\u201330.\n\nTulsa\nWichita State's rivalry with Tulsa dates back to the 1930\u201331 season. The two schools were in the Missouri Valley Conference from 1945 to 1996. Beginning in the 1996\u201397 season, this series continued as an out-of-conference rivalry and has been most recently continuously played since the 2010\u201311 season, after being played in the 1996\u201397, 1997\u201398, and 2000\u201301 to 2004\u201305 seasons. As of the end of the 2020\u201321 season, Wichita State leads the series 72\u201362 following 15 games since the series resumed in 2010. Tulsa ended WSU's 5-game winning streak with a buzzer-beating 3-point win in Tulsa in February 2020, but WSU has won three since then, two at home and one on the road, including a tight 4-point game.\n\nCreighton\nWichita State had an intense rivalry with the Creighton Bluejays during their time together in the Missouri Valley. Both squads were known as the cream of the crop in the MVC and went back and forth every year, trading the title of best team in the league. In all, the teams have played a total of 100 games against each other, with Creighton leading the overall series 55\u201345.\n\nFacilities\nThe Shockers have played their home games at Charles Koch Arena, a 10,506 seat on-campus arena, since 1953. Originally known as the University of Wichita Field House, it was officially renamed Levitt Arena in 1969 for Henry Levitt, owner of Henry's, who sponsored a Wichita basketball team (known as the Henry Clothiers) that won three consecutive national Amateur Athletic Union titles in the 1930s. Due to its circular design, which gave nearly every fan a clear sight line and put the seats very close to the action, it was quickly nicknamed \"The Roundhouse.\" Following a $6 million endowment from Charles G. Koch the arena underwent a $25 million renovation in 2002\u201303, popularly known as the \"Roundhouse Renaissance.\" The old arena concourse was completely demolished and a new one built around the original playing/seating area. A portion of the seating bowl was remodeled to make for more legroom. All new seating was installed as well as a video scoreboard, and virtually every surface that was not renovated was given a fresh coat of paint. The Shocker basketball teams played at the Kansas Coliseum for the 2002\u201303 season while the arena was rebuilt. In 2012, the Shockers averaged 10,391 fans per game, ranking 38th nationally. In January 2013, ESPN's Jason King listed Koch Arena as the 7th best home court advantage in college basketball.\nIn addition to Koch Arena, the Shockers have played one game for each of the last eleven seasons (except 2020\u201321) across town at the Intrust Bank Arena, the second largest indoor arena in the state of Kansas at 15,004 seats. Wichita State is  8\u20133 (as of the 2020\u201321 season) when playing at Intrust Bank Arena.\n\nCoaches\nThe Shockers have had 27 head coaches in program history. Of these, only 7 coached five or more seasons. They have had two different coaches take them to the Final Four and seven different coaches have taken them to the NCAA Tournament. Gregg Marshall is the all-time leader in wins, win percentage among coaches who have coached at least 25 games, tournament appearances, and tournament wins. Marshall also has just as many tournament appearances as every other coach in program history combined and is the longest-tenured head coach in program history having coached for 13 seasons.\n\nCoaching history\nNotable players\nRetired numbers\nPlayers in the NBA/ABA\nPlayers in international leagues\nGrant Sherfield (born 1999), in the Israeli Basketball Premier League\n\nOlympians\nThe following Shockers represented their country in the Olympics.

    "biography": "The Winthrop Eagles men's basketball team represents Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, United States and competes in the Big South Conference. Winthrop plays their home games in the 6,100 seat Winthrop Coliseum. Winthrop has appeared 11 times in the NCAA tournament, most recently in 2021. The Eagles earned the program's only win ever at the NCAA tournament at the 2007 NCAA tournament, earning a 74-64 upset win over #6 seeded Notre Dame. The Eagles have played 45 seasons of basketball since their inaugural 1978\u201379 campaign.\n\nTeam history\nRise to mid-major prominence\nDuring the late 1990s and 2000s, Winthrop established itself as one of the most successful mid-major programs in college basketball, reaching the NCAA Tournament eight times in 10 seasons. From 1998 to 2008, the Eagles posted a 216\u201395 overall record and went 114\u201328 in Big South play. During this stretch, Winthrop defeated programs from high major conferences like the ACC (Clemson, Georgia Tech, #19 Miami in 2007), Big East (Marquette, #17 Notre Dame in the NCAA tournament, Providence), and SEC (Georgia, Mississippi State). Winthrop also beat Missouri in 2000. \nSince 2009, Winthrop has defeated over 30 non-conference D1 teams including: Auburn (SEC), Clemson (ACC), Wake Forest (ACC), East Carolina, East Tennessee State, Furman, Georgia Southern, Illinois (Big 10), James Madison, Manhattan College, Ohio University, #18 Saint Mary's in 2019, St. Louis, UNC Greensboro, Portland, San Diego, Washington (PAC 12), and William & Mary. Winthrop beat the ACC, SEC, PAC 12, and Big 10 schools at the opposing school.\n\nNeild Gordon era (1978\u20131986)\nWinthrop's first head coach, Neild Gordon, recorded 25 wins and 10 losses in the Eagle's first season. He finished with an average win percentage of .615 and 20 wins per season during his tenure at WU. Gordon was later inducted into Winthrop University's Athletics Hall of Fame, the Furman University Athletic Hall of Fame, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Halls of Fame, and the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nSteve Vacendak era (1986\u20131992)\nFormer Duke point guard and ACC Player of the Year, Steve Vacendak coached the Eagles from 1986 to 1992. In Winthrop's second season as a Division I program, he led the 4th seeded eagles to their first Big South tournament victory.\n\nDan Kenney era (1993\u20131998)\nDan Kenney was the head coach of the Eagles during the mid-1990s and finished his tenure with a record of 51-113. WU athletic director Tom Hickman reportedly said that Kenney \"graduated his players, ran a clean, upstanding program and did everything first class but had to be relieved of his coaching duties because the school could no longer carry his losing record.\"\n\nGregg Marshall era (1998\u20132007)\nGregg Marshall coached the Eagles from 1998 to 2007, engineering one of the great program turnarounds in NCAA history.  In just his first season at the helm, he led the Eagles to a 21\u20138 record and an appearance in the 1999 Men's Division 1 Tournament. This success continued as his team would go on to make the Tournament in each of the next three seasons, establishing a winning tradition that would last into the 2010s. Overall, he posted a 194\u201383 overall record during his nine-year tenure. Marshall led the Eagles to a 104\u201324 conference record, six Big South season titles, and seven Big South tournament titles.  Winthrop appeared in seven NCAA Tournaments, posted six 20-win seasons, and averaged 21.5 victories per year during the Marshall Era. In April 2007, Marshall left Winthrop to become the head coach at Wichita State.\n\nRandy Peele era (2007\u20132012)\nRandy Peele posted a 77\u201382 overall record (48\u201338 Big South) as head coach from 2007 to 2012.  He led the Eagles to one Big South season title and two Big South tournament titles. Winthrop appeared in two NCAA Tournaments and notched one 20-win season under Peele's leadership. Randy Peele was relieved of his coaching duties at Winthrop on March 5, 2012.\n\nPat Kelsey era (2012\u20132021)\nFormer Xavier and Wake Forest assistant Pat Kelsey was announced as Winthrop's new coach on March 29, 2012.  Over nine seasons with the Eagles, Kelsey went 186\u201395 (.662) overall and 110\u201346 (.705) in the Big South and led Winthrop to three Big South season championships (2016, 2017, 2021), three Big South tournament championships (2017, 2020, 2021), and three Big South Tournament runner-up finishes (2014, 2015, 2016).  In 2020\u201321, Kelsey's last season with the team, the Eagles went nearly undefeated, finishing 23-2, and led the Big South in assists, steals, points per game, scoring margin, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, and rebounding offense.\nUnder Kelsey, the Eagles' style of play exhibited a fast-paced, high scoring offense and pack line defense. Kelsey's Eagles broke multiple school records in categories such as free throw accuracy, blocked shots, three-pointers made, offensive pace, and points scored in a single game.\nWith the help of assistant coaches like Brian Kloman, Kelsey developed a successful local and international recruiting pipeline and signed some of the top players in WU's history.  This includes Winthrop's all-time leading rebounder and shot-blocker, Xavier Cooks, and Winthrop's all-time leading scorer, Keon Johnson.  Kelsey's program signed D2 transfer Chandler Vaudrin, the then college national leader in triple-doubles and D. J. Burns., an ESPN 4-star recruit and transfer from the University of Tennessee. In March 2021, Kelsey left Winthrop to become the head coach at the College of Charleston.\n\nMark Prosser era (2021\u2013present)\nIn April 2021, Mark Prosser, former Winthrop assistant and son of Skip Prosser, returned to take the head coach position vacated by Pat Kelsey. Six games into his first season, the Eagles beat the University of Washington to notch Prosser's first win as head coach at WU against a Power 5 conference and Winthrop's first win ever against a PAC-12 team. Additionally, the 2021-2022 team went undefeated at home (13\u20130) and finished first in the Big South Conference South Division.\nThe 2022-2023 Eagles finished with a record of 15\u201317, which was Winthrop's first losing season in a decade. Many attributed the poor record to multiple players being injured throughout the season. In Prosser's third season (2023-2024), the Eagles lost by 10 points or less (in road games) to three Power 5 teams (i.e., South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida State) in the non-conference portion of the season. They finished with a 17\u201315 record and lost to Longwood in the first round of the Big South Tournament. The #5 seeded Lancers went on to win the Big South Championship. In 2024-2025, Prosser's Eagles finished 23-11. They played in the Big South Conference Championship game and, although having a double digit lead at halftime (39-29), lost to High Point 81-69.\n\n2007 Season: Top 25 and Round of 32\nWinthrop's greatest success to date was in 2007, as it went 29\u20135 under Coach Marshall and finished #22 nationally in both the AP and Coaches' Final Polls.  The Eagles posted a perfect 14\u20130 mark in conference play, winning the Big South regular season championship.  Notable regular season non-conference victories included wins against Mississippi State and Old Dominion.  Each of Winthrop's four regular season losses came at the hand of a Top 25 opponent, with two of the games decided by single-digit margins. They lost to the #2 program in the country (UNC) by seven points.\nAfter winning the Big South Tournament, the Eagles were given a #11 seed in the NCAA Tournament and a First Round matchup against #6 seed Notre Dame.

    "biography": "The Wisconsin Badgers are an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big Ten Conference. The Badgers' home games are played at the Kohl Center, located on the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison campus in Madison, Wisconsin. Wisconsin has 1,732 wins through the end of the 2024\u201325 season which is top 50 all-time among Division I college basketball programs. Wisconsin has appeared in the NCAA tournament 28 times. The Wisconsin Badgers currently have 50 players in their 1,000-point club as well.\n\nHistory\nEarly years (1898\u20131911)\nWisconsin Badger basketball began in December, 1898 with the formation of its first team coached by Dr. James C. Elsom. The Badgers played their first game on January 21, 1899, losing to the Milwaukee Normal Alumni 25\u201315 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin [1]. In 1905, Christian Steinmetz became the first Wisconsin Badger basketball player to be named All-American. In the 1906\u201307 season, Wisconsin won its first share of the Big Ten Championship, under the coaching of Emmett Dunn Angell. They won it again the next year in 1908.\n\nWalter Meanwell era (1911\u20131934)\nWalter Meanwell began coaching the Badgers in 1911. In his first season, he led Wisconsin to an undefeated season (15\u20130), and then led them to another 15\u20130 season in 1913\u201314. Meanwell's teams would win eight Big Ten Championships during his tenure, in 1912, 1913, 1914, 1916, 1921, 1923, 1924, and 1929. Between the 1917\u201318 and 1919\u201320 seasons, Guy Lowman coached the Badgers, leading them to a 1918 Big Ten Conference Championship before Meanwell returned in 1920. Meanwell would also coach two All-Americans during his Wisconsin career, George Levis in 1916 and Harold \"Bud\" Foster in 1930. On December 18, 1930, the first game was played in the new Wisconsin Field House, a basketball arena with a capacity of 11,500.\n\nBud Foster era (1934\u20131959)\nStarting with the 1934\u201335 season, former UW basketball player Bud Foster began coaching the Wisconsin Badgers. In his first season as head coach, he led the Badgers to their 12th Big Ten Conference Championship in 28 years. In 1941, Foster led the Badgers to their only national championship in history. With the help of tournament MOP John Kotz and All-American Gene Englund, the Badgers beat Washington State 39\u201334 in the final game of the NCAA Tournament. It was their first ever invitation to the NCAA Tournament, after winning the Big Ten Championship in that year. Foster coached three All-Americans during his tenure \u2013 Gene Englund in 1941, John Kotz in 1942 and Don Rehfeldt in 1950. The Badgers won one more Big Ten championship in 1947 and attended their second NCAA Tournament. It would be their last postseason appearance of any sort for 42 years, and their last NCAA appearance for 47 years.\n\n1959\u20131994\nThe mediocre records of the last decade of Foster's tenure would remain largely the norm for the Badgers for the next four decades.  From 1954 to 1995, the Badgers would have only eight winning seasons.  They also notched only two winning records in Big Ten play and finished as high as fourth only four times.  Among the few bright spots during this time were the 1962 win over number one ranked Ohio State and stars Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek, NIT appearances under Steve Yoder in 1989 and 1991, and another in 1992 under Stu Jackson.  The revival of Wisconsin basketball began in the early 1990s, when Yoder and Jackson recruited and developed Michael Finley, Tracy Webster, Rashard Griffith and other talented players.  In 1994, the Badgers returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1947 and notched their first win in that tournament since winning it all in 1941.\n\nDick Bennett era (1995\u20132000)\nIn 1995, Dick Bennett then took over after leading Wisconsin-Green Bay to mid-major prominence.  In 1997, he led the Badgers to their first winning Big Ten record in 23 years, and only their second in 43 years.  The Badgers began a run of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances in 1999, and reached the NCAA tournament Final Four in 2000.\nIn 2000, the Badgers entered the NCAA tournament seeded #8 in the West bracket. Beyond most expectations, they defeated #9 Fresno St, #1 Arizona, #4 LSU, and #6 Purdue in order to advance to the Final Four. However, the Badgers then lost to #1 and eventual national champion Michigan State, 53\u201341.\nAfter three games into the 2000\u201301 season (in which he went 2\u20131), Bennett abruptly retired due to burnout. His final game was a 78\u201375 win over eventual Final Four participant Maryland. Assistant Brad Soderberg was named interim head coach. Soderberg led Wisconsin to a 16\u201310 record (18\u201311 overall), but was upset in the first round of the NCAA tournament by Georgia State.\n\nBo Ryan era (2001\u20132015)\nSoderberg was let go at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, and Wisconsin hired University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee coach Bo Ryan as the new head coach. Ryan had previously won four Division III national championships at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville.\nCoach Bo Ryan brought the program continued success, achieving greater regular season and NCAA tournament success in his 15-year tenure than the program had achieved over the prior 60 years. Since the late 1990s Wisconsin has turned into a basketball powerhouse making regular trips to the NCAA Tournament. Since 2001-2002 Wisconsin has finished in the top 4 in the Big Ten regular season standings 19 times in the past 21 seasons, and have won 6 Big Ten regular season championships and 3 Big Ten tournament championships.\nIn the 2001\u201302 season, under the new leadership of Bo Ryan, the Badgers went 19\u201313 (11\u20135) and won a share of the Big Ten regular season title for the first time since 1947, tying for first place in the Big Ten with Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio State. The Badgers defeated St. John's 90\u201380 in Ryan's first NCAA tournament game before falling to eventual national champion Maryland.\nDuring the 2002\u201303 season, Wisconsin secured its first outright regular season conference title in 56 years. The Badgers lost in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament to Ohio State. They then attended the NCAA tournament with a #5 seed, beating Weber State in the first round and Tulsa in the second round. The Badgers then lost to Kentucky in the Sweet Sixteen.\nIn the 2003\u201304 season, Wisconsin finished second in the Big Ten behind Illinois. They went on to win the Big Ten tournament for the first time since its inception in 1998. The Badgers defeated Minnesota in a quarterfinal, rallied to beat Michigan State in a semifinal, and defeated Illinois in the final. However, because the game was played too late to be taken under consideration by the NCAA tournament selection committee, the Badgers received a #6 seed. They defeated Richmond in the first round before losing to #3 seed Pittsburgh in the second round.\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, Wisconsin finished third in the Big Ten. In the Big Ten tournament semifinal against Iowa, Alando Tucker made a long shot at the buzzer to give UW a 3-point win, but the Badgers lost to #1 ranked Illinois in the championship. In the 2005 NCAA tournament, Wisconsin advanced to the Elite Eight by defeating #11 seed Northern Iowa, #14 seed Bucknell, and #10 seed North Carolina State before losing to #1 and eventual national champion, North Carolina.\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, the Badgers had a somewhat disappointing season that culminated in a loss to Indiana in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals, and another loss to Arizona in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The highlight of the season was a win over intrastate rival Marquette.\nThe Badgers' lone non-conference loss was against Missouri State. On February 19, 2007, the Badgers earned their first #1 ranking in school history with a 26\u20132 record, but the next day, were defeated by the unranked Michigan State Spartans 64\u201355 at the Breslin Center. Entering the Big Ten tournament as the #2 seed, they defeated Michigan State 70\u201357. The Badgers defeated the Fighting Illini in the semi-finals, 53\u201341, to advance to the finals against Ohio State, where they were beaten 66\u201349.\nThe Badgers were selected as a 2nd seed in the NCAA tournament, but were defeated by 7th-seeded UNLV in the second round.\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, the Badgers finished first in the Big Ten, winning the Big Ten regular season outright and the conference tournament, defeating the Illinois Fighting Illini in the finals. In the NCAA tournament, the Badgers were awarded a No. 3 seed and won their first game against California State University, Fullerton. They followed that up with a win in the second round over Michael Beasley and the Kansas State Wildcats, due in part to 25 points from sophomore Trevon Hughes. The Badgers then lost to the No. 10 seed Davidson Wildcats and Stephen Curry by a score of 73\u201356 in the Sweet Sixteen.\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, the Badgers finished tied for 4th in the Big Ten with an overall record of 19\u201311 and 10\u20138 in the Big Ten. In the NCAA tournament, the Badgers were awarded a No. 12 seed and upset No. 5 seed Florida State University in the first round, 61\u201359. In the second round the Badgers lost 60\u201349 to the No. 4 seed Xavier University. The Badgers finished the 2008\u201309 season with an overall record of 20\u201313.\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, Wisconsin defeated three top 5-ranked teams during the regular season: Duke, Purdue, and Michigan State. The Badgers finished the season tied for 4th in the Big Ten, with a record of 23\u20137 overall and 13\u20135 in the Big Ten. In the NCAA tournament, the Badgers were awarded a #4 seed. They beat #13 seed Wofford in the first round, 53\u201349. In the second round the Badgers lost 87\u201369 to the #12 seed Cornell University. The Badgers finished the 2009\u201310 season with an overall record of 24\u20139.\nRyan led the Badgers to the school's third undefeated season at home in 2010\u201311. The Badgers finished 25\u20139 overall (13\u20135 Big Ten). In February 2011, they beat then-undefeated Ohio State University, the school's second win over the AP No. 1 team. After falling to Penn State in the first round of the Big Ten tournament, the Badgers secured a No. 4-seed in the NCAA Tournament.  The team beat 13th-seed Belmont and fifth-seed Kansas State. They fell to Butler in the Sweet Sixteen. Jordan Taylor was named a second-team All-American, and Jon Leuer was honorable mention. Leuer was selected in the second round of the NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks.\nThe Badgers finished the 2011\u201312 season 26\u201310 overall (12\u20136 Big Ten). In the Big Ten tournament, Wisconsin was the #4 seed and defeated the #5 seed Hoosiers before losing to the #1 seed Spartans. In the NCAA Tournament, the Badgers were awarded the 4th-seed in the East Region. The team defeated 13th-seeded Montana and 5th-seeded Vanderbilt. In the regional semifinal, Wisconsin faced the #1 seeded Syracuse, losing 64\u201363.\nThe 2012\u201313 Badgers lost junior starting point guard Josh Gasser, who tore his ACL in October. Wisconsin defeated Michigan and Indiana in the Big Ten tournament before losing to Ohio State in the championship. The Badgers earned a #5 seed in the NCAA Tournament and faced #12 seed Ole Miss, where they were upset 57\u201346. The Badgers finished with a 23\u201312 record, including a 12\u20136 mark in Big Ten play.\nIn the 2013\u201314 season, the Badgers tallied 16 wins before their first loss of the season at the hands of Indiana. They lost four of their next five games. The team finished the Big Ten schedule with one loss to Nebraska in the regular season finale, earning the #2 seed in the Big Ten tournament. They lost in the semi-finals to the Michigan State Spartans. The Badgers were awarded a #2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They beat #15 seed American, then Oregon, Baylor, and the #1 seed Arizona Wildcats. This led to the third Final Four appearance for the Badgers in school history. The Badgers lost the Final Four match-up with Kentucky, when Aaron Harrison hit a last second three pointer.\nIn the 2014\u20132015 season the Badgers won the Big Ten title outright and the Big Ten tournament title. They received their first #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, entering the tournament ranked #3 in the nation. The Badgers locked up their second consecutive Final Four appearance with an 85\u201378 victory over #2 seed Arizona, after having defeated #4 seed North Carolina 79\u201372. In the Final Four, they topped previously unbeaten overall #1 seed Kentucky 71\u201364, ending their undefeated season. They lost to Duke in the championship game, 68\u201363.\nMidway through the 2015\u201316 season, Ryan opted to retire immediately after earlier saying that this season would be his last.\n\nGreg Gard era (2015\u2013present)\nGreg Gard, who had been on Ryan's staff since his days at UW-Platteville, was named interim head coach in December 2015.\nIn the 2015\u201316 season, the Badgers entered the NCAA tournament as a 7 seed. The Badgers beat 10 seed Pittsburgh in the first round 47\u201343 to advance to face 2 seed Xavier in the second round. The Badgers locked up their second victory defeating Xavier 66\u201363 with a buzzer beater from Bronson Koenig. They were then defeated in the sweet sixteen by 6 seed Notre Dame, 61\u201356. Earlier, Wisconsin had dropped the interim tag from Gard's title and named him head coach.\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, the Badgers were second in the regular-season Big Ten standings and in the Big Ten Conference tournament. They entered the NCAA tournament as an 8 seed. They defeated 9 seed Virginia Tech in the first round 84\u201374, moving on to face overall 1 seed Villanova at Buffalo. They defeated Villanova 65\u201362 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the fourth straight year, only to lose 84\u201383 to 4 seed Florida on a last-second buzzer beater in overtime by Chris Chiozza.\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, the Badgers finished the season with a 15\u201318 record, 7\u201311 in Big Ten Play and finished in 9th place. They defeated Maryland in the second round of the Big Ten tournament, followed by a loss to Michigan State in the quarterfinals.

After winning 8 straight games to end the regular season, Wisconsin secured a share of the Big Ten regular season title, and was named the #1 seed in the Big Ten tournament. Coach Gard would also be named the Big Ten Coach of the Year. However, the Badgers' season would end early as the Big Ten tournament and NCAA Tournament were both cancelled due to precautions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

    "biography": "The Wofford Terriers men's basketball team represents Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States, in Division I of the NCAA. The school's team competes in the Southern Conference. Wofford is currently coached by Kevin Giltner, who was hired after previous head coach Dwight Perry was let go in September 2025. Wofford plays its home games at Jerry Richardson Indoor Stadium, opened for the 2017\u201318 season as the replacement for Benjamin Johnson Arena. The Terriers have appeared six times in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, most recently in 2025.\n\nHistory\nThe Terriers have been playing Division I basketball in the Southern Conference since the 1997\u201398 season. They have won four regular season SoCon titles and five SoCon tournament championships and are one-time SoCon tournament runner-ups. The Terriers currently hold a 1\u20135 record in the NCAA tournament. Wofford has defeated various high major opponents during their 31 years in NCAA Division I. They have beaten North Carolina twice, South Carolina twice, Georgia twice, Clemson, Georgia Tech, NC State, Seton Hall, Purdue, Tulane, Wake Forest, Texas A&M, Cincinnati, Auburn, Virginia Tech, Air Force, George Mason, and Xavier since joining Division I for the 1995\u201396 season.\nOn March 8, 2010, the Terriers defeated Appalachian State to win the Southern Conference tournament, marking the first time Wofford qualified for the NCAA tournament. Although Wofford came within a possession of upsetting 4th seeded Wisconsin in the first round, they eventually lost, 49\u201353. The Terriers qualified for the NCAA tournament for the second time on March 7, 2011, winning the Southern Conference tournament over College of Charleston, 77\u201367, but they lost in the first round to BYU. Brad Loesing, point guard and 4.0 Phi Beta Kappa student, was selected first team Division I Academic All-American. In 2013, Wofford won the Southern Conference tournament and qualified for the NCAA tournament for the third time in five years, losing to Michigan in the second round. Wofford also won a spot in the 2015 NCAA tourney, going 28\u20136. In February 2016, Wofford set an NCAA record when it hit 17 of 21 shots from the three-point line against VMI. For the 2017 season, a new state-of-the-art basketball and volleyball arena, Jerry Richardson Indoor Stadium, opened on the Wofford campus. In the 2017\u201318 season, Wofford defeated the defending national champion North Carolina in Chapel Hill, the first Wofford win against a ranked opponent and the first win against a top 5 opponent in school history.\nDuring the 2018\u201319 season, Wofford was nationally ranked for the first time in school history. The Terriers finished with a 30\u20135 record and 18\u20130 in the Southern Conference, the first undefeated SoCon season in the modern era. As a 7-seed in the NCAA tournament, they defeated 10th-seeded Seton Hall, 84\u201368, in the first round, and during the game, Wofford star shooting guard Fletcher Magee broke the all-time NCAA career record for three-pointers made. They went on to lose to Kentucky, 62\u201356, in the second round in a contest that garnered the second highest ratings of any game during the round of 32. \n\nFletcher went on to win the 2019 Lou Henson Award, an award given annually by CollegeInsider.com to the most outstanding mid-major men's college basketball player in NCAA Division I competition. They spent the final five weeks in the AP top 25 poll, finishing at no. 19 in the final poll. Following the season, legendary Wofford basketball coach Mike Young was hired as the new head coach at Virginia Tech, with Jay McAuley taking over as Wofford head coach.\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, Wofford beat 17th ranked North Carolina in Chapel Hill for the second time in three years. They finished seventh in the Southern Conference during the regular season, but made a run in the Southern Conference tourney, appearing in their second straight SoCon title game, but losing to ETSU. The following season, 2020\u201321, was significantly shortened due to COVID-19, and no fans were allowed to attend games. Wofford finished second in the SoCon during the regular season, a half game back of UNCG. This sparked controversy as Wofford held a head-to-head advantage over UNCG, and Wofford was not allowed to make-up a game with Samford which had been postponed and later cancelled. As a 2-seed in the SoCon tournament, Wofford was upset by 7th-seed Mercer, losing, 62\u201361.\n\nNCAA Division I history\nAfter two years as a Division I independent, Wofford joined the Southern Conference for the 1997\u201398 season.\n\n^A.  After initially accepting a bid to play in the 2022 The Basketball Classic, Wofford ultimately withdrew, ahead of their game against Youngstown State.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA Division I tournament results\nThe Terriers have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament six times. Their combined record is 1\u20135.\n\nCBI results\nThe Terriers have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time.

Mike Zink. Paul Brown, and Gary Webb. Jim Thacker was named the MVP and Chuck Horton, Mark Donahue and John Hildebrand took the foul shooting honors. In 1983, Wright State won the Division II NCAA tournament. Wright State moved to Division I in 1987, and have made NCAA tournament appearances in 1993, 2007, 2018, and 2022.\n\nMarcus Jackson era (1975\u20131978)\nMarcus Jackson took over for John Ross in 1975 and led the Raiders to its first 20-win season and first NCAA tournament appearance.  \nJackson had joined Wright State following highly regarded seasons at Coe College and Dartmouth College.   His philosophy was up-tempo and high-scoring:  \"Basketball is a spectator sport and we aim to entertain the people . . . We will not be robots on the basketball court. We intend to make WSU basketball an exciting sport for all concerned and form a lasting impression on our fans.\"\nAfter taking some lumps as a young team in 1976\u201377, by 1977\u201378 Jackson had his Raiders running hot again, but a losing streak at the end of the season and arguments with the athletic administration brought his tenure to an early end.  Jackson's legacy at Wright State was laying a solid foundation that helped to launch the high-flying basketball years that followed.\n\nRalph Underhill era (1978\u20131996)\nRalph Underhill was the most successful coach in Wright State history, with a career total of 356 wins, including leading the team to an NCAA Division II National Championship in the 1982\u201383 season.\nIn 1999\u20132000 Israel Sheinfeld playing for the Raiders led the Midwestern Collegiate Conference in field goal percentage, at .543, and in rebounds per game, at 7.7. He was named to the 2000 All-MCC first team. In 2000\u20132001 he led the conference in two-point field goal percentage, at .595.\n\nPaul Biancardi era (2003\u20132005)\nOn April 8, 2003, Wright State announced that Paul Biancardi would be the new head coach. Before coaching Wright State, Biancardi was an assistant at St. Louis, Boston College and Ohio State where he coached under Jim O'Brien. Recognized nationally, Biancardi was named the No. 1 assistant coach in the country by Hoop Scoop Online. In his first season as coach, Wright State finished with a 14\u201314 record and finished 5th in the Horizon League Standings with a 10\u20136 conference record and lost to Loyola (IL) in the first round of the conference tournament. In the 2004\u20132005 season Wright State would finish with a 15\u201315 while finishing 6th in the conference standings with an 8\u20138 record. During the Horizon League tournament the Raiders would beat Butler in the first round but lost to Detroit in the second round. In 2005\u20132006, Wright State's final record was 13\u201315, with an 8\u20138 conference record they would finish 7th in the standings. The Raiders would once again have an early exit from the Horizon League tournament, losing to UIC in the first round. Despite never having a winning season in the three seasons that Biancardi coached at Wright State, it was his recruiting classes that would set the Raiders up for success in the future. Wright State and Biancardi agreed to part after the NCAA barred him from recruiting for violating rules while he was an assistant at Ohio State. Biancardi's final record at Wright State was 42\u201344.\n\nBrad Brownell era (2006\u20132009)\nBrad Brownell left his position with UNC Wilmington to take over the head coaching duties at Wright State beginning in the 2006\u20132007 basketball season. In his first season, Wright State was the regular season Horizon League Champion, going 23\u201310 overall, and 13\u20133 in conference play. Their 3 losses were at Youngstown State, at Butler, and at Milwaukee. In an impressive season, Wright State only lost one home game all season, that was a 3-point loss to Bowling Green. In the Horizon League Championship game, Wright State edged Butler 60\u201355 at the Nutter Center, and secured an automatic bid in the NCAA tournament. They eventually earned a 14 seed, and lost in the first round to the Pittsburgh Panthers.\nThe next three seasons were not as successful for Brownell as his first. Wright State finished 3rd, 3rd, and 2nd respectfully over the 2007, 2008, and 2009 seasons. However, Brad did lead Wright State to 20-win seasons in each of his four years with the program. After the conclusion of the 2009\u20132010 season, Brad Brownell left Wright State to take the head coaching job at Clemson University.\nBrownell finished his coaching at Wright State officially 84\u201345 and 49\u201321 in conference play in 4 completed seasons. More impressively, Brownell finished 58\u201310 in home contests over his 4-year tenure.\n\nBilly Donlon era (2010\u20132016)\nBilly Donlon took over the Wright State Men's Basketball program in 2010 after the announcement that Brad Brownell would be leaving for Clemson. In the 2012\u20132013 season, after being projected to finish last in the league, Wright State finished 3rd in the Horizon League, and earned a first round bye in the Horizon League tournament. Wright State would beat Youngstown State in the second round of the tournament to advance to the conference semi-finals where they would play the defending Horizon League tournament champion Detroit. Miles Dixon hit a baseline jumper from behind the backboard as time expired, lifting Wright State into the Horizon League tournament championship game for the first time since the 2009\u20132010 season. The team went on to lose to Valparaiso in the Horizon League Championship game by 6 points. Wright State was invited to the College Basketball Invitational where they would make it to the semi-finals before losing to eventual tournament champion Tulsa. Billy Donlon also earned the Horizon League Coach of the Year award for Wright State's performance in the 2012\u20132013 season.\nOver his six seasons he accumulated an overall record 109\u201394 vs DI and non DI competition.\n\nScott Nagy era (2016\u20132024)\nFollowing the firing of Billy Donlon after the 2015\u20132016 season, Wright State hired then South Dakota State University head coach Scott Nagy to head their program. He was the highest paid coach in Raider history with an annual salary of $500k. In Nagy's first season the Raiders went 20\u201312 and 11\u20137 in league. The Raiders lost to NKU in the 4/5 match-up in the Horizon League Tournament. The Raiders chose not to participate in postseason play.\nIn his second season, Nagy's Raiders finished second in the Horizon League regular season (even though they swept #1 seed NKU) with a conference record of 14\u20134. The Raiders won the Horizon League Tournament and clinched their first NCAA tournament berth since 2007.\nHis Raiders teams continued to set the standard in the Horizon League reeling off 20 win seasons and returning to the NCAA tournament in 2022.  However, his final two seasons were marked by inconsistent play, poor defense and multiple player defections.  The frustration seemed to mount with each passing week, culminating with Nagy leaving for the head coaching job at Southern Illinois.\n\nRetired numbers\nWright State has retired one jersey number in its history.\n\nFacilities\nThe Wright State Raiders currently play their home games at the Ervin J. Nutter Center. Ervin J. Nutter, donated $1.5 million to Wright State University in 1986. Funds from both the state of Ohio and the university contributed an additional $8 million to construction efforts which began in 1988. Completed in 1990, Wright State would host the first event on December 1 where they would defeat Tennessee State 88\u201366.\n\nCoaches\nThe Raiders have had 10 coaches. Current head coach Clint Sargent was hired in 2024.  Scott Nagy was the head coach from 2016 to 2024. Billy Donlon was the head coach from 2010 to 2016 after Brad Brownell was announced as the new Clemson head coach. Brownell was the second coach to take Wright State to the NCAA tournament following the winningest coach in team history, Ralph Underhill. Underhill coached from 1978 to 1996 and accumulated 356 wins at Wright State and an NCAA DII national championship in the 1982\u201383 season.\n\nCurrent coaching staff\nSource\n\nSeason-by-season records\nWSU's records season by season during their Division II tenure.\n\nWSU's records season by season since joining Division I in 1987.\n\nNotes\n\nRecord vs. Horizon League opponents\nRivalries\nDayton\nThe Wright State University and University of Dayton series is known as the Gem City Jam. The two universities are located in Dayton, Ohio, only 10 miles apart from each other. Although the two schools no longer compete head to head in men's basketball, they still compete against each other in other sports. The series currently favors Dayton at 5\u20133. The last meeting was held at the University of Dayton on December 13, 1997; Dayton won 94\u201363.\n\nNorthern Kentucky\nThe Wright State and Northern Kentucky series began in 1972 where both schools would routinely compete against each other up until 1987 when Wright State moved to division 1.

  "Wyoming Cowboys": {
    "biography": "The University of Wyoming men's basketball program, which competes in the Mountain West Conference, with the schools first recorded game dating back to 1905. Wyoming won the 1943 NCAA championship under Hall of Fame coach Everett Shelton and behind star guard Ken Sailors, who pioneered the jump shot that is now the standard in basketball. Wyoming has made a total of 16 appearances in the NCAA tournament. Since the Mountain West was formed in 1999, Wyoming has won two conference titles, including an outright championship in 2002. Prior to that, Wyoming won five championships in the Western Athletic Conference, eight championships in the Skyline Conference, and one championship in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference.\n\nHistory\nThe Wyoming basketball program began in 1904 when a group known as the \"Laramie Town Team\" challenged a team from the university to a basketball game; Wyoming won that game by a score of 17\u20135. The team became a powerhouse in the 1930s under coach Willard \"Dutch\" Witte, who led the 1934 Cowboy team to a 26\u20133 record. Wyoming was retroactively named the 1934 national champion by the Helms Foundation. Witte coached a total of nine seasons in Laramie and compiled a 134\u201351 record.\nAfter Witte stepped down in 1939, Everett Shelton took over the team and went on to become the winningest coach in Wyoming history in his 19 years in Laramie. Although Shelton went just 6\u201310 in his first season, his teams would win 20 or more games seven times during his career. In 1943, the Cowboys went 31\u20132 and won the NCAA tournament. That team was led by Ken Sailors, who scored 16 points in the championship game victory over Georgetown on his way to being named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. In addition, Sailors was named college basketball's Player of the Year in 1943 and again in 1946 after returning from fighting in World War II. In all, the Cowboys made eight NCAA tournament appearances under Shelton, though they only won one game aside from the three-game run in 1943.\nAfter Shelton retired in 1959, Wyoming basketball lay dormant for some time. Including Shelton's last four campaigns as head coach, the Cowboys endured nine consecutive losing seasons from 1956 to 1964. Coach Bill Strannigan, who succeeded Shelton, had just six winning seasons in 14 years as head coach and made one NCAA Tournament appearance in 1967 in which the Cowboys were handed a lopsided loss at the hands of eventual national champion UCLA and its All-American center Lew Alcindor, who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Again from 1971 through 1978, the Cowboys had one winning season, a 17\u201310 campaign under Don DeVoe in 1976\u201377.\nIn 1978, Jim Brandenburg became the Cowboys' head coach and the program experienced a resurgence. In his nine seasons, Wyoming did not have a single losing season and made four NCAA Tournament appearances. In 1981, the Cowboys were 24\u20136 and reached the second round of the NCAA tournament. In addition to being the Cowboys' first tournament appearance since 1967, it was their first 20-win season since 1952\u201353 and first NCAA tournament victory since 1952. After guiding the Cowboys to the Sweet 16 in 1987, however, Brandenburg left the Cowboys to become the coach at conference rival San Diego State. He was replaced by Benny Dees, who went 26\u20136 in his first year with the Cowboys and returned them to the NCAA tournament in 1988 where they lost in the first round to Loyola Marymount.\nLarry Shyatt went 19\u20139 in 1997\u201398, his only season in Laramie before becoming the head coach at Clemson University. After his departure, Steve McClain took over the head coaching job and had three consecutive 20-win seasons from 2001 to 2003, including conference titles in 2001 and 2002 and an NCAA tournament appearance in 2002. On March 22, 2007, Wyoming hired former Portland State head coach Heath Schroyer to become its next head coach. Shyatt was hired yet again as Wyoming's head coach after the 2010\u201311 season ended due to the firing of Heath Schroyer. The 2010\u201311 team's top two scorers left the program afterwards, with Desmar Jackson and Amath M'Baye transferring to Southern Illinois University and the University of Oklahoma, respectively.\nThe Cowboys went 21\u201312 in Shyatt's first season, for their first 20\u2013win season in 9 years. They made the College Basketball Invitational each of the next three seasons, making the quarterfinals in 2012 and 2013. In the 2014\u201315 season, the Cowboys finished with a record of 25\u201310, won the Mountain West Conference tournament over San Diego State 45\u201343, and earned an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Larry Nance Jr. was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers with the 27th pick in the 2015 NBA draft, becoming Wyoming's first player selected in the draft since Theo Ratliff in 1995. On March 21, 2016, Shyatt announced his resignation from the head coaching job, and Allen Edwards was announced as the 21st head coach in program history.\nIn Edwards' first season, the Cowboys went 23\u201315 and won the CBI tournament, defeating Coastal Carolina in the championship. Edwards again won 20 games in his second season. In 2019, Justin James was drafted 40th overall by the Sacramento Kings, becoming the second Cowboy in the decade to be taken in the NBA draft. On December 9, 2019, the program retired Fennis Dembo's no. 34 jersey. Following two disappointing campaigns where the Cowboys failed to win 10 games each year, Edwards was let go as head coach. Jeff Linder was hired as the 22nd head coach in program history on March 17, 2020.\nIn Linder's first season with the Cowboys, he led the team to a 14\u201311 year despite inheriting a team with only 6 conference wins the two seasons prior. This included a 6\u20131 non-conference record highlighted by a road win against eventual Elite Eight participant Oregon State. The team's season ended in the Mountain West tournament quarterfinals 69\u201366 to eventual champion San Diego State.\n\nHead coaching records\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Cowboys have appeared in the NCAA tournament 16 times, with a combined record of 9\u201321.

The Cowboys moved into War Memorial Fieldhouse in 1951 and remained there until the Arena-Auditorium opened in 1982.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

  "Xavier Musketeers": {
    "biography": "The Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team represents Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. The school's team currently competes in the Big East Conference. Xavier has appeared in the NCAA tournament 30 times, 16 times in the 18 tournaments between 2001 and 2018. On March 11, 2018, Xavier earned its first ever No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Xavier is also a two-time winner of the NIT, with their most recent championship coming in 2022.\nXavier won four Atlantic 10 tournament championships (1998, 2002, 2004 and 2006). Xavier has won or shared 17 regular season conference championships, while winning 9 conference tournament championships. In addition, they have won one Big East Conference regular season title in 2018. They made the 2023 Big East Championship but lost to the Marquette Golden Eagles.\nXavier has been listed among the top-20 most valuable college basketball teams.\n\nHistory\nThe first Xavier basketball game on record was February 20, 1920 at the Fenwick Club in Cincinnati. Coached by Joe Meyer, the Musketeers compiled a 94\u201352 record during Meyer's 13-year run as head coach from 1920 to 1933. The Musketeer's success continued under second head coach Clem Crowe. During Crowe's 10 years as Xavier head coach, Xavier compiled a record of 96\u201378. Crowe's 96 wins as a head coach rank fourth all-time among Xavier head coaches.\nFollowing the 1942\u201343 season, play was suspended for the following two seasons because of World War II. In 1945, the program resumed under the leadership of head coach Ed Burns. In his one season as head coach, Burns compiled a record of 3\u201316.\nIn 1946, Burns was replaced by Lew Hirt. Under Hirt, the Musketeers first postseason appearance was in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) during the 1948 NAIA National Basketball tournament, the national tournament for small colleges. Xavier finished in 4th place, losing to Hamline University in the national third-place game, 58\u201359. 1948 was the only year Xavier appeared in the NAIA tournament.\nIn 1951, Hirt was replaced as head coach by Ned Wulk. Wulk guided the Musketeers to National Invitational Tournament appearances in 1956 and 1957. The 1956 appearance marked Xavier's first NIT win, an 84\u201380 victory over Saint Louis.\nAfter a loss to Bradley in the 1957 NIT, Wulk was replaced as head coach by Jim McCafferty. McCafferty led the Musketeers back to a third straight NIT in 1958. With wins over Niagara, Bradley, St. Bonaventure and Dayton, Xavier captured the NIT. According to most college basketball historians, the NIT was the elite post season tournament until the NCAA overtook it in the early 1960s. That was the first postseason championship won by any Ohio Division I school.\nIn 1961, McCafferty led Xavier to their first appearance in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. On March 14, 1961, Xavier fell to Morehead State at the Kentucky State Fairgrounds in Louisville, Kentucky.\nMcCafferty was replaced as head coach in 1963. He would be followed by Don Ruberg (1963\u201367), George Krajack (1967\u201371), Dick Campbell (1971\u201373) and Tay Baker (1973\u201379).\nIn 1979, Xavier was one of the charter members of the Midwestern City Conference (nicknamed the MCC or Midwestern City 6, and now known as the Horizon League), which also included Butler, Evansville, Loyola (Chicago), Oklahoma City, and Oral Roberts. That year also marked the hiring of head coach Bob Staak, who compiled an 88\u201386 record during his six seasons as head coach, including a return to both the NCAA Tournament and NIT.\n\nPete Gillen era\n1985 once again marked considerable change for the program. In addition to the hiring of head coach Pete Gillen, the Midwestern City Conference altered its name slightly to the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, adding more teams including Detroit, Notre Dame (excluding men's basketball and football), Saint Louis, Marquette and Dayton. The MCC is the predecessor to the present-day Horizon League. Xavier was a member of the MCC from 1979 to 1995 and won eight regular season and six conference tournament championships.\nFrom 1985 to 1994, Gillen compiled a 202\u201375 record, including the program's first five wins in the NCAA Tournament. The Musketeers advanced to the NCAA Tournament in seven of Gillen's nine years at the helm. In 1990, Xavier beat Kansas State and future Big East colleagues Georgetown to advance to the program's first Sweet Sixteen.\n\nSkip Prosser era\nSkip Prosser was hired in the spring of 1994 to replace departed head coach Pete Gillen. In his seven seasons as head coach, Prosser compiled a 148\u201365 record with four NCAA tournament appearances. Prosser's 148 wins are third all-time at Xavier. During his time at Xavier, Prosser continued to build on the momentum Gillen had created. Early in his tenure, Prosser added recruits Gary Lumpkin, Darnell Williams, Lenny Brown and James Posey. Those four players provided the core of Prosser's success during his time at Xavier. After missing the NCAA Tournament in both 1999 and 2000, Xavier returned to the tournament in 2001. Following a loss to Notre Dame in the tournament's first round, Prosser accepted the position of head coach at Wake Forest.\n\nThad Matta era\nThad Matta left alma mater Butler to replace Skip Prosser as Xavier's head coach in 2001. Hired with only one year of head coaching experience, Matta inherited a talented core of players in David West, Lionel Chalmers, and Romain Sato. During his three years at the helm, Matta compiled a record of 78\u201323, with three straight NCAA tournament appearances and Xavier's first appearance in the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight. Matta won two Atlantic 10 regular-season championships in his first two years behind the play of National Player of the Year David West. Following Matta's second year, West was drafted in the first round of the 2003 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets. With West's departure, seniors Lionel Chalmers, Romain Sato and Anthony Myles became the team's cornerstone for the 2003\u201304 season. After a 10\u20139 start, Xavier closed the season by winning 16 of its last 18 games. \"The Run\", as it became known, left Xavier 3 points shy of making the program's first NCAA Final Four appearance.\n\nSean Miller era\nThe summer following Xavier's first Elite Eight appearance, Matta was offered and accepted the position of head men's basketball coach at Ohio State. Xavier Athletic Director, Dawn Rogers, quickly promoted Xavier Associate Head Coach Sean Miller. From 2004 to 2009, Miller compiled a record of 120\u201347. Advancing to the NCAA Tournament in four of his five seasons as head coach, Miller led the Musketeers to another Elite Eight appearance in 2008 and a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2009. During Miller's tenure as head coach, Xavier continued to shed the \"mid-major\" label and separate itself as one of the country's premier college basketball programs. Miller's NCAA Tournament success, aggressive non-conference scheduling and national recruiting allowed Xavier to be recognized with the likes of Memphis and Gonzaga as one of the premier basketball programs. After turning away interest from many programs, Sean Miller left Xavier to become the head basketball coach at Arizona.\n\nChris Mack era\nOn April 15, 2009, Xavier's Athletic Director named Xavier Assistant Coach Chris Mack as the 17th head basketball coach in the program's history. A Cincinnati native and Xavier graduate, Mack compiled a record of 26\u20139 in his first year as head coach. Behind the play of 2010 NBA draft pick Jordan Crawford, Xavier advanced to the NCAA Tournament's Sweet Sixteen for a third straight season. Chris Mack, the 2009\u201310 Basketball Times Rookie Coach of the Year, was the first Xavier head coach to lead the Musketeers to the Sweet Sixteen in his first season at the helm. With a 14\u20132 record in Atlantic 10 play, Xavier also won a share of their fourth straight conference championship.\nFinishing with a 24\u20138 overall record including a 15\u20131 record in the A-10, Mack lead the Musketeers to a fifth consecutive A-10 title and another NCAA tournament berth in 2010\u201311.\nIn a 2011\u201312 season filled with highs and lows. The early season was marred by the Crosstown Shootout brawl in their yearly rivalry game against Cincinnati. The Musketeers had reached as high as #8 in the AP Poll before numerous suspensions from the Crosstown Shootout brawl lead to the team losing 5 of their next 6 games. Xavier rebounded from this ugly incident and reached Mack's second Sweet Sixteen.\nIn 2013, Xavier joined the newly reconstituted Big East Conference following Big East conference realignment. Xavier became one of the new members of the new 10-team Big East with the \"Catholic 7\" (DePaul, Georgetown, Marquette, Providence, Seton Hall, St. John's, and Villanova) plus Butler and Creighton. Xavier finished their first season in the Big East with a record of 21\u201313, 10\u20138 to finish Big East play in a tie for third place. They received a bid to the NCAA tournament, but lost in the First Round (First Four).\nThe 2014\u201315 season also saw a return to the Sweet Sixteen for the Musketeers. From 2008 to 2015, Xavier made five Sweet Sixteens, tied for third in the nation with Wisconsin over that span behind only Louisville and Michigan State. The 2015\u201316 team finished second in the Big East to Villanova, Xavier's highest finish in the Big East, and advanced to the Second Round of the NCAA tournament.\nIn 2017, Mack led Xavier to a 24\u201314 season and got the 11th seed in the West and advanced to the Elite Eight by defeating 6th seed Maryland, 3rd seed Florida State, and 2nd seed Arizona. In the Elite Eight they lost to Gonzaga.\nMack's 215 wins concluding the 2017\u201318 season placed him first in all-time wins in Xavier history.\n\nTravis Steele era\nOn March 27, 2018, Mack was named the head coach at the University of Louisville. Four days after Mack left Xavier for Louisville, longtime Xavier assistant coach Travis Steele was named head coach of the Musketeers. Despite success against rival Cincinnati, Steele was criticized for his inability to lead the Musketeers to the NCAA tournament. After missing the tournament for the fourth consecutive year, Steele was fired on March 16, 2022.\n\nSecond Sean Miller era\nOnly three days after the firing of Travis Steele, Xavier hired former head coach Sean Miller as his replacement. During the period in between Steele\u2019s exit and Miller\u2019s full installation as head coach Jonas Hayes served as interim. Hayes would lead the Musketeers to their second-ever NIT championship.\nIn his first season back at Xavier, Miller led the team to a 27-10 record, earning a berth in the NCAA tournament as a no. 3 seed, where they would be eliminated in the Sweet 16 by Texas. The Musketeers struggled in Miller's second year back, posting a 16-18 record, which broke the team's long streak of winning seasons. Xavier would return to national prominence in the 2024-25 season, however, finishing with a 21-10 regular-season record. The team reached the NCAA Tournament as a no. 11 seed, led by the resurgent All-Conference forward Zach Freemantle, who had been injured for the entirety of the previous year. Xavier defeated Texas in the First Four in Dayton, 86-80, before losing in the NCAA first round to no. 6 seed Illinois, 86-73, in Milwaukee.\nOn March 23, 2025 it was reported that Miller would be leaving Xavier to become the next head coach at the University of Texas. Miller's second departure was met with widespread outrage from Xavier fans, as Miller had previously expressed regret at having left Xavier in 2009.\n\nRichard Pitino era\nOn March 26, 2025 Xavier announced that Richard Pitino would become their next head basketball coach.\n\nHome courts\nCintas Center\nXavier currently plays its home games at the Cintas Center, a 10,212 seat multi-purpose arena that opened in 2000. The Cintas Center is the fifth different home site in program history.\nAt Cintas Center, Xavier enjoys one of the nation's best home court advantages. As of April 2018 the Musketeers have compiled a 258\u201341 (an .863 winning percentage) record since moving to its on-campus home in 2000. Xavier enjoyed a 15\u20130 mark at home during the 2009\u201310, its only perfect record for a season at Cintas Center. During the 2017\u20132018 season, the Musketeers set a Cintas Center record with 17 home victories. The building was named the #3 \"Toughest Place to Play\" on EA Sports' NCAA Basketball '10. In August 2018 the NCAA named it as the 8th toughest home court in college basketball.\nThrough the 2018\u20132019 season, Cintas Center has hosted 3,011,308 fans for Xavier home games and the Musketeers have averaged 10,071 fans (better than 98% capacity) per game during that time. The 2017\u20132018 season marked the highest average attendance in Cintas Center history with an average 10,475 (over 102% capacity) Musketeer fans at each home game.\n\nCincinnati Gardens\nThe Musketeers played their final season at Cincinnati Gardens in 1999\u20132000. Located two miles from the Xavier campus, the Gardens was the home court for the Xavier Musketeers since the 1983\u201384 season.\nThe Xavier men's team played all of its regular season games off campus at the Cincinnati Gardens for 17 years, beginning with the 1983\u201384 season and ending with an NIT game against Marquette in the 1999\u20132000 season. The only exception was a game against Florida International that was played at Schmidt Fieldhouse on January 9, 1988.\nXavier compiled an impressive 215\u201325 (.896) record after moving to the Gardens in the 1983\u201384 season, including 14\u20131 in its final season.\n\nSchmidt Fieldhouse\nPrior to moving to the Cincinnati Gardens in the 1983\u201384 season, Xavier called Schmidt Fieldhouse home. Located on the west side of the Xavier Campus, Xavier compiled an impressive 326\u2013129 (.716) record at the Fieldhouse.\nUntil opening Cintas Center, the men's basketball team had only played one regular season game on campus since early in the 1983\u201384 season. Xavier scored a school-record point total in a 125\u201384 win over Florida International on Saturday, January 9, 1988.\n\nOther home courts\nThe Musketeers have also used Riverfront Coliseum and the Fenwick Club.\n\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Musketeers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 30 times. Their combined record is 31\u201330.\n\n*Following the introduction of the \"First Four\" round in 2011, the Round of 64 and Round of 32 were referred to as the Second Round and Third Round, respectively, from 2011 to 2015. Then from 2016 forward, the Round of 64 and Round of 32 are called the First and Second Rounds, as they were prior to 2011.\n\nNCAA Tournament seeding history\nThe NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\n\nNIT results\nThe Musketeers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) ten times. Their combined record is 21\u20138. They were NIT Champions in 1958 and 2022.\n\nNAIA tournament results\nThe Musketeers have appeared in the NAIA tournament one time. Their record is 3\u20132.\n\nMusketeers in the NBA\nThe following table shows Xavier players selected in the NBA or ABA draft or appearing on an NBA or ABA roster.\n\nMusketeers overseas\nAs of March 21, 2024, 24 former Xavier players are currently playing professionally overseas.\n\nRomain Sato, 2010 Italian League MVP, won two straight Italian League Championships in 2009 and 2010. More recently, Justin Doellman was named ACB MVP in 2014 while with Valencia. Mark Lyons was the top scorer in the Israel Basketball Premier League in both 2015 and 2017. Zach Hankins plays for Hapoel Jerusalem of the Israeli Basketball Premier League.\n\nAwards\nAll-Americans\nXavier has a total of 20 players who have won All-American honors during their careers with the program.\n\nConference Player of the Year\nRetired numbers\nXavier has retired jersey numbers for seven players in their history.\n\nFormer university President Fr. James Hoff has also had a \"jersey\" retired in memory of all that he contributed to the school and basketball program. This was unveiled before a 2004 meeting with Creighton, where Hoff was vice president of university relations and President of the Creighton Foundation. Fr. Hoff died from cancer in 2004.\n\nCoaching history\nChart Data\n\nBasketball and academics\nNCAA academic progress rate\nIn May 2010, the NCAA honored a school-record tying eight Xavier University athletic programs with Public Recognition Awards for academic excellence. The award is given to the top-ten percent of teams in each sport based on the NCAA Academic Progress Rate. The APR is a term-by-term progress for every student-athlete in Division I athletics. Out of the 65 teams to make the 2010 NCAA tournament Xavier had the 11th highest Academic Progress Rate.\n\nGraduation\nSince 1986, Xavier has graduated every men's basketball player that has exhausted his eligibility.\n\nSister Rose Ann Fleming\nDuring the 2010 NCAA tournament Xavier's Academic Advisor Sister Rose Ann Fleming garnered considerable national attention for the role she has played in the program's academic success. Fleming was featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and on both ABC's Good Morning America and NBC Nightly News. Fleming has over 40 years of experience as an educator. She was president of Cincinnati's Summit Country Day School from 1975 to 1976 and president of Trinity College in Washington, D.C. from 1976 to 1982.\nIn addition to the national recognition she received during the 2010 NCAA tournament she has also been featured in Reader's Digest, Woman's Day, was voted one of the Cincinnati Enquirer's Women of the Year, and was the subject of a promotional spot on The Family Channel.\n\nRivalries\nCrosstown Shootout\nXavier's main rival is the University of Cincinnati. The two schools play annually in the Skyline Chili Crosstown Shootout. Xavier's record in the Shootout is 40\u201352.\n\nOther rivals\nXavier and Dayton play for the Blackburn/McCafferty Trophy, named for former coaches at the respective universities. Dayton has not beaten Xavier in Cincinnati since 1981. Dayton maintains a lead in the overall series 85\u201376. However, Xavier won nine straight games against Dayton between March 1991 and December 1994, and went 24\u20138 between the 2001\u201302 and 2015\u201316 seasons.\nXavier also maintains a heated rivalry with Butler, with the Musketeers leading the overall series, 44\u201324. Xavier won four of the six games between the teams during the 2020\u201321 and 2021\u201322 seasons, sweeping the four regular-season matchups and losing each year to Butler in the Big East tournament.\nBetween the 2009\u201310 and 2024-25 seasons, Xavier played Wake Forest eight times in a series known as the Skip Prosser Classic, named for the former coach of both schools.

    "biography": "The Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team represents Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, competing in the Ivy League. The team plays home games in the John J. Lee Amphitheater of the Payne Whitney Gymnasium. The team has reached the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament eight times; in 1949, 1957, 1962, 2016, 2019, 2022, 2024, and 2025. The current head coach is James Jones.\n\nHistory\nYale has been named national champion on six occasions \u2013 in 1896, 1897, 1899, and 1900 by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll, which started to retroactive selections with the 1895\u201396 season; and in 1901 and 1903 by the Helms Athletic Foundation, which began retroactive selections with the 1900\u201301 season.\nPenn and Yale played in the first college basketball game with five men on a team in 1897.\n\nIn 1969\u2014against the wishes of the NCAA\u2014Yale Jewish center Jack Langer played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel. He did so with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster. The university said it would not stop him from \"what we feel is a matter of religious freedom,\" and all Ivy League presidents fully endorsed Yale's stand. After that, Yale played Langer in basketball games the following season. A special assistant to the President of Yale, Henry Chauncey, Jr., said: \"There is no question that Jack Langer will continue to play basketball. We don't care what they do - Jack Langer will play when the coach wants to use him.\" On January 15, 1970, the NCAA Council placed Yale University on two\u2010year \"full athletic probation\" in all sports. It thereby restricted Yale teams and athletes (not just basketball players) for two years from competing in NCAA tournaments, championships and other postseason competitions and from receiving any monies for televised events. The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years.\nThe Presidents of the other seven Ivy League schools issued a statement condemning the NCAA's actions regarding the \"Langer Case.\" The Harvard Crimson called the probation \"unjust but intolerable,\" and urged the Ivy League to withdraw from the NCAA.  Harvard track and field captain Ed Nosal and two other Harvard athletes, sympathetic to Langer and Yale and disdainful of the absurdity of the NCAA rule, protested at the 1970 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships by standing on the awards stand wearing blue Yale jerseys. In February 1970, Representative Robert N. Giaimo (D-Connecticut) said in the U.S. Congress:\n\nThe Yale case, involving basketball player Jack Langer, is tragic. It shows that the NCAA is willing to use any weapon in its continuing power struggle with the Amateur Athletic Union. It shows that the NCAA does not care if it hurts member institutions or individual athletes in the process. It shows once again that the NCAA is ... under the control of a stubborn, dictatorial hierarchy that does not hesitate to use athletes and schools alike as mere pawns in a game of power politics.\nIn 1986-87, Chris Dudley led the Ivy League with 13.3 rebounds per game and 2.8 blocks per game. \n\nYale has won seven Ivy League championships \u2013 1957, 1962, 1963, 2002, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2024, and 2025. It also won the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League, the forerunner to the Ivy League, eight times \u2013 1902, 1903, 1907, 1915, 1917, 1923, 1933 and 1949. The Bulldogs captured the first official Ivy League title in 1957, finishing 12\u20132 and losing to eventual national champion North Carolina, 90\u201374, in the NCAA East Regional. The 1962 club finished 13\u20131 in Ivy play but lost overtime to Wake Forest, 92\u201382, in the East Regional. The 1963 team tied Princeton for the Ivy title with an 11\u20133 record but fell to the Tigers in a playoff, 65\u201353. In 2002, the Bulldogs were part of the first three-way tie in Ivy history. \nYale beat Princeton 76\u201360 in the first Ivy playoff game but fell to Penn 77\u201358 to determine the NCAA berth. In 2015, Yale tied Harvard for the Ivy title with an 11\u20133 record, with a playoff between the two to determine the NCAA automatic bid. Harvard won that playoff game at the Palestra in Philadelphia on March 14, 2015, with a score of 53\u201351, thus preventing Yale from reaching the NCAA tournament in which the Bulldogs had not appeared in 53 years. The Bulldogs won the Ivy League championship outright in 2016 with a 13\u20131 conference record to advance to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 54 years.\nThe team has appeared in eight NCAA Tournaments overall (in 1949, 1957, 1962, 2016, 2019, 2022, 2024, and 2025). On March 17, 2016, Yale defeated the Baylor Bears 79\u201375 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament for the school's first Tournament victory. In 2019 Yale beat Harvard, 97\u201385 to win its first Ivy League Men's Basketball Tournament. Yale won its second Ivy League Men's Basketball Tournament in 2022 when, on March 12, the #2 seed Yale outlasted the #3 seed University of Pennsylvania, with a score of 66\u201364. On March 22, 2024, Yale took down the 4th seeded Auburn as a 13.5 point underdog to once again pull the shocker.\nIn 2023\u201324, the Yale\u2019s Danny Wolf led the Ivy League with 310 rebounds, 247 defensive rebounds, 9.7 rebounds per game, and 1.3 blocks per game. He finished the year averaging 14.1 points per game (10th in the league), with 43 blocks (second), 63 offensive rebounds (third), 176 field goals (third), a .472 field goal percentage (fourth), and 33 steals (tenth). He earned unanimous first team All-Ivy honors, a National Association of Basketball Coaches District 13 first-team selection, was named the most outstanding player in the Ivy League tournament, and was named Academic All-District.\n\nPostseason history\nNCAA tournament results\nYale has appeared in the NCAA tournament eight times.
