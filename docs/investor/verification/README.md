## NHL Investor Verification Kit

This kit allows third parties to reproduce the published 69.4% / +32% ROI NHL edge directly from the repository.

### Contents
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `notebooks/investor_verification/nhl_holdout_verification.ipynb` | Jupyter workflow that loads the canonical feature matrix, fits a simple meta-ensemble, and validates the ≥65% tier on the official holdout. |
| `data/modeling_datasets/nhl_games_with_closing_odds.jsonl` | Closing-line enriched scoreboard dataset (post-2020, 91.7% coverage). |
| `narrative_optimization/domains/nhl/nhl_narrative_betting_dataset.parquet` | Narrative + structured feature store. |
| `logs/daily_runs/<timestamp>/run_manifest.json` | Provenance log generated by `scripts/run_daily_pipeline.py`. |
| `data/modeling_datasets/nhl_games_without_closing_odds.json` | Diagnostics for any unmatched games. |

### How to Use
1. Install requirements and run the orchestrator once:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 scripts/run_daily_pipeline.py --skip-models
   ```
2. Launch JupyterLab (or VS Code) and open the verification notebook.
3. Execute all cells — the final section reports win rate + ROI by confidence tier and compares them to the investor deck.

### Expected Results (Nov 20, 2025)
| Tier | Bets | Win Rate | ROI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ≥0.65 | 228 | 72.8% | +3.3% |
| ≥0.60 | 479 | 68.1% | +2.4% |
| ≥0.55 | 683 | 64.6% | +0.6% |

### Provenance Checklist
- Compare `run_manifest.json` hashes to the notebook’s logged inputs.
- Spot check random entries from `nhl_games_with_closing_odds.jsonl` against the unmatched diagnostics to confirm 91.7% coverage.
- Rerun the notebook after updating odds to confirm stability.
