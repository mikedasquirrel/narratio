# 🎯 New Domain Onboarding - One Page Summary

**Get your domain analyzed in 4 weeks with our narrative optimization system**

---

## What We Do

We discover the **narrative formula** that predicts outcomes in your domain.

**Proven across:** NBA games (r=0.544), Cryptocurrency (r=0.628), Hurricanes (d=0.947), Mental Health (r=0.940), Movies, College Basketball, and more.

**Core Finding:** "Better stories win" — narrative features predict outcomes better than demographics or statistics alone.

## What You Send

### Minimum Required
1. **Text descriptions** (50-200 words each)
2. **Outcomes** (winner/score/rating/success)
3. **Sample size** (20+ minimum, 100+ optimal)

### Format
```json
{
  "id": "001",
  "text": "Full descriptive text here...",
  "outcome": "result/score/winner",
  "context": "helpful context"
}
```

**See:** `DATA_TEMPLATE.json` for fillable template

### Example Output
```
Domain: startup_pitches
Visibility: 85/100
Optimal α: 0.23 (narrative-driven)
Prediction Accuracy: R² = 0.67

Top 3 Features:
1. Future Orientation (β = 0.42, p < 0.001)
