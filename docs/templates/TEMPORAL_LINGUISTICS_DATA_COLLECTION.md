## Why This Matters

### Robustness
- 65 words: Proof of concept
- **553 words: Statistically robust**
- Can detect cycles at multiple timescales
- Can validate across categories

### Coverage
- All major semantic domains
- All historical periods
- All hypothesized cycle lengths
- Complete temporal spectrum

### Power
- Detect 25-year cycles (generation)
- Detect 30-year cycles (tech)
- Detect 50-year cycles (social)
- Detect 75-year cycles (crisis)
- Detect 100+ year cycles (Victorian revival)

---

## Expected Results

### With 553 Words:

**Cycle detection:**
- Generation (25y): 50-100 words expected
- Tech (30y): 40-80 words expected
- Social (50y): 20-40 words expected
- Crisis (75y): 30-60 words expected
- Victorian (120y): 30-50 words expected

**Statistical power:**
- Can detect r > 0.10 (p < 0.05)
- Can validate hypotheses robustly
- Can predict revivals with confidence

**Framework validation:**
- Test ю predicts cyclicity across 500+ cases
- Calculate п(t) for each historical period
- Measure ة, θ, λ temporal variations
- Validate Д formula for temporal domain
